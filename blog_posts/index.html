            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the beginning of an exciting journey into building an AI-powered chatbot specifically designed to address questions about Christianity. This project combines modern AI technologies, natural language processing, and user-friendly interfaces to create an intelligent system capable of providing thoughtful, faith-based responses.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Vision Behind the Project</h2>
            <p>We set out with a simple but impactful goal: to create a chatbot that can answer questions about Christianity, offering meaningful, contextually relevant responses. Whether users are seeking comfort, clarity, or knowledge, this AI will serve as a tool for understanding and inspiration.</p>

            <h3>Why Focus on Christianity?</h3>
            <p>Christianity, like many other belief systems, has complex teachings and rich history. Many individuals—both practicing Christians and those exploring the faith—often have questions. Having a reliable digital assistant that can provide answers grounded in scripture and Christian teachings can be a valuable resource for seekers and believers alike.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Approach</h2>
            <p>Our journey started by assembling a dataset of common Christian questions and answers sourced from reputable materials. We aimed to structure these in a format that our chatbot could use efficiently. Leveraging modern natural language processing techniques, we incorporated semantic search and advanced machine learning models to enable the chatbot to retrieve and deliver relevant answers.</p>

            <h3>Key Technologies Used:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>FastAPI</strong>: A modern web framework for building APIs with Python.</li>
                <li><strong>Sentence Transformers</strong>: Used for embedding questions and answers.</li>
                <li><strong>FAISS</strong>: A library for efficient similarity search.</li>
                <li><strong>OpenAI & LLaMA (Planned)</strong>: Advanced language models for conversational responses.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Initial Steps</h2>
            <p>1. Dataset preparation.<br>
               2. Building the API with FastAPI.<br>
               3. Initial testing with Sentence Transformers and FAISS.<br>
               4. Future plans for LLM integration.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
            <p>We faced model access limitations and the challenge of balancing complexity with performance, which taught us the value of modular, scalable design.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>What’s Next?</h2>
            <p>Our next steps include user testing, integrating OpenAI for conversational responses, and scaling the system to handle larger datasets and more complex conversations.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The road to building a conversational AI chatbot for Christianity is an ongoing journey filled with learning, challenges, and growth. We are excited to share these experiences with you and hope this project becomes a meaningful resource for many.</p>
