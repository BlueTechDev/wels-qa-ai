# Building an AI-Powered Question-Answering System with WELS Data

## Introduction
In this project, we are harnessing the power of modern natural language processing to build a sophisticated question-answering (QA) system using data from WELS. By creating vector embeddings for the data and integrating with an open-source LLM like LLaMA, we aim to create a robust system that can provide informative and contextually appropriate responses.

## Phase 1: Preparing the Data
Our journey began by cleaning and structuring the WELS data into a JSONL format that could be used for embedding generation. We ensured that each data entry had clear `prompt` and `completion` fields to facilitate effective training.

## Phase 2: Generating Vector Embeddings
The next step involved generating vector embeddings for the cleaned data using a pre-trained model from `sentence-transformers`. These embeddings allow us to find semantically similar content quickly and efficiently.

## Phase 3: Integrating with LLaMA
With the embeddings in place, we integrated LLaMA, an open-source large language model, to handle user queries and generate insightful responses based on the most relevant content found via vector search.

## Next Steps
Our next milestone involves deploying the system with a simple interface using FastAPI or Flask to allow real-time interaction with users.

Stay tuned for more updates as we progress!
