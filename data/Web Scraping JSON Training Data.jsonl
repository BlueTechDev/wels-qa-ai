{"prompt": "Having the Holy Spirit", "completion": "I know that Jesus died for my sins, but I'm worried that I don't actually have the Holy Spirit? How do I know? Can you suggest some Scripture passages that would give me comfort when I am unsure?\n\n\nFrom the information you provided with your question, I take it that you not only \u201cknow\u201d that Jesus died for your sins but that the Holy Spirit has led you to trust in Jesus Christ as your Savior. Knowledge of Jesus is one thing, but Spirit-worked faith is what brings into our lives all the blessings Jesus won by his holy life and sacrificial death.\nWhen God brought you to saving faith, he did so through his Holy Spirit, \u201cwhom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior\u201d (Titus 3:6). The Holy Spirit now dwells in you. Twice in his first letter to the Corinthians the apostle Paul asked a question that reminds Christians that the Holy Spirit lives in them. \u201cDon\u2019t you know that you yourselves are God\u2019s temple and that God\u2019s Spirit lives in you?\u201d (1 Corinthians 3:16) \u201cDo you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God?\u201d (1 Corinthians 6:19)\nThe same apostle reminds us that the indwelling of the Holy Spirit signifies God\u2019s ownership of us: \u201cAnd you also were included in Christ when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation. Having believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God\u2019s possessions\u2014to the praise of his glory\u201d (Ephesians 1:13-14).\nOther passages that assure Christians like you that \u201cyou have the Holy Spirit\u201d are:\n\u201cNo one can say, \u2018Jesus is Lord,\u2019 except by the Holy Spirit\u201d (1 Corinthians 12:3).\n\u201cNow it is God who makes both us and you stand firm in Christ. He anointed us, set his seal of ownership on us, and put his Spirit in our hearts as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come\u201d (2 Corinthians 1:21-22).\n\u201cBecause you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son in our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, \u2018Abba, Father\u2019\u201d (Galatians 4:6).\n\u201cAnd in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit\u201d (Ephesians 2:22).\n\u201cThose who obey his commands live in him, and he in them. And this is how we know that he lives in us: We know it by the Spirit he gave us\u201d (1 John 3:24).\nYou have the right idea with your question: looking to Scripture to find reassurance of God\u2019s love for you and his presence in your life. God bless your remembrance of passages like these.\nAnswered by James Pope, professor at Martin Luther College, New Ulm, Minn. Pope is a contributing editor to Forward in Christ magazine.

{"prompt": "Symbolism of Advent wreath", "completion": "I was just wondering if you could tell me about the symbolism of the candles on the Advent wreath, and of the wreath itself if it applies.\n\n\nAs with many long-standing customs, the origins of the Advent wreath are somewhat debated. Some histories of the advent wreath say that Christians simply adapted an even earlier custom from pre-Christian Germanic tribes. Supposedly, then, these pagan people tried to break the darkness of winter with candles and invoke the sun god to return with the warmth and light of spring. In addition, the evergreen wreath would remind them that there is still life and the circle of time would again come back to spring.\nAccording to this viewpoint, Christians later placed new and Biblical meaning to the old customs. Now the candles pointed to Jesus, the Light of the world (John 3:17-21.) The evergreen wreath now reminded believers that our Savior God grants new and everlasting life in Jesus. The wreath was also a symbol of victory, for a garland wreath was often placed on victors in contests or conquests. So naturally, a Christian can think of the crown of life that Jesus has won for us. The four candles in an Advent wreath would then emphasize the four week period of penitance and preparation during Advent, as we eagerly await the coming of the Light of the world to bring new life and hope.\nThe advent wreath became quite popular in homes in post-Reformation Germany. It seems pretty certain that in many German homes families had a custom of lighting four candles during advent, candles placed in a wreath of evergreens. When these candles were lit, Scripture and prayer was part of the custom and the family devotion time was a time of instructing the children about Christ\u2019s coming. Later, the custom crossed over different denominational lines and other faith traditions adapted its use. Today, you can find Advent wreathes in many Protestant and Roman churches.\nSince the custom has seen so many different adaptations, you will also find numerous explanations of the four candles. (If there is a fifth, a white candle in the center, it is called the Christ Candle, and is lit on Christmas.) Some call the first candle the Prophecy Candle, or the Hope Candle, or the Expectation Candle. It reminded believers that God had promised throughout the Old Testament that he would send a Messiah, the Shepherd King, to save his people. The second candle is called the Bethlehem candle, or sometimes the Peace Candle. (Others call it the Preparation candle.) The third candle is sometimes called the shepherds\u2019 candle or the joy candle. It was often a pink color. The fourth candle is called the angel candle or the love candle. Naturally, for all of these themes, appropriate Scripture references could be used to help hearers and worshippers consider the various Advent themes of preparation, repentance, fulfillment of promises, the joy of Christ\u2019s coming.\nThe colors of the advent candles also vary. The oldest tradition had three purple candles, for purple was the color of royalty and repentance. How else would God\u2019s people prepare for the coming of the King of kings? On the third Sunday in Advent the rose or pink candle was lit. This is the candle that emphasized the joy of the shepherds as they heard the news. More recently, one sees all four candles in a deep blue color, reflecting the liturgical color of Advent that is quite common now. Blue is the color that reminds us of heaven and the expectation we have that Jesus is coming again. Blue is quite common in Lutheran churches since Lutheran Christians often emphasize the meaning of Advent as the season of coming. The readings then remind us of Christ\u2019s first coming in all humility. We remember also his promise that he will come again in glory. And we also pray that he come into our hearts through the Spirit\u2019s gracious working with the Gospel, so that with the gift of faith we now are heirs of that heavenly glory through Christ. Notice how often Advent hymns interweave these three \u201ccomings\u201d of Christ!\nThe four candles remind us that in the four weeks of Advent we are preparing for the coming of the Christ Child, who is the light of the world. The wreath of evergreen could also help a person think of the victory and the new and everlasting life we have in Jesus. Blessings on your Advent prepation to welcome the King, our Savior Jesus."}
{"prompt": "Suicide and Heaven", "completion": "I've been told that if you commit suicide, you can't go to heaven because it's a sign of unbelief. What does the Bible say? Are there known cases in the Bible where someone has committed suicide and has gone to heaven?\n\n\nThe Bible reports six cases of suicide: Abimelech (Judges 9:52-54), Saul (1 Samuel 31:4), Saul\u2019s armor-bearer (1 Samuel 31:5), Ahithophel (2 Samuel 17:23), Zimri (1 Kings 16:15-20), and Judas Iscariot (Matthew 27:3-5). Some would include Samson (Judges 16:25-30) in the list, yet his death was not a selfish act of self destruction but a self-sacrificing act similar to that of a soldier who sacrifices himself for his fellow soldiers. His final act did not reflect despair and hopelessness but a prayerful trust in the true God. For this reason he is mentioned among the people of faith in Hebrews 11:32. However, this was not the case with the other six that were mentioned above. They acted in despair and unbelief and forfeited any hope of heaven.\nBut even though the examples of suicide mentioned in the Bible are all negative, this does not mean that every person who takes his or her own life is eternally lost. Perhaps a person is suffering from a pyschological disorder. Like other organs and parts of the body, the brain can also malfunction. Or perhaps someone in a moment of emotion crisis acts rashly and takes his or her own life. We cannot say in each of these cases that the person acted in unbelief. And finally it is unbelief that condemns us to eternal punishment, not any particular sin per se. Likewise it is trust in the crucified and risen Savior that saves us\u2014not because we lived a good life, and not because we died a good death, but because he lived and died in our place."}
{"prompt": "Lutherans and Baptists", "completion": "What is the difference between confessional Lutheran beliefs and the beliefs of Baptists?\n\n\nWe can only answer your question in a general way. There are between thirty and forty different kinds of Baptists in the United States alone, so they do not all believe and teach precisely the same things. But they have general traits that can be mentioned here.\nIn most Baptist doctrinal statements there are portions that are basically identical with ours, such as a high view of the authority and accuracy of the Bible, the importance and reality of Jesus Christ and his work as our substitute, and the confession of mankind\u2019s sin and need for the Savior as well as God\u2019s grace and saving work for us. In short, there is much to be thankful for, since fundamental Christianity is confessed here.\nYou asked about differences. First of all they reject the sacraments (both Baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper) as instruments through which God graciously creates or strengthens faith in human hearts. They treat the sacraments as \u201cordinances\u201d to be obeyed, and being baptized or receiving communion is an \u201cact of obedience\u201d and something WE do rather than primarily a tool of God to give blessings.\nBaptism: Southern Baptists believe that baptism is an act of obedience symbolizing a believer\u2019s faith. They do not baptize infants. We believe that baptism is a means of grace through which the Holy Spirit works faith, offers and conveys the forgiveness of sins, life, and salvation (Titus 3:5-7, Acts 2:38, Acts 22:16, 1 Peter 3:21). We believe that infants are to be baptized because they are included in Christ\u2019s command to baptize all nations (Matthew 28:19). They are sinful and need to be born again (Psalm 51:5, John 3:5-6). Babies also can believe (Luke 18:15-17).\nLord\u2019s Supper: The Southern Baptists believe that the Lord\u2019s Supper is a symbolic act of obedience whereby members of the church memorialize the death of Jesus. They deny the real presence in the Lord\u2019s Supper. We believe that Christ\u2019s true body and blood are given with the bread and wine to assure us that our sins are forgiven (Matthew 26:26-28, 1 Corinthians 11:23-29, 1 Corinthians 10:16-17).\nMost Baptists believe we can cooperate in our conversion, making a decision for Christ. Lutherans believe we cooperate with the Holy Spirit only after our conversion. He is completely responsible for the change that takes place in our conversion.\nWe believe in election to salvation as taught in Ephesians 1. The Bible clearly says there is no predestination to damnation, but God wants all to be saved.\nMany Baptists hold to a concept called \u201conce saved, always saved\u201d that they called \u201ceternal security.\u201d We believe a person can fall from faith because the Bible says he can (Hebrews 10:26-31, 1 Corinthians 10:12). We don\u2019t base this conclusion on reason. But in this case the principle is the same as a common principle of daily life: if I give you a gift of money, you have not done anything to earn it, but if you foolishly throw it away you lose the benefit of the gift. Faith and forgiveness is a pure gift, but the person who throws them away loses the blessing that was his."}
{"prompt": "Lutherans and Methodists", "completion": "In what ways are Lutherans different from United Methodists?\n\n\nThere are many differences between the United Methodists and Lutherans. I will note some of the most basic.\nFollowing the father of Methodism, John Wesley, United Methodist theology is basically Arminian. The United Methodists teach that unconverted people have free will in spiritual matters or the ability to accept or reject God\u2019s offer of salvation.\nLutherans teach that unconverted human beings are dead in their trespasses and sins (Ephesians 2:1, 5), hostile to God (Romans 8:6-8), and cannot accept the gospel message (1 Corinthians 2:14). Human beings play no part in their own conversion, but are purely passive.\nThe United Methodists teach that God\u2019s \u201cprevenient grace\u201d surrounds all humanity and \u201cprompts our first wish to please God\u201d and \u201cour first glimmer of understanding of God\u2019s will.\u201d This grace surrounds everyone whether they have ever heard the gospel or not. Lutherans believe that God\u2019s grace comes to us only through the means of grace, the gospel in God\u2019s Word and the sacraments. There is no salvation apart from the means of grace (Romans 10:13-17).\nLutherans put the primary theological emphasis on justification and what God has done for us in sending his Son to live and die for us, forgiving all of our sins and giving us eternal life and salvation. Methodists put their primary theological emphasis on sanctification and what God does in us to lead us to do his will. Lutherans teach that every Christian is both sinner and saint at the same time and will remain so until we reach the perfection of heaven. Methodists teach the possibility of reaching Christian perfection in this life.\nThe United Methodists see Scripture as the primary source and criterion for Christian doctrine. They emphasize the importance of tradition, experience, and reason for Christian doctrine. Lutherans teach that the Bible is the sole source for Christian doctrine. The truths of Scripture do not need to be authenticated by tradition, human experience, or reason. Scripture is self authenticating and is true in and of itself.\nThe United Methodists believe that the church has a responsibility toward the structures of society and therefore commit themselves \u201cto the rights of men, women, children, youth, young adults, the aging, and people with disabilities; to improvement of the quality of life; and to the rights and dignity of racial, ethnic, and religious minorities . . . collective bargaining, and responsible consumption; and in the elimination of economic and social distress.\u201d\nLutherans believe that God has given the church the commission to proclaim the gospel and administer the sacraments so that people can be saved for eternity (Matthew 28:18-20). God has not called the church to reform society or to wield the law as a curb for societal ills. God has instituted the government for that purpose (Romans 13:1-7). As the church carries out its responsibility of proclaiming the gospel and there are more Christians in a country, society will be affected. For individual Christians as citizens will work to address the problems that they see and to improve society. The Christians are then carrying out their responsibility as citizens and are not carrying out the work of the church. We reject the social gospel, the belief that the church\u2019s responsibility is to change the structures of society through mass or group action."}
{"prompt": "Lutherans and Presbyterians", "completion": "I would like to know the differences between what the Presbyterians believe and what Lutherans believe.\n\n\nJust as all churches that bear the name \u201cLutheran\u201d\u00a0do not teach the same as other \u201cLutherans,\u201d so not all churches that bear the name \u201cPresbyterian\u201d teach exactly the same. We can, however,\u00a0speak of what Presbyterians believed historically and compare it with what confessional Lutherans believe.\nHistorically, as strict Calvinists, Presbyterians taught that from eternity God elected some to be saved and some to be damned (double predestination). By no means do all Presbyterians believe this today. Confessional Lutherans believe that from eternity God chose those whom he would convert through the gospel and preserve in faith to eternal life. See Ephesians 1:4-6; Romans 8:29,30). Confessional Lutherans reject the notion that unbelievers were predestined to damnation, for \u201cGod does not will that any should perish\u201d (see 1 Timothy 2:4 and 2 Peter 3:9).\nHistorically, and as a corollary of the Calvinist belief in double predestination, Presbyterians taught that Christ atoned for the sins only of those predestined for life in heaven. Confessional Lutherans believe that Jesus Christ, the God-man, was sent by the Father to atone for the sins of all people, and that he did so. See Romans 5:18,19; Isaiah 53:6; 2 Corinthians 5:19; and John 1:29.\nHistorically, Presbyterians believed that it is impossible for a believer to fall from the faith. Confessional Lutherans believe that it is possible for believers to fall from faith. See 1 Corinthians 10:12.\nHistorically, Presbyterians have believed that Sunday has replaced Saturday as the Sabbath, to be observed in a way similar to the Old Testament regulations. Confessional Lutherans believe that New Testament believers are free to gather for worship on Sunday (or any other day), without special rules regarding work or recreation. See Colossians 2:16,17: \u201cDo not let anyone judge you . . . with regard to a Sabbath day. These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ.\u201d\nThe name \u201cPresbyterian\u201d means \u201chaving elders (teaching and ruling or presiding),\u201d as the only form of church government that has God\u2019s approval. Confessional Lutherans believe that the Lord has instituted and provides for the gospel ministry, but that there are no commands in the New Testament as to forms of organization.\nLike other Protestant (non-Lutheran) churches, Presbyterians do not believe that Baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper are means of grace\u2014forms of the gospel through which the Holy Spirit gives and strengthens faith. Confessional Lutherans believe that Baptism gives new life (Titus 3:5) and cleanses from all sin (Acts 2:38). Confessional Lutherans believe that as believers receive Christ\u2019s body and blood under the bread and wine they also receive the forgiveness of sins (Matthew 26:28; 1 Corinthians 10:16).Presbyterians do not believe communicants receive the Lord\u2019s Body and Blood in his Supper."}
{"prompt": "Leadership and authority", "completion": "In a society that stresses equality between men and women, why do most confessional Lutherans and other conservative churches choose to limit leadership and authority roles in congregations to men?\n\n\nWe do believe and teach that men and women enjoy equal status and importance before God. Both men and women were\u00a0created in the perfect holiness of the image of God (Genesis 1:27). Although that was lost in the fall into sin when as both men and women we became equally sinful before God (Romans 3:23), yet in Christ\u2019s life, death, and resurrection for us God has restored to us our position as his justified and holy children (Romans 3:24). As far as our status and importance\u00a0before him as dearly loved children and heirs of heaven, whether we are female or male makes absolutely no difference (Galatians 3:26-29).\nHowever, Scripture is also clear that while we are equal in status and importance before him, God has not made us duplicates or clones of each other in how we carry out our various God-given callings. Already in the perfection of the Garden of Eden he assigned unique callings or roles to the man and the woman when God made her to be helper suitable for the man and created her right from the man (Genesis 2:18ff). God gave to\u00a0the man the unique calling of being a loving head and to his wife the unique calling of being a loving helper to him. In the New Testament, the inspired Apostle Paul assures us that these unique callings were indeed found already in the perfection of Eden when he writes, \u201cNow I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God\u201d (1 Corinthians 11:3). Later Paul reminds us that what we read in Genesis 2 is indeed where this was established when he says, \u201cFor man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created for woman but woman for man\u201d (1 Corinthians 11:8-9).\nWhile man\u2019s headship is intended by God to be lived out in loving servant humility like Christ for us (Ephesians 5:25), yet\u00a0headship also includes the\u00a0God-given authority to lead (Hebrews 13:17). That is why one part of the\u00a0unique calling of helper is\u00a0to respect and yield (submit) to that leadership (Ephesians 5:22).\nIn the church,\u00a0one of the places that\u00a0those charged with leadership in our congregations\u00a0exercise such authority is in the voters\u2019 assembly. There those charged with setting the direction of the congregation set that path in the debate and voting that takes place. Just as Paul reminds us that teaching the Word with authority is an expression of the headship principle (1 Timothy 2:12), so also it is an exercise of authority when the governing bodies of our congregations set the direction for that congregation.\nOf course, wise heads\u00a0know that God has given them helpers for a reason. The wisdom and insights, the questions and concerns of everyone in the congregation, men\u00a0and women,\u00a0are important. Especially when a woman may have no husband\u00a0in her home, it is very important that the congregation look for ways to\u00a0gain her input.\nDoes WELS stand out as different among other Lutheran church bodies in so honoring the principle of head and helper? Yes. But does that mean we are closed minded and old fashioned, or does that mean\u00a0others have been more affected by the culture around them than they may\u00a0know? The question is never what the culture demands, but what the\u00a0Scriptures teach."}
{"prompt": "Giving up something for Lent", "completion": "How is the Lenten Season celebrated/practiced in the Lutheran religion? Do you abstain from any certain types of foods on certain days? In the Catholic religion, it is customary to \"give up\" something for lent like chocolate or something that you really enjoy. Is this practiced in the Lutheran Religion?\n\n\nGenerally, Lutherans do not \u201cgive up\u201d something for Lent, although the practice is not unknown among Lutherans. Going without something can be helpful when it reminds us on a daily basis that the Lord Jesus gave up his life so that we might be freed from the curse of our sins. St. Paul reminded the Corinthians: \u201cFor you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich\u201d (Corinthians 8:9). This is a good reason for what is sometimes called \u201cLenten self-denial.\u201d\nLutherans tend to steer away from Lenten self-denial, however, because it has so often been abused in the Christian Church. Too many people \u201cgive something up\u201d during Lent because they think they are making points with God, earning by their self-denial at least a little part of his forgiveness. The Bible rejects this thought completely. Peter wrote: \u201cFor you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your forefathers, but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect\u201d (1 Peter 1:18-19). In the hymn \u201cRock of Ages\u201d we sing, \u201cNothing in my hands I bring; simply to thy cross I cling.\u201d\nLutherans believe that the forgiveness of sins is God\u2019s free gift to human beings. They believe that God forgives sins because Jesus met the demands God made of sinners. In the place of sinners, Jesus lived perfectly and obeyed all the laws God had set down for sinners. In the place of sinners, Jesus died, enduring the punishment God had decreed for sinners.\nBecause they believe that forgiveness is theirs because of Jesus\u2019 life and death, Lutherans focus on Jesus\u2019 life and death during the season of Lent. On the Sundays of Lent they watch as Jesus battles and overcomes Satan and his cohorts. During special services during the week, most Lutherans review the story of Jesus\u2019 final days on earth\u2013his visit to the Garden of Gethsemane, his betrayal, arrest, trial, crucifixion, death, and burial."}
{"prompt": "Dinosaurs", "completion": "Were there really dinosaurs on earth? If so, when and how is this compatible with the Genesis account of creation? \n\n\nThese are frequently asked questions, and important ones, since opposing viewpoints thrive and conflicting worldviews rest on differing assumptions.\nDINOSAURS? YES.\nWhile we can\u2019t absolutely rule out the idea that dinosaur fossils were created by God and aren\u2019t evidence of extinct creatures, we consider it most probable that various dinosaurs did indeed exist. And we\u2019re well aware that some Christians are reluctant to accept this evidence because they think it conflicts with biblical revelation.\nWe are less certain what these extinct creatures really looked like. Dinosaur fossils usually consist of fragments. Even if scientists find nearly complete skeletons, they still must guess what the animal originally looked like. Questions abound: Were they sluggish or swift, cold-blooded or warm-blooded? Were they fat or slim, hairy or feathered? Reconstructing dinosaurs from fossil remnants involves much guesswork and yields frequent disagreement among scholars. Answers are elusive, and speculation is widespread despite occasional knowledge of significant skeletal structures.\nPREHISTORIC? NO.\nWorking with evolutionary assumptions, many claim this animal group existed between 230 million and 65 million years ago, with individual species of dinosaurs continually evolving and going extinct. The bony fossils don\u2019t establish that timetable; these conclusions stem from evolutionary preconceptions coupled with dating methods that reflect an evolutionary bias. When presented as \u201cscientifically proven,\u201d however, this timetable intimidates Christians.\nRelying on Bible information, we believe dinosaurs were created on day five and/or day six of creation (Genesis 1:20-25). Precisely when and why they became extinct is not revealed. Despite hundreds of dinosaur \u201cnames\u201d in use today, there may well have been relatively few \u201ckinds\u201d of dinosaurs taken on Noah\u2019s ark. If they were still living at the time of the great flood, each kind was represented on board the vessel.\nHow long they existed after the flood we don\u2019t know. An examination of ancient literature from varying geographical areas reveals compelling evidence that \u201cdragons\u201d were real animals comparable to modern reconstructions of dinosaurs. Biblical descriptions of certain creatures may well be references to now extinct dinosaurs (Job 40:15-21 and Job 41, for example). Losing species to extinction (currently estimated at more than 27,000 species per year) seems to be a long-standing phenomenon on earth since the fall.\nCOMPATIBLE WITH SCRIPTURE? YES.\nThe main debate over dinosaurs isn\u2019t about the fossil evidence itself but flows from different assumptions about time and history. Those assumptions are coupled with limitations of evidence and of human ability to know details in the history of God\u2019s creation. It\u2019s really about the most trustworthy source of information. Is it God\u2019s incomplete yet adequate account of earth\u2019s history? Or man\u2019s incomplete, changing, and inadequate theories drawn from limited and ambiguous discoveries bolstered by evolutionary presuppositions? The Christian approach is to walk by faith. The reality of dinosaurs is fully compatible with Scripture and Christian conviction.\nWhenever we revisit this topic, vital truths come to mind. The praiseworthy power of God coupled with his love of diversity in his creation is highlighted. The devastating impact of sin, contributing to the extinction of dinosaurs and so many other animals and plants, merits sober reflection. When striving to grasp details of earth\u2019s early history with our limitations, we can appreciate the wisdom of this sentiment: \u201cThe secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may follow all the words of this law\u201d (Deuteronomy 29:29). Ultimately we praise God for revealing his remedy for sin and his key to releasing all creatures from sin\u2019s consequences: the redemptive work of Jesus Christ."}

{"prompt": "Lutherans and Mormons", "completion": "What are the big difference between Lutheran and Mormon beliefs?\n\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is the official name for Mormonism. Their television commercials are very appealing and family oriented, but Mormonism cannot be considered a Christian denomination.\nThe Latter Day Saints deny the scriptural doctrine of the Trinity. They teach that there are many gods and human beings can become gods themselves through a kind of spiritual evolution. Mormons are taught \u201cAs man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may become.\u201d Mormonism denies the scriptural teaching of justification by grace alone through faith in Jesus and teaches a system of salvation by works. They teach that people are born inherently good and have the freedom to make the right decisions. They believe that people progress by making wise use of this freedom.\nMormons practice \u201cbaptism for the dead.\u201d They believe that the spirits of the dead can accept Mormonism in the spirit world, but since they don\u2019t have a body they cannot be baptized. Since Mormon baptism is essential for spiritual progression, Mormons can be baptized in the place of a departed relative. This is the reason why Mormonism places such an emphasis on genealogy.\nMormons teach that there are three spirit kingdoms to which the spirits of the dead can go. The Celestial Kingdom is the highest kingdom and is reserved for faithful Mormons and those who die before the age of eight. The Terrestrial Kingdom is for moral non-Mormons and less \u201cvaliant\u201d Mormons. The Telestial Kingdom is the place where most people will go after suffering for their sins. This is the kingdom of the least glory.\nThe Mormons accept the following as scripture: The Bible, The Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price.

Galatians; Colossians 2; Hebrews 4-10).\u00a0 Jesus rendered perfect obedience to the law of God; he was our perfect substitute in life (Romans 10:4).\nThat leaves us with the \u201cmoral\u201d law.\u00a0 That is often defined as God\u2019s will for all people of all time.\u00a0 The moral law is every command of God that applies to every person, no matter when or where he or she may live.\u00a0 People naturally have knowledge of the moral law because God\u2019s law is written in their hearts (Romans 2:14-15).\u00a0 The Ten Commandments serve as a good summary of the moral law (even though there are references to civil law and ceremonial law in them).\nWhile it would be nice if Old Testament laws were packaged and labeled \u201ccivil law\u201d and \u201cceremonial law,\u201d that is not the case.\u00a0 Still, we can identify laws that were binding only on Old Testament Israel (the civil and ceremonial laws), and we can identify laws that reflect the moral law in that they direct all people of all time to love God and their neighbor.\u00a0 God grant you patience and wisdom as you witness to others through social media."}
{"prompt": "Infant Baptism", "completion": "Does WELS practice infant baptism?\n\n\nYes, we baptize infants. We do so because they have a need for forgiveness (Psalm 51:5), they too are included in the command to baptize \u201call nations\u201d (Matthew 28:19-20), and they can believe through the power of the Holy Spirit (Matthew 18:6; Luke 18:15-17). We are grateful that God has this means of reaching out to infants and including them in his kingdom."}
{"prompt": "Baptism creating faith", "completion": "Where does it say in Scripture that Baptism creates faith?\n\n\nWe will not find a passage in the Bible that states specifically and succinctly: \u201cBaptism creates faith.\u201d We know that baptism is a faith-working act on God\u2019s part by looking at several Bible passages and seeing how they relate to baptism.\nThe Bible explains that people enjoy the forgiveness of sins and eternal life by God\u2019s grace through faith in Jesus Christ his Son (Ephesians 2:8; Romans 3:28). The Bible states that baptism gives people those very blessings of life and forgiveness (Acts 2:38; 22:16; Ephesians 5:26; Titus 3:5-7; 1 Peter 3:21). Baptism gives those blessings because of the powerful word of God that is attached to the water.\nSince the Bible teaches that we enjoy salvation only through faith in Christ, and since the Bible teaches that baptism saves us and washes away our sins, we can rightfully say that baptism creates the faith that connects us to Jesus and brings into our lives all the blessings he won by his holy life, sacrificial death and glorious resurrection.\nWe have every reason to grow in our appreciation for baptism by which we are clothed in Jesus\u2019 robe of righteousness (Galatians 3:27)."}
{"prompt": "Jesus' baptism", "completion": "I just heard a sermon about Jesus being baptized. Why wasn't Jesus baptized as an infant? Why did he wait so long?\n\n\nIt\u2019s not a silly question at all. Baptism itself was not performed until the time of John the Baptist, and Jesus did not command baptism until the time of his ascension into heaven. What was available for Jesus as an infant was circumcision, and the Bible tells us that Joseph and Mary followed God\u2019s directive of having Jesus circumcised when he was a week old (Luke 2:21). It was at that time that the Lord was given the name \u201cJesus,\u201d just as the angel had instructed Mary (Luke 1:31) and Joseph (Matthew 1:21).\nBut more than baptism not being available at the time of Jesus\u2019 birth is the unique reason for Jesus\u2019 baptism. You and I have every reason to be baptized very early in life because we are conceived and born in sin and we need forgiveness of sins through saving faith in Christ. Jesus entered our world as \u201cthe holy one\u201d (Luke 1:35). Through his conception by the Holy Spirit and birth of the virgin Mary, Jesus became a human being without a sinful nature, without a trace of sin. So, even if baptism had been available at the time of Jesus\u2019 birth, he did not need baptism for the reasons that you and I have.\nSo, why was Jesus baptized? And why was he baptized when he was about thirty years of age? (Luke 3:23) Jesus answered those questions when he told John the Baptist to baptize him \u201cto fulfill all righteousness\u201d (Matthew 3:15). Jesus, the Son of God, became a man to fulfill all the prophecies of the Messiah; Jesus came into the world he created to carry out everything in his Father\u2019s plan of salvation. Being baptized was part of that plan.\n\u201cMessiah\u201d and \u201cChrist\u201d both mean \u201cthe anointed one.\u201d Jesus\u2019 baptism was an anointing as he was about to embark on his public ministry of teaching and preaching and displaying his power (Isaiah 61:1-2). Jesus\u2019 baptism clearly identified him as the Son of God (Matthew 3:16-17) who came into the world to live and die in our place, to win our forgiveness. For that reason Jesus\u2019 baptism is important to us\u2014as is our own baptism."}
{"prompt": "Infants believing before baptism", "completion": "Is it possible for infants to believe before they are baptized?\n\n\nYes, it is possible. The apostle Paul reminded Timothy: \u201cFrom infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus\u201d (2 Timothy 3:15). Luke 18:15-17 describes people bringing children (including infants \u2013 the word translated as \u201cbabies\u201d in verse 15) to Jesus. The Lord said \u201cthe kingdom of God belongs to such as these\u201d (Luke 18:16). \u201cThese\u201d are children, including infants. Individuals become part of the kingdom of God through Christian faith worked in the heart by the Holy Spirit.\nBecause conversion is God\u2019s gracious, powerful act, he can bring people to faith through his word alone or his word attached to an earthly element: baptism."}
{"prompt": "Baptized more than once?", "completion": "My boyfriend told me he would like to get baptized again. He mentioned the desire to become baptized again was strengthened after reading his devotional, which was a passage in Romans. Please clarify WELS' belief on the need for only one baptism. Thank you.\n\n\nIf baptism were something we did for God, we might want to be baptized again\u2014and again. But, the truth of the matter\u2014the biblical truth\u2014is that baptism is something God does for us. Through baptism God comes to people and gives them faith, life and forgiveness (Acts 2:38; Titus 3:5; 1 Peter 3:21).\nWhile Jesus tells us to receive the Lord\u2019s Supper often, there is no command, or even example, in the Bible that tells us we are to be baptized more than once. The book of Romans speaks of baptism as a singular event in our lives (Romans 6:1-2). That may or may not have been the basis of the devotion your boyfriend read. I don\u2019t know.\nThe blessings of baptism last a lifetime\u2014even beyond. If at some point in our life we gain a new appreciation for baptism, that is reason to think all the more of how greatly God blessed us at baptism, not a reason to be baptized again.\nPerhaps your boyfriend read that infant baptism is not valid. In that case, the material he read was not accurate. Again, baptism is what God does for people. Through water and the word he comes to people, even infants, and brings his blessings. How grateful we are for that."}
{"prompt": "Who can baptize?", "completion": "Who can baptize? Do Lutherans allow lay people to baptize?\n\n\nThe power of baptism rests in Jesus\u2019 promise (John 3:5,6; Titus 3:5,6; 1 Peter 3:21), not in the person doing the baptizing. For that reason, the Lutheran church recognizes the validity of baptisms performed by laypeople. This often happens (and properly so) when there is an emergency, i.e., a situation where the candidate\u2019s survival is in doubt.\nA number of needs are met, however, by having a pastor do the baptizing. These include: good order, absolute clarity about whether the person was baptized, a clear public statement that the person is being baptized by the officiating church and into the church, and (if done in a worship service) an opportunity to remind the congregation of their own baptism and its blessings. That\u2019s why baptism by a pastor during a worship service is our normal practice."}
{"prompt": "Disposing old Bible", "completion": "I have an old Bible from grade school that is of no use to me (it has been torn up and written over). Is there a proper, respectful way to dispose of a used Bible?\n\n\nThere are different proper, respectful ways of disposing of a used Bible, but there is no specified way. I have heard and read of people burying their used Bibles and others recycling them so that the pages can be turned into something new and useful (perhaps another Bible). The approaches to disposing of a used Bible vary, but the approaches are driven by respect for what people are discarding. You can dispose of your old Bible in any number of ways that do not bother you or your conscience.\nTo me, your concern about what to do with a used Bible reflects a love for the Word of God in general (Psalm 119:105-112). That is a wonderful attitude. God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Standing for Bible readings", "completion": "Please explain how come sometimes we will stand for the readings during church service and other times we will not. Pastor says, \"Out of respect for Jesus' words, please stand.\" But another reading will be from the Bible, etc. and we will not stand. Thanks!\n\n\nChristian Worship: Manual, the \u201chandbook\u201d for our hymnal, explains: \u201cThe congregation stands for the reading of the Gospel. In the past soldiers put down their weapons and kings removed their crowns when the Gospel was read. Christ\u2014his life, his words of law and gospel, his suffering, his death, his resurrection, his ascension, his assignment to his Church, his promise to return\u2014is the center of the Gospel. The faithful have waited for this moment, this reading. They stand in reverence. \u201d (pp. 173-174)\nThrough the gospel lesson Jesus\u2014the Word (John 1), the Word of God (Revelation 19:13)\u2014comes to us. The gospel lesson relays the words and works of Christ. For those reasons, we have retained an ancient practice of showing respect and awe for the Lord and his gospel by standing.\nThat practice of course falls into the category of adiaphora: those things that God has neither commanded nor forbidden. In Christian freedom we gladly include that posture in our liturgy."}
{"prompt": "Bible is God's Word", "completion": "How do I know the Bible is the Word of God?\n\n\nThis is an extremely important question. \u201cBecause the Bible says it\u2019s God\u2019s Word\u201d is the short answer, but one that most people won\u2019t be satisfied with. It\u2019s certainly true that the Bible says it is God\u2019s Word (2 Peter 1:20, 21). Just think of how many prophetic books in the Bible begin with, \u201cThe word of the LORD came to\u201d or how often the prophets introduce their words with, \u201cThis is what the LORD says.\u201d\nOn the other hand, most people who pose the question want corroboration from an independent, outside source that proves that the Bible is God\u2019s Word. And that, of course, is the problem. What independent outside sources are there? God is one, of course\u2014but the Bible is the only Word of God that we have, and the Bible itself tells us not to expect any other (Isaiah 8:20, Revelation 22:18, 19). God isn\u2019t going to speak from heaven and tell us, \u201cThis is my book. Believe it!\u201d\nHuman beings are the only other possibility. But human beings are hardly unbiased or impartial. As they are by nature, they have every reason not to believe the Bible\u2019s claims about itself. That\u2019s one reason why arguments that believers find persuasive\u2014like biblical prophecies that were clearly and obviously fulfilled, or the fact that the Bible is still around despite centuries of being vehemently attacked and suppressed\u2014don\u2019t necessarily convince unbelievers.\nFortunately, the Bible doesn\u2019t need independent corroboration, because it is self-authenticating. The best advice we can give to someone who is wondering whether the Bible is God\u2019s Word is, \u201cRead it, and you\u2019ll find out.\u201d You\u2019ll discover a book by people you\u2019ve never met, and yet who know you better than you know yourself. And you\u2019ll find them leading you straight to your loving Savior. That is finally the only \u201cproof\u201d that the Bible really needs."}
{"prompt": "Who wrote the Bible?", "completion": "Who wrote the Bible?\n\n\nPicture this: the CEO of the company is dictating a letter to the secretary. As the CEO speaks, the secretary takes down every word. When the CEO is done, it\u2019s clearly the CEO\u2019s letter.\nAt the same time, the secretary\u2019s abilities, skills, etc., are sure to show through. For example, if the secretary has poor eyesight, the letter will probably be typed in a larger font. Yet, the letter remains the CEO\u2019s.\nAlthough simplistic, that basically illustrates how we got the Bible. God is the \u201cCEO,\u201d various human writers are the \u201csecretaries.\u201d God gave the writers the exact words which He wanted them to use. The Bible describes it this way: \u201cAll Scripture is God-breathed\u201d (2 Timothy 3:16 ). Similarly, \u201cFor prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit\u201d (2 Peter 1:21 ). Often in the Old Testament (written about 1400-400 B.C.) you\u2019ll hear God say something like, \u201cTake a scroll and write on it all the words I have spoken to you\u201d (Jeremiah 36:2). These words are God\u2019s words.\nDoes Jesus agree? Yes! One time Jesus quoted a passage from the book of Psalms. After he did, he made a parenthetical, yet important, remark: \u201cThe Scripture cannot be broken\u201d (John 10:35). He was saying, \u201cThese words are God\u2019s words.\u201d\nThe New Testament makes the same claim. One example is found in 1 Thessalonians: \u201cWhen you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men, but as it actually is, the word of God\u201d (1 Thessalonians 2:13). Again, these words are God\u2019s words.\nAnd yet God in mercy chose to work through human writers, more than 35 of them. God used people like Moses, Isaiah, Luke, John, and Paul to write down his words, to be his secretaries, and indeed their personality/talents shine through. For example, Luke was a physician. In his books, we see lots of details, as you might expect from a physician. Paul was a learned man, so the books he wrote are often quite deep, even a bit more difficult to understand.\nTo summarize, God gave the Bible through human writers; we can learn a few things about them by reading their books. Yet they remained merely the secretaries. The words, finally, are God\u2019s."}
{"prompt": "Nephilim", "completion": "Who were the nephilim mentioned in Genesis 6:1-4? Were they offspring of fallen angels or fallen human children of God? And how did the Nephilim survive the Flood?\n\n\nThese verses have generated more than their share of imaginative interpretations and have become a breeding ground for fantastic speculation. Thanks for allowing us to review options and offer comments.\nMore Bizarre but Less Likely Option\nThe less plausible yet persistently popular idea is that Genesis 6 is talking about fallen angels (\u201csons of God\u201d) who impregnated select beautiful women (\u201cdaughters of men\u201d) and the demon-human offspring (\u201cthe Nephilim\u201d) were giants in stature and accomplishment prior to the Flood. Since Nephilim are spoken of after the Flood (Numbers 13:33), this race of giants somehow survived the Flood (or was restarted by another, post-Flood, demonic invasion with sexual unions with humans).\nThis scenario, of course, is exciting stuff that grabs people\u2019s attention. Superhuman giants! Hybrid creatures! And, stated honestly, it is grammatically and linguistically possible to arrive at this conclusion through a reading of Genesis 6:1-4. To say this view is utterly impossible or flagrantly contrary to Scripture is perhaps an overstatement.\nLess Bizarre and More Likely Option\nThe less exotic understanding of this section, but one more compatible with everything else revealed in the Bible, is this: Male descendents of Adam and Eve through Seth (the dominant line of believers, \u201csons of God\u201d) intermarried with attractive female descendents of Cain (the dominant line of unbelievers, \u201cdaughters of men\u201d) resulting not only in a deterioration of religious principle, but also in aggressive children who became strong in activity and reputation (\u201cthe Nephilim\u201d).\nThe term Nephilim is most likely derived from the Hebrew nphl (\u201cto fall\u201d or \u201cfall upon\u201d) and refers to \u201cfallen\u201d people (unbelieving rebels against God) or aggressive bullies who \u201cfall on\u201d others (overpowering and tyrannizing them). Nephilim might also derive from the root pl\u2019 (\u201cto be awesome, full of wonder\u201d), and the title then stresses they were people who were strong in physical stature, accomplishment, and reputation \u2013 including (if ancient traditions are considered) bullying others as gangsters or mobsters.\nThese early Nephilim perished in the Flood (Genesis 7:21), but other giants in stature developed in later generations and family branches of mankind. The term Nephilim need not refer to a specific race or tribe, but to people who bore the same general characteristics. Included among them were the Anakim, Rephaim, and Emim mentioned in Numbers 13:33, Deuteronomy 3:11, and 2:10. The Philistine warrior Goliath is probably the best known example of an aggressive giant (1 Samuel 17:4), but there is evidence that people of exceptional size lived in various parts of the world through most of history.\nThe Preferable Option\nOne could argue that both options outlined above are possible and the relatively obscure references in Genesis 6 should lead us to advocate no preference between them. One reason we list the second scenario as more plausible is that the idea of angels being capable of, interested in, or allowed by God to impregnate humans is simply foreign to the rest of Scripture. The words of Jesus in Mark 12:24-25 lead us to conclude that angels are not sexual beings the same way humans are. Notions of angel/human hybrids stem from later, non-biblical sources.\nThere\u2019s a second reason we may prefer the view about believers compromising religious principle through bad choices (including selection of spouses) that often results in ethically challenged progeny. This reason is more theological than textual or exegetical. It fits the pattern so often warned against yet so often repeated in subsequent generations of mankind. This way of deriving the meaning of a text is not adequate in and of itself \u2013 but when the conclusion is fully compatible with everything else the Bible says on a given subject, it may be seen as preferable."}
{"prompt": "Believing the whole Bible", "completion": "Do I have to believe the whole Bible?\n\n\nYour chest feels as if an elephant is dancing on it. You\u2019re gasping for air. Sweat is glistening on your face. You are in the emergency room of a hospital. Nurses are hooking wires all over your chest. Another nurse is searching for a vein to start an I.V. Another nurse is putting a small pill under your tongue. After looking at the monitor and the EKG tape, the doctor informs you that you are having a heart attack. It\u2019s a frightening scene. Other tests prove that there is a blockage in your heart. The doctor tells you what has happened to your heart and then proceeds to explain what needs to be done to repair your heart so that you can continue to live.\nAre you going to believe everything he says? Or are you going to pick and choose what you want to believe and disregard the rest, which could cost you your life? Your life depends on believing everything the doctor tells you.\nThere are people who believe the whole of the Bible. There are people who don\u2019t believe anything in the Bible. But how can a person believe just some of the Bible? How does a person pick and choose what parts of the Bible are true and what parts are not true? How can a person believe that Jesus died on the cross to take the sins of the world away and yet not believe that Jesus rose from the dead? How can a person believe that Jesus did miracles, but that Jonah could not have spent three days in the belly of a great fish?\nWhat is true and what is not true? The Bible is God\u2019s Word. Not believing some of the Bible will lead to doubting all the Bible. The Bible is not a collection of human ideas and thoughts. The Bible is God\u2019s Word, given word for word by the Holy Spirit to human writers. If any part of the Bible is merely human thoughts, and not God\u2019s Word, then all of God\u2019s Word can\u2019t be trusted. If it is God\u2019s Word, then all of it is true and is to be believed.\nWe believe the entire Bible is God\u2019s Word and it is true. Our belief is not founded on shaky ground. First, there is more evidence for the documents of the Bible than for any other ancient book. Second, all the writers of the New Testament wrote within the first century of Christ\u2019s birth. They all knew Jesus. Third, even historical facts cited by the writers have been proven to be true. Fourth, God promised that the writers would tell the truth. The Holy Spirit guided them so that they did just that.\nWe believe all of the Bible because in it God tells us that he loves us sinful human beings so very much that he sent His Son Jesus to live, suffer, die and rise for us so that we could be with him in heaven. That is why God tells us that his words \u201care written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name\u201d (John 20:31).\nGod\u2019s Word is all true. You can trust every word of it from beginning to end."}

Is it a matter of the parents holding to a belief that runs contrary to their church? If that is the case, they will want to be part of a church that teaches the truths of God\u2019s word, including baptism, and which is consistent with their faith. Jesus instructed us to baptize and teach people \u201cto obey everything I have commanded you\u201d (Matthew 28:20).

{"prompt": "Gambling", "completion": "Is gambling always sinful? What about gambling as entertainment when safeguards are in place?\n\n\nWhen asking your question you clarified that you do gamble but limit the frequency of the activity, limit the amount of money put at risk, and maintain fiscal responsibility in your giving to the Lord. You want to view gambling as an acceptable form of entertainment that offers at least relatively harmless excitement, but you are really not sure if this is right.\nSince gambling has become so pervasive in our culture, Christians increasingly wrestle with questions like yours. It\u2019s a question that won\u2019t go away.\nAlways sinful? No.\nThe main reason we don\u2019t classify gambling as sin is that we don\u2019t have the right to label something sinful if the Bible doesn\u2019t. Gambling was well known in Bible times and a widespread obsession in ancient Rome, yet God\u2019s Word contains no prohibition of the practice.\nA second factor is that there is no universal definition of what gambling is. To make a sweeping statement that \u201cgambling is wrong\u201d could condemn all risk taking and games of chance that conceivably would include investing in the stock market, involvement in the insurance industry, or playing penny-ante parlor games.\nOften sinful? Yes.\nHistorically Christianity has strongly opposed most gambling practices because they are hard to reconcile with timeless biblical principles for God-pleasing lifestyles. Here\u2019s a partial list of issues that surface when gambling is considered:\n\nThe Bible condemns and warns against greed, the love of money, and \u201cget rich quick\u201d mindsets (Colossians 3:5; 1 Timothy 6:10; Proverbs 13:11; Ecclesiastes 5:10). These attitudes often accompany gambling, and temptations to sin quickly surface in that environment.\nThe Bible repeatedly calls us to love our neighbor as ourselves (as in Romans 13:9,10), yet most forms of gambling invite us to get something at the expense of those who must ultimately lose. Even when my neighbor seems willing to lose what he has, should I seek to take advantage of that?\nRomans 14:19-21 instructs us\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to avoid the use of otherwise\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 permissible activities when we\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 might lead others to sin or harm another\u2019s faith. Isn\u2019t this worth thinking about in our country where there are an estimated 8 million pathological and problem gamblers and where 60 percent of adults have gambled within the past year? Do we ultimately feed an industry that preys on so many?\nWe are called to be faithful stewards, or managers, of all God\u2019s blessings all the time (Psalm 24:1; 2 Corinthians 5:14,15; Luke 12:35-48). While gambling is only one in a long list of potential time and money wasters, the question needs to be asked: Is this a wise use of resources God has given, even when moderation is shown? Do we fail to support our churches and yet spend money on gambling?\n\nPersonally sinful? Yes or no.\nAfter identifying pertinent issues and inviting self-examination, we entrust the matter to the conscience of the individual brother or sister, who is called to apply the Bible principles in his or her own life. Generally speaking, churches used to condemn gambling more quickly and comprehensively than they do now. Such is the power of culture. For the conscientious believer, however, the internal struggle to know and do what is wise, loving, and beneficial will continue. Your question is evidence of that.\nSometimes Christians might apply one principle somewhat differently than others. Let\u2019s be quick to listen to their explanation and loving when we offer input. What we really want most is that believers grow spiritually and seek to do what shows love for their neighbor and respect for our gracious Lord."}
{"prompt": "Taking anxiety medication", "completion": "I was recently diagnosed with a general anxiety disorder. My doctor says I have a chemical imbalance in my brain and prescribed anxiety drugs, but so far I have refused to take them. I feel that my faith is very weak for giving into these fears and anxieties. What does God say about the use of these drugs?\n\n\nGod\u2019s Word does not speak directly to the topic of taking medication to alleviate anxiety. What it does do, however, is speak in terms of \u201cprinciples\u201d that guide in making such decisions about medication. Applicable principles would be to love God (Matthew 22:37-38) and to love others (Matthew 22:39). If your anxiety interferes with your ability to demonstrate love for God and for others it is commendable to find a solution.\nWe are also to be mindful that we are stewards over our own bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19) so you would want to only do things that help and not hurt your body. As such we are to care for our bodies, which requires eating the right foods, drinking the right fluids, and even taking the right medicines.\nWhile we might be tempted to think that by taking medicine we are failing to exercise trust in God, there is a different way to look at it. One of your greatest blessings is God\u2019s gift of life. It is a blessing entrusted to each of us to care for in a manner that glorifies God (1 Corinthians 10:31). Sometimes such care is as benign as bandaging a small physical wound, dressing warmly on a cool day, or walking in the fresh air and sunlight. Sometimes being a good steward of our bodies involves consenting to major surgery or taking medication to help us heal and feel better.\nIn a world of sin there is no avoiding its consequences. Bodies are imperfect. They are frail and vulnerable. In our imperfection we provide the best care we can. We never do this apart from God\u2019s providence. We trust in his promise to work all things for our good. We trust that the effectiveness of our actions is still subject to God\u2019s will for our lives.\nSo, on the one hand you repair wounds and take medicine as a responsible steward of God\u2019s blessing of life. On the other hand, you do such things trusting in his love, his promises, and his providence.\nFinally, always desire to grow in faith but never forget to celebrate the faith that you already have. Your faith has you turning to fellow Christians via this Web site to seek out God\u2019s counsel and direction. For now God\u2019s response to your concerns is not what you expected or wanted, but you know he is the one who has the answers. Even if, for a time, you must suffer, lean on your faith which instructs you that there is a purpose, even in the hardship (2 Corinthians 12:7-10).\nTaking anti-anxiety medication is one way you care for your body. Celebrate God\u2019s blessing of medicine that assists you in this act of stewardship and service to him and rejoice in your faith, which holds you in his arms."}
{"prompt": "Always forgiving others", "completion": "Should we forgive others for all sins they may commit against us? If they show no remorse or repentance, are we still to offer our forgiveness? \n\n\nThe topic of forgiveness is prominent in Scripture. Thanks for highlighting this subject with your question.\nForgive fully and unconditionally\nA number of passages indicate we are to forgive unconditionally, whether or not others express repentance, show remorse, or offer any apology. Please read these thoughtfully. Matthew 6:14,15 instructs us to forgive human beings with no explicit mention whether or not they are believers or are repentant. Mark 11:25 and Luke 11:4 call us to pardon \u201canyone\u201d and \u201ceveryone\u201d without distinction. Seeking pardon for his crucifiers, Jesus mentioned their lack of comprehension (Luke 23:34), but contrition or regret are not in the picture. The Fifth Petition of the Lord\u2019s Prayer likewise provides no explicit or implicit condition of repentance linked to pardoning our debtors. We have ample evidence to say believers are to forgive fully, unconditionally.\nI suspect your question may stem from passages that focus on our forgiving fellow believers who express repentance. Luke 17:4 as well as Christ\u2019s powerful parable in Matthew 18:21-35 explicitly address forgiveness among Christians. Contrition and repentance always play a role here. You might also be thinking of our high privilege to forgive or not forgive sinners in administering \u201cthe keys\u201d in ways that reflect prior repentance or impenitence (see Matthew 18:15-20; John 20:21-23). This tells us much about how we are to communicate with fellow sinners as God\u2019s representatives on earth, but nothing removes from us the sacred, personal obligation to forgive unconditionally.\nCommunicate forgiveness wisely and lovingly\nOur culture makes a big deal about victims forgiving criminals who wronged them. Remorse is sought from the guilty, and when those victimized express forgiveness, they are praised. The greater needs of the guilty, namely, godly repentance and divine forgiveness, are typically ignored. That\u2019s a shame. It\u2019s wonderful when sinners forgive other sinners, but God\u2019s forgiving sinners is far greater. This is the message we are fully qualified to share with the world. So as we forgive others personally and unconditionally, we do well to think about how we communicate this to those who sin against us.\nHow might we offer clarifications as we affirm our full forgiveness to others? Especially to those who have wronged us yet have given no evidence of contrition before God or reliance on Jesus as their sin-bearer, we may say:\nI fully and freely forgive you, sinner to sinner. I hold no grudge against you, seek no retaliation, and will keep no record of wrongs. I have no desire or need for this. My Lord Jesus is my ultimate Protector, and he will satisfy justice in the end. Vengeance is his to give, not mine.\nBut please understand that this actually may mean very little for your long-term well-being. If and as long as you do not repent before God of your sin, you do not enjoy the forgiveness Christ earned for you. You forfeit personal benefit of his pardon. You have my forgiveness, given cheerfully in love. But just like me, a sinner like you, you need the personal enjoyment of Christ\u2019s forgiveness, which is also freely given. I am willing to do anything I can to help you enjoy this.\nOur responsibility is to forgive others fully, unconditionally. As we communicate this, let us also speak wisely as well as lovingly so that we will best serve our neighbor."}
{"prompt": "Girl Scouts", "completion": "Are WELS girls able to participate in the Girl Scout program as it currently stands as an organization? Please give doctrinal position. Thank you.\n\n\nThe Girl Scouts organization is not an option for WELS girls as long as the Girl Scouts\u2019 Promise and Law are the foundation of the organization.\u00a0 The website of the Girl Scouts currently states:\u00a0 \u201cEverything in Girl Scouting is based on the Girl Scout Promise and Law.\u00a0 The Girl Scout Law includes many of the principles and values common to most faiths.\u00a0 Thus, while a secular organization, Girl Scouts has, since the movement began, encouraged girls to take spiritual journeys via their faiths\u2019 religious recognitions.\u201d\nAs the Girl Scouts organization allows members to define \u201cGod\u201d however they want, it is a group that puts all religions on equal footing and maintains that girls are able to do their duty to the God of their understanding.\nThis now becomes a first commandment issue (Exodus 20:3; Deuteronomy 5:7).\u00a0 There is only one God:\u00a0 the God of the Bible who has revealed himself as Father, Son and Holy Spirit.\u00a0 There is only one Savior, Jesus Christ (John 14:6).\u00a0 Only Christians are able to do things that are pleasing to God (John 15:5; Romans 14:23).\u00a0 We will want to belong to organizations that give clear testimony to the truths of the Bible.\u00a0 Scouting is not one of those organizations.\u00a0 The Lutheran Girl Pioneers program, of course, is one in which we can encourage WELS girls to participate."}
{"prompt": "Drinking alcohol", "completion": "Is is sinful to drink alcohol?\n\n\nAn appropriate starting place is to allow Scripture to determine whether drinking alcoholic beverages is a sin or if it is something neither commanded nor forbidden, that is, a matter of Christian freedom.\nThis particular point is not difficult to determine. There is no prohibition in the Bible that declares drinking a sin in and of itself. It would be spiritual arrogance and rank legalism to declare something sinful when the Bible has not done so. And there are quite a few passages that speak of a proper and pleasing use of alcoholic beverages. Whether it be general passages like Proverbs 9:1-5, or Isaiah 55:1, or examples like Christ\u2019s miracle in Cana (John 2:1-11), or Christ\u2019s use of wine in the Last Supper and while instituting the Lord\u2019s Supper, or Paul\u2019s fatherly advice to Timothy (1 Timothy 5:23), the legitimate and proper use of alcoholic drinks is clearly established. It is a matter of Christian freedom, and we have no right to bind another\u2019s conscience on this point.\nIt is precisely because it is a matter of Christian freedom, neither right nor wrong in itself, that Paul\u2019s words in Romans 14 and 1 Corinthians 8 come into the picture here. The freedom to drink wine, for example, implies the freedom to refrain from doing so when it best serves our Christian purposes. In all matters of Christian freedom we need to ask if our doing something (or not doing something) is wise and beneficial, or potentially a cause for a weaker brother or sister to stumble spiritually (that is, to spiritually \u201coffend\u201d another believer). It may also become a point of Christian confession, something that needs to be done or not done to establish or testify to the truth of Scripture."}
{"prompt": "Boy Scouts", "completion": "What is the WELS stance on joining Boy Scouts and why?\n\n\nThe Boy Scouts are among the most respected organizations in this country, and the skills, activities, and companionship which they offer could be a benefit to any child. Yet for more than 70 years the Wisconsin Synod has warned its members that their children should not participate in the Scouting program.\nOur basic objection to Scouting was that the required promise and law contain religious elements which imply that the Scout can do his duty to God regardless of what religion he belongs to. This contradicts the clear statements of Scripture that no one can perform works pleasing to God without faith in Christ.\nOver the years the wording of the Scout Law and its explanation have become vaguer and less offensive, but the religious principles have been maintained. All members of the Scouts must accept the Scout Oath and Law, but they may interpret them in their own way. For example, an atheist boy who refused to promise to do his duty to God was denied membership, but when he took the oath with the understanding that \u201cgod\u201d was not a personal being, he was permitted to join. This is certainly a very offensive interpretation of the concept of \u201cduty to God.\u201d\nRecognition of the religious basis of Scouting is not limited to the WELS. Advocates of strong separation of church and state have objected to the promotion of Scouting in public schools because of its religious requirements.\nBecause the religious requirements of Scouting remain unchanged, our WELS congregations cannot make use of the Scouting organizations. We have a better option in the Lutheran Pioneers, which provide many of the same benefits as Scouting, without the objectionable religious requirements.\nThe religious principles of Scouting remain unchanged, but there has been one notable development. The increased vagueness of the Scouting literature and the fact that some Scout troops may make little use of the religious features make it more difficult for pastors and teachers to convincingly demonstrate from the Scout Handbook the false religious principles which underlie Scouting. This makes it more difficult to convince parents that their children should not belong to the Scouts. The Girl Scouts are a separate organization, but the same principles and observations apply to that group also."}
{"prompt": "Critical and unforgiving people", "completion": "What happens on judgment day to a believer who constantly criticizes others, blames everyone else for his problems, and refuses to forgive others by always bringing up their past wrongdoing? \n\n\nI cannot say definitively what will happen on the Last Day to this constantly critical person because I cannot look into his heart. He may be a weak or immature believer reminiscent of the Corinthians with their habitually bad behavior (see 1 Corinthians 1:11; 3:1-3). Or he may be an unbeliever whose profession of faith is empty. But I can say that we all have to deal with critical people, even in the church, and important issues need to be identified and addressed whenever that happens.\nI appreciate the fact that you are asking the question and expressing concern. It is not normal for believers to be so characteristically or chronically critical of others. We should not ignore, much less excuse, such behavior or take it lightly.\nTAKE THIS SERIOUSLY\nYou describe a faultfinding lifestyle trait. This is disturbing. All of us have bad moments, are subject to bad moods, and can be critical at times. But the Bible describes a child of God as one whose dominant lifestyle is governed by the new man rather than the old. We\u2019re not talking about ethical perfection, but we are talking about a discernible habitual pattern of godly attitudes and actions, fueled and maintained by the Holy Spirit through the gospel. Constant depreciation of others and an unforgiving attitude are not compatible with true faith (as James 3:9-12 and Matthew 18:21-35 illustrate well). So we take this situation seriously.\nEven if faith remains, denigrating others is not living a life \u201cworthy of the calling [we] have received\u201d (Ephesians 4:1). There may well be serious psychological and social issues to be addressed. Most often, as the old adage says, \u201churting people hurt people.\u201d Low self-esteem and insecurity are frequently involved, and miserable people tend to prefer\u2014or seek to create\u2014miserable companions. Even if it\u2019s more of a superficial matter of lacking social skills like diplomacy and tact, this is serious stuff for the Christian community, since we represent our Lord when we interact with others.\nTAKE TIME TO SERVE\nWe are to be agents of change not just identifiers of bad behavior. I am to speak straightforwardly with the critic, confront unacceptable speech, and hold professing believers in particular to biblical norms. Our Lord\u2019s clear counsel in Matthew 18:15-20 applies to this kind of situation as it does with any other departure from the command to \u201clove your neighbor as yourself.\u201d Within the church this always involves a compassionate use of law and gospel to expose sin and underscore the grace of God for sinners. Enlist the help of fellow believers who know the person and his behavior patterns. The primary goal is to serve the person\u2019s spiritual as well as emotional needs. A companion blessing of serving the critic\u2019s needs is that it keeps us from growing bitter or becoming enablers of bad behavior through silence.\nBe patient in your loving testimony to the critic. Change may not be apparent overnight. Ingrained behavior patterns are notoriously difficult to amend even if the person is repentant and growing spiritually. Expect fruits of faith, but be realistic in your expectations as you entrust the person to God\u2019s Word and Spirit, and continue your testimony to him and intercessions to God on his behalf."}
{"prompt": "Justifiable anger", "completion": "What is considered justifiable anger? When sin is involved, is justifiable anger only reserved for positions in authority? Can you please give me Scripture to reference? For example, when a child is abused by their parent, is their anger justified?\n\n\nThe Bible does not label all anger as being sinful.\u00a0 Jesus had justifiable or righteous anger when synagogue worshipers refused to answer his question whether or not it was lawful to do good on the Sabbath day by healing an individual (Mark 3:1-6) and when he cleansed the temple courts of money changers and merchandisers (John 2:15-17; Mark 11:15-16).\nChristians too, not just those in authority, can have righteous anger when others set aside God\u2019s commands:\u00a0 when they hurt and abuse others, when they mock God and his word, when they sin.\nGod\u2019s concern though is that a person\u2019s righteous anger might turn into sinful anger, so he says:\u00a0 \u201cIn your anger do not sin.\u00a0 Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry\u2026Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger\u2026\u201d (Psalm 4:4; Ephesians 4:26, 31).\u00a0 As sinful human beings, our anger over other people\u2019s sins might lead us to seek revenge, get even or wish evil on them.\u00a0 God expressly forbids those thoughts, emotions and actions (Romans 12:17-21; 1 Peter 3:9).\nThe bottom line is that we can walk a fine line with anger.\u00a0 The sins of others might rightly arouse our anger.\u00a0 We can express our displeasure of and concern for people\u2019s sins.\u00a0 We might even seek justice.\u00a0 We will pray that those who have angered us will confess their sins and then enjoy God\u2019s forgiveness of sins through faith in Jesus Christ.\u00a0 Ultimately we leave matters in the hands of God."}
{"prompt": "Giving up everything for Jesus", "completion": "Jesus gave up EVERYTHING for us. Jesus also asked his disciples to give up EVERYTHING, even their families and they did. What does that mean for those that are \"believers\" that don't give EVERYTHING? Jesus himself said, for those that don't give EVERYTHING cannot be my disciple.

{"prompt": "Women attending voters' meetings", "completion": "Is it OK for women to attend the voters' meeting, as long as they do not take the floor? I have read over and over 1Timothy 2:11-15, and have read Genesis 3:16.

{"prompt": "Ashes on forehead", "completion": "What is the purpose of putting ashes on the forehead of Christians on Ash Wednesday? This is showy to me and very \"Catholic\" (where Catholics believe \"good works\" are essential for salvation) and can give the wrong message to unbelievers. I look at it as a distraction and unnecessary. During the time of Lent, I dearly love the focus on what Christ has done for me and all people by his death and resurrection while we were still sinners. (Romans 5:8) (John 3:16-17) Thank you. \n\n\nThe purpose is to have a visual reminder that the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23), and death means our bodies return to dust from which Adam was made (Genesis 3:19).\u00a0 As ashes are biblical pictures of repentance (Job 42:6; Matthew 11:21), the use of ashes eventually became associated with Lent, a penitential season of the church year.\nAs a church custom, the imposition of ashes (as it is called) is an adiaphoron.\u00a0 God has not commanded it nor forbidden it.\u00a0 In Christian freedom, we may utilize the practice or forego it.\u00a0 If our conscience leads us to conclude that it would be wrong for us to participate in that custom, we need to refrain from taking part in it.\u00a0 At the same time, we need to withhold judgment from those who participate in the practice for good and godly reasons.\u00a0 Romans 14 and 1 Corinthians 8 address how Christians are to view adiaphora.\nThe custom of putting ashes on the foreheads of Christians on Ash Wednesday has been in use for centuries.\u00a0 While it is a practice that many still associate only with Roman Catholicism, it has grown in popularity with Protestant churches in recent years.\nYour concern for the Lenten focus on Christ is well taken.\u00a0 Those Protestants, including Lutherans, who endorse the practice would point out that ashes are put in the shape of a cross on the foreheads of worshipers.\u00a0 The visual emphasis, then, is on the cross of Christ.\nRegardless of people\u2019s views on this custom, there is no getting around the \u201cash\u201d of Ash Wednesday, is there?\u00a0 Whether or not we implement that custom in our congregations, the terminology of the day reminds us of our natural and actual sinfulness, and the need to repent of our sins.\u00a0 More than that, the season of Lent reveals clearly the love of Christ, who sacrificed himself to take away our sins.\u00a0 God bless your Lenten worship."}
{"prompt": "Funerals for non-believers", "completion": "Are there scriptural verses or examples that are the basis for not (generally speaking) doing funerals for non-believers and/or former members, besides Jesus saying \"Let the dead bury their own dead.\"\n\n\nThe most pertinent passages would be those that are clustered about the so-called Great Commission (for example, Matthew 28:18-20, Mark 16:15-16, and Luke 24:46-47). Also very applicable are all passages calling us to love God and our neighbor (Matthew 22:37-39, Romans Romans 13:8-10).\nAssuming that the calling body has not spoken on this issue to forbid or encourage its pastor to officiate at funeral services of publicly identified unbelievers or non-members of the congregation, the pastor must ask a primary set of questions like these: \u201cWhat am I doing here? What is my purpose or goal, and is this compatible with the faithful preaching of law and gospel to serve the souls of the survivors and onlookers? How will I glorify God and enrich souls here, and how might these purposes be jeopardized?\u201d\nFor the funeral service of an unbeliever there is no comfort whatsoever we can offer. Faithful preaching of law and gospel to the loved ones of the deceased will most likely antagonize and bring anger rather than joy regarding the loved one who died. The temptation to compromise by neglecting pointed law and remaining silent on the damnable nature of unrepented sin is great, and to do so is ultimately loveless and reprehensible for a servant of the gospel and of souls. Merely to preach the gospel (narrowly defined) without the clear application of law is also unacceptable and invites false assumptions among the audience plus rationalizations about the fate of the deceased.\nFor the funeral of a non-member or former member, I\u2019d have to know more about the circumstances as well as the spiritual condition of the deceased before I say much. Sample questions that may surface include these: Why would a pastor seek to serve a non-member, assuming the non-member has another pastor to serve? If there was no church membership anywhere, why was there such a public confession \u2013 a\u00a0presumed neglect of the public use of the means of grace and Christian fellowship? What basis is there to assume the non-member had a meaningful confession of saving faith? Etc.\nAlso involved in this matter is the call to serve as spiritual shepherd of a flock. Pastors do not have calls to serve as pastors of a community or straying sheep in general. But there may be circumstances when we not only serve them but do well to publicly testify to their spiritual life in Christ \u2014 based on a private confession of faith known to the pastor \u2014 and explain straightforwardly why we are conducting the funeral service of a non-member in a God-glorifying way that will edify souls."}
{"prompt": "WELS' call process", "completion": "Could you explain to me how the call process for pastors and teachers works in WELS? Our pastor, whom we all love, currently has a call to another congregation, and of course we don't want to see him leave.\n\n\nYou are by no means the first church member who has had these kinds of thoughts. We are extremely grateful that you love your pastor and that the thought of losing him is emotionally unpleasant. No doubt it is equally and perhaps more unpleasant for the church that currently has no pastor and that has extended a call to your pastor to consider serving them at this time in his pastoral career.\nProcedurally, the Bible does not give detailed instructions about how churches are to obtain their pastors, teachers, or staff ministers. The procedures that have been developed within our synod (and in many other church bodies as well) have served us well over the years and are an orderly and suitable way of going about filling public ministry positions that are vacant. I say this lest we give the impression that our way is the only way of doing this. But it is a good way, and you may be sure that other ways have been considered and minor changes to the way we do things have been implemented over the years.\nBriefly stated, we entrust the task of filling vacancies among us to the 12 district presidents in our synod. Their task is to be familiar with the congregations and schools in their respective districts, so they know the challenges and opportunities that exist at a given place, and the desires and expectations of the calling group. They also have and keep informational records on all eligible called workers (pastors, teachers, staff ministers) so they have a good idea of the strengths and weaknesses, skills and aptitudes of these trained public ministers. And they provide a list of suitable people for the calling church or organization to consider as they strive to fill their vacancy. In the case of your pastor, then, his background, skills, experience, etc., were seen as a suitable match for the vacant church; his name was placed on such a list by a district president; and the vacant church selected him from that list and extended a call to him. He must now prayerfully determine whether he can best serve where he currently is or at the other place at this particular time. And he will likely be receiving counsel and input from a variety of sources as he considered his two calls (the one, to his current parish and the other, to\u00a0his potential future parish).\nThe task of assigning graduates from our seminary and college (pastoral, teacher, and staff ministry candidates) to their initial place of labor is also entrusted to the Conference of Presidents (COP) composed of the 12 district presidents in our synod. They receive help and guidance from school officers and administrators who serve to give them a good portrait of the strengths, weaknesses, and skills of the candidates. The district presidents then\u00a0seek to assign the candidates to fitting churches and schools that provide a good match for their skills and aptitudes.\nBut remember that many churches and schools, because of their size and other circumstances, may not be a suitable place for an inexperienced worker to be assigned. So it\u2019s not as simple as assigning graduates to any vacant place. Many places, due to their situation, need or desire an experienced pastor \u2014 like yours. So they extend a call to him even though there may be graduates available.\nWe are very much aware that many times a degree of turmoil and discomfort accompanies this process. At the same time, there is value in having churches, schools, pastors, and teachers undertake the self-appraisal and the thorough look at how the public ministry at a given place is going. There are definite blessings that come with the discomfort.\nEvery step of the way in this process we give mutual encouragement that we approach this important task prayerfully and with the confidence that the Holy Spirit will be guiding the district presidents, the churches and schools who are seeking workers, and the churches and schools who may eventually lose a beloved called worker if he or she accepts a call to another place. This is our prayer and confidence regarding your church and pastor as well."}

But I myself have experienced unexplained events in familiar surroundings that make me question whether there are ghosts or not. How do I answer those who ask me whether I believe in ghosts?\n\n\nWhen a person dies, the body and soul are separated and there is immediate judgment by God (Ecclesiastes 12:7; Hebrews 9:27).\u00a0 The lifeless body remains on the earth, while the soul is in heaven or hell (Luke 16:19-31).\u00a0 That last Scripture reference informs us that souls do not leave heaven or hell.\u00a0 Those who have died do not return to this world as ghosts.\nStill, what might explain unusual events in this world?\u00a0 We do know that Satan and evil spirits or demons roam the earth (Job 2:2; Matthew 12:43-45; 1 Peter 5:8).\u00a0 Satan\u2019s powers exceed our own natural powers (Ephesians 6:12).\u00a0 Satan uses his powers to lie and try to rob people of spiritual and eternal life (John 8:44).\u00a0 We can attribute paranormal experiences to Satan.\nThankfully for us, Satan is a defeated enemy.\u00a0 Through his redeeming work, Jesus crushed his head (Genesis 3:15).\u00a0 It is a matter of time before Satan is put out of commission entirely (Revelation 20:7-10).\u00a0 Until that time, we arm ourselves for battle against Satan (Ephesians 6:16), and know that we have the upper hand because of the Lord\u2019s power and promises (James 4:7).\u00a0 Hopefully with information like this, you can address your own questions and the questions of others."}
{"prompt": "Life support and brain dead", "completion": "If a person is on ventilators, but brain dead, is their soul still in their body?\n\n\nYour question underscores the benefits and challenges, in this case, that advancements in medical technology have given us.\u00a0 Allow me to pass along information that Rev. Robert Fleischmann, National Director of Christian Life Resources, shared with me on the subject:\nThere is considerable disagreement in society about \u201cwhat is death.\u201d\u00a0 A diagnosis of \u201cbrain dead\u201d used to mean the complete cessation of all measurable activity in the cerebral cortex and the brain stem.\u00a0 Failure in both of those areas of the brain causes the lungs to stop processing air, the heart to stop pumping blood and, without a circulation of oxygen throughout the body, there is death.\nWhat has happened, however, is that defining death has become more a process of measuring quality of life.\u00a0 Patients deemed to be in a \u201cpersistent vegetative state\u201d (PVS) are often called \u201cbrain dead\u201d but, in actuality, while showing minimal or no activity in the cerebral cortex, their brain stem is functioning, the lungs are processing air and the heart is migrating that air throughout the blood by means of the blood system.\u00a0 A recent study has demonstrated that PVS patients actually show awareness of their surroundings but are unable to respond.\nSome people are moving quickly to a purely quality of life measurement.\u00a0 Maladies like dementia, Alzheimer\u2019s or trauma to the brain which reduce its activity is interpreted by some to be \u201cessentially dead\u201d because of the declined quality of life.\nScripture tells us that God breathed life into the first man (Genesis 2:7) and that breathing (the process of taking in oxygen) is life (Job 33:4; Ezekiel 37:5; Acts 17:25).\u00a0 Elsewhere Scripture instructs us that death comes with the last breath \u2013 the removal of life-sustaining oxygen (Genesis 25:8; 1 Kings 17:17-18; Mark 15:37; Luke 23:46).\nSome object to ventilator support because it is \u201cartificial.\u201d\u00a0 Yet, we use all sorts of artificial equipment and medicine to help us breath better, take in more oxygen and be healthy.\nBiologically, death is present when the body as a whole no longer takes in and processes oxygen.\u00a0 Close encounters with death always involve the interruption of oxygen to a portion of the body.\u00a0 With a stroke, a clot cuts off oxygen-rich blood to portions of the brain.\u00a0 With a heart attack, a chamber of the heart stalls in its task of cycling oxygen-rich blood throughout the body.\u00a0 With cancer, we see infected cells that no longer transport and process oxygen.\u00a0 That is why the death of Christ was confirmed with the spear stab to the abdomen.\u00a0 The outpouring of blood and water provided evidence that the body was no longer circulating blood and that it had begun to settle in the lower parts of the anatomy (John 19:34).\u00a0 Other organs had also failed.\nFinal death comes when all of this is irreversible.\u00a0 Through the blessing of technology God has permitted\u00a0 us to more closely observe near death and death.\u00a0 That same technology is often God\u2019s instrument of protecting and prolonging life.\nIn summary, if there truly was brain death, the body would not be cycling and processing the oxygen received through the ventilator.\u00a0 The body would not be staying warm.\u00a0 There would be no measurement of activity in either the cerebral cortex or the brain stem.\nVentilator support is assistive in nature.\u00a0 It requires the \u201ccooperation\u201d of the other body organs to make bringing in oxygen effective.\u00a0 Death, therefore, becomes near not only with diminished brain activity, but you will see other indicators as well, such as failure of the kidneys, liver, pancreas and heart.\nSimply stated, life is the body taking in oxygen (an unborn child does this by getting all of her oxygen through the umbilical cord from the placenta) and disseminating it throughout the body.\u00a0 Death, therefore, would be the opposite.\u00a0 As the body dies, the absence of oxygen can be observed through the cascading effect of multiple organ failures.\u00a0 And when death takes place, the body and soul separate (Ecclesiastes 12:7; Luke 23:43, 46; Acts 7:59).\nYou will find more information on end of life issues on the Christian Life Resources website."}
{"prompt": "Cremation", "completion": "Is there any scriptural basis against cremation?\n\n\nScripture is silent on the issue of cremation.\u00a0 It is a matter of personal preference when it comes to burial or cremation.\u00a0 There was a time not that long ago when some voices in the Christian church cautioned against cremation.\u00a0 In a day and age when some unbelievers utilized cremation as a way to defy God (\u201cLet\u2019s see if this supposed God can put me back together some day.\u201d), some Christians advocated that followers of the Lord not cremate their bodies, so as not to be associated with unbelievers or an activity of unbelievers.\nThat type of taunting has largely disappeared, so Christians today who make use of cremation are not likely to be confused with unbelievers.\u00a0 The choice of cremation over burial often includes ecological, economical and convenience factors.\nIn the end, cremation essentially speeds up the process that occurs with burial:\u00a0 \u201cDust you are and to dust you will return\u201d (Genesis 3:19).\u00a0 And, regardless of cremation or burial, \u201cAll who are in their graves will hear his [Jesus\u2019] voice and come out\u201d (John 5:28-29).\u00a0 What a blessing to know and believe in \u201cthe resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting\u201d (The Apostles\u2019 Creed).\u00a0 God grant that same blessing to many more."}

It teaches that the whole New Testament era will be a time of tribulation for the church (Acts 14:22) with an intense period of tribulation at the end. The three and one-half years described repeatedly in Revelation (time, times, and half a time, forty-two months) is a figurative expression for the whole New Testament era. This is especially apparent in Revelation 12, where the three and one-half years begins with Christ\u2019s ascension and ends with his return.\nPeople who believe in dispensational premillennialism do allow others (especially the Jews) to have a second chance to be converted.\u00a0 That sounds like the view of your friend.\nYour friend needs to know that people have one time of grace, one time for God to bring them to a confession of sins and a confession of faith in Jesus Christ as Savior.\u00a0 When that time of grace ends at death or, if people are alive on the earth when Jesus returns visibly to this world, then there is immediate judgment (Hebrews 9:27; Matthew 25:31-46).\u00a0 There are no second chances.\u00a0 That is why Scripture repeatedly urges people to focus on their salvation now, today (2 Corinthians 6:2; Hebrews 3:12-4:7).\nBecause your question is associated with multiple false teachings regarding the end times, you would do well to read a good explanation of what the Bible teaches about the end of the world.\u00a0 Northwestern Publishing House recently published such a book.\u00a0 It is called \u201cEnd Times:\u00a0 Jesus is Coming Soon\u201d and is available on NPH\u2019s website.\nGod bless your witnessing efforts as you relay the truths of God\u2019s word to your friend."}

Thank you for your thoughtful response. \n\n\nWhen Christians are joined together in faith and doctrine, they are able to express their unity by joint prayer and worship, cooperative educational endeavors and shared outreach efforts (Acts 1:14; 2:42; Hebrews 10:24-25; Psalm 78:4-7; 3 John 5-8).\nWhen you and I interact with Christians whose faith differs from ours, we follow Scripture\u2019s instructions and do not engage in those previously mentioned activities (Romans 16:17; Titus 3:10; 2 John 10-11).\nBy not worshiping or praying together with other Christians, you and I are not intending to say that we do not consider such people to be outside the faith.\u00a0 God alone can see what is in the heart (1 Samuel 16:7).\u00a0 We readily and happily acknowledge that the kingdom of God is bigger than our synod.\u00a0 Refraining from prayer and worship with people who are not united with us in faith and doctrine is, as our Catechism points out from Scripture, a matter of showing love for the truth of God\u2019s word (2 Corinthians 13:8), love for our own souls (Galatians 5:9) and love for those who are mixing error with truth (James 5:19-20).\nI do not know to which churches your co-workers belong, but I imagine your faith could differ from theirs in such areas as:\u00a0 original sin, infant baptism, the real presence in the Lord\u2019s Supper, the converting work of the Holy Spirit, creation, the end times, and other items.\u00a0 Imagine if you were to pray a prayer that reflected your Spirit-worked conviction in these areas, and your co-workers believed something differently.\u00a0 They might not appreciate your prayer or add their \u201cAmen\u201d to it.\u00a0 That simply illustrates why there needs to be unity among Christians before they pray together.\nPraying with family members involves the same principles and application.\u00a0 Then again, you might be dealing with an exceptional situation in which family members belong to a church outside our fellowship, but they are not supportive of their church\u2019s false teachings.\u00a0 In fact, they recognize the errors of their church and are seeking to point others to the truth of God\u2019s word.\u00a0 In a situation like that, their confession of faith may match your confession of faith, and joint prayer in a private setting would not be a cause of offense to others.\u00a0 Exceptional situations like this are spelled out more fully in a book you might find valuable to read:\u00a0 Church Fellowship:\u00a0 Working Together for the Truth.\u00a0 It is available in hard copy or eBook format.\nStanding up for the truth of God\u2019s word and exercising fellowship principles is not always easy.\u00a0 God give you strength and joy to do that!"}
{"prompt": "Importance of membership", "completion": "All my life I have been a member of a congregation. Whenever I moved I changed my membership from my previous congregation to a congregation close to where I lived. There was never a question in my mind about whether I should. However, younger people ask me why it is important to be a member. If they attend regularly and hear God's Word, why should they become a member? How can I best answer them?\n\n\nHearing God\u2019s Word regularly is good and beneficial, and is what God instructs us to do (Hebrews 10:25).\u00a0 The Lord also invites and directs us to receive his holy Supper often (Matthew 26:26-29; Mark 14:22-25; Luke 22:17-20; 1 Corinthians 11: 23-25).\u00a0 Intensive instruction in the word equips individuals to examine themselves before receiving the sacrament (1 Corinthians 11:27-29).\u00a0 That instruction can lead to confirmation, and confirmation provides communicant membership in the congregation, which affords the privilege of receiving the Lord\u2019s Supper.\u00a0 When we understand the blessings the Lord wants to give us through his holy Supper, our new self will want to be a frequent and regular guest at the Supper.\u00a0 Church membership will then enable the reception of the Lord\u2019s Supper at other churches of our fellowship.\nIn addition to church membership opening the door for the reception of the Lord\u2019s Supper, think of the wording you might hear at the confirmation of an adult:\u00a0 \u201cWe invite you to participate with us in all the rights and privileges of this congregation.\u201d\u00a0 Membership in a local congregation enables people to participate more fully in the life of the congregation\u2014whether that is serving in positions of leadership, having a voice in the governance of the congregation, singing in choirs, or becoming involved in other activities that engage members in Christian service.\nUltimately, church membership is a tangible way of doing what Jesus said:\u00a0 \u201cacknowledging him before men\u201d (Matthew 10:32).\u00a0 In a day and age when people are tempted to view churches with a consumer mentality, your church membership is a wonderful testimony to the spirit of Christian devotion and dedication which the Lord has planted and nurtured in your heart.\u00a0 God bless you."}

Am I correct that he is omnibenevolent, and is there any particular Scripture that says it directly without question?\n\n\nYour question illustrates the challenge we humans have in understanding our immense God.\u00a0 We are very grateful that, beyond revealing himself through creation and our conscience, God has made himself known in his holy word.\u00a0 And yet that fuller revelation of himself in the Bible still leaves us with questions.\nIs God all-powerful?\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Is God all-knowing?\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Did God know that Satan and other angels would rebel against him, and that Adam and Eve would disobey his command?\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Could God have prevented both those \u201cfalls\u201d?\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Why did God allow sin and evil to enter his perfect creation?\u00a0 That last question leads me to turn to Romans 11:33-36:\u00a0 \u201cOh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!\u00a0 How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out!\u00a0 \u2018Who has known the mind of the Lord?\u00a0 Or who has been his counselor?\u2019\u00a0 \u2018Who has ever given to God, that God should repay him?\u2019\u00a0 For from him and through him and to him are all things.\u00a0 To him be the glory forever!\u00a0 Amen.\u201d\u00a0 You and I do not know what is in God\u2019s mind unless he tells us.\u00a0 What he does tell us is that, \u201cAs the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts\u201d (Isaiah 55:9).\u00a0 We really aren\u2019t to be surprised if we can\u2019t understand God completely.\nWhat we do know with certainty is that God met evil head-on at Calvary.\u00a0 The cross of Christ shows us God\u2019s power over sin and his compassionate love for a world lost in sin.\u00a0 At the cross of Christ God\u2019s justice and love intersect.\nYou ask if God desires good for every person.\u00a0 Most certainly.\u00a0 God does not want \u201canyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance\u201d (2 Peter 3:9).\u00a0 God \u201cwants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth\u201d (1 Timothy 2:4).\nAs you indicated in your reference to Joseph, God can take evil and turn it into good.\u00a0 Christians can say with the apostle Paul:\u00a0 \u201cAnd we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose\u201d (Romans 8:28).\nThe online essay file of Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary has many, many good papers written about the Bible and the Christian faith.\u00a0 One that I could recommend with your question in mind is The Hidden God.\u00a0 While it was written almost 100 years ago, it still has relevance.\u00a0 That\u2019s because it relays truths from a timeless Bible.\u00a0 God\u2019s blessings as you continue to speak to others about Scripture!"}
{"prompt": "Communication with God", "completion": "I recently talked to a co-worker of mine and we got into a discussion about God talking to us in other ways besides Scripture. She claims that she hears God talking to her in her thoughts. She says she hears his voice. I told her I have never had that experience and that I don't think God talks to us that way. We get our answers through Scripture. I know God works in mysterious ways, but it is hard for me to wrap my mind around God speaking to us personally about how are lives will turn out in our thoughts or dreams. My question is: Does God talk to us with a voice in our thoughts or our dreams?\n\n\nGod of course can do anything.\u00a0 He can communicate to us any way he wants.\u00a0 The Bible describes instances when God did speak directly to people, through others and in dreams.\u00a0 The fact that God communicated in these ways in the past does not guarantee that God will do so in the future.\u00a0 We have no promise of God communicating to us beyond Scripture.\nWhat the Bible does say is that \u201cIn the past God spoke to our forefathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son\u2026\u201d (Hebrews 1:1-2).\u00a0 We have God\u2019s full communication to us in the pages of the Old and New Testament.\u00a0 There is no need to look elsewhere for communication from God.\u00a0 In addition, God tells us that dreams can actually be a tool of people who want to mislead and deceive us (Jeremiah 23:25-28).\nIf there is a \u201cvoice\u201d from God inside us, it is the natural knowledge of his law and a conscience that is guided properly by Holy Scripture.\u00a0 If there is a \u201cvoice\u201d from God inside us, it is the new self\u2014that part of us that is \u201ccreated to be like God in true righteousness and holiness\u201d (Ephesians 4:24)\u2014that desires to live life according to God\u2019s will.\nWe do well to focus on God\u2019s communication to us through the Bible\u2014and our communication to him in prayer."}
{"prompt": "Suffering and Evil", "completion": "How could God allow suffering and evil?\n\n\nThis is a classic question. When it\u2019s a challenge to the Christian faith, trying to prove that God doesn\u2019t exist, it\u2019s usually phrased like this: \u201cIf God is truly omniscient (all-knowing) and omnipotent (all-powerful) and loving, how could he allow suffering and evil?\u201d\nHere is a classic answer.\nGod exists. Jesus said he does, and he rose from the dead to show that he could be trusted to tell the truth.\nGod is all-knowing. That trustworthy Jesus said so. And since God knows everything, he is smarter than we are. So he may do or say things that are perfectly right, but we don\u2019t understand them, because we\u2019re not as smart. We have that experience every day with people who are smarter than we are.\nGod is all-powerful. In philosophical terms, all-powerful means that he can do whatever he wants. He can always put his will into action.\nGod is loving. God showed his love for all people by sending a Savior (John 3:16).\nDoes God allow evil to occur? That depends on how you define evil. Sometimes what seems bad or evil to one person seems good to another person.\nBut let\u2019s grant that God does allow evil to occur. It\u2019s only temporary. Death intervenes. Since God is smarter, perhaps that temporary evil actually turns out to be for some good in the end. For example, the Bible tells the story of a man whose brothers sold him into slavery. That was evil. But it turned out for good. The man himself said so (Genesis 50:20).\nSince God is smarter than I am, I trust that when he allows evil or suffering in my life, it will work out for my good (Romans 8:28). Since he\u2019s loving, I trust that everything really will work out for the best in my life. And since he\u2019s all-powerful, I can ask him to get rid of the evil, and trust that if that\u2019s what he wants at that time, he can and he will (Matthew 7:7)."}

{"prompt": "Fearing God", "completion": "Can you help me understand what the Bible means when it says we are to \"fear\" God? Some have said it is just to have an awe of him. I find this understanding inconsistent with Scripture as little as I know. Fear is fear, and isn't it caused by sin and our sinful desires to turn from God, not some sense of awe of him? Is it a fair comparison to say we fear the wrath of our parents when we have done wrong but this fear is alleviated with the knowledge that they love us and forgive us of our wrongs? \n\n\nYou ask an excellent question, and I especially appreciate your desire to analyze a word that the Bible uses quite a bit. One might say that the basic meaning of the word \u201cto fear\u201d is to \u201cstand in awe of\u201d or even revere. It is also accurate to add that invariably more needs to be said\u2014and each time that the \u201cfear of God\u201d is mentioned, the Bible reader needs to take note of the relationship the person or people have with God. Only when that is done will we have the more precise meaning of \u201cfearing God\u201d in that particular passage. It might (and often does) involve being afraid of, but it might also be emphasizing happily revering or respecting God with awe.\nMaybe a word picture or illustration will be helpful to you as it has been to others for many years:\nQuestion: \u201cDo you fear a locomotive?\u201d Answer: \u201cYes, always\u2014but first I must analyze my relationship to the locomotive to be more accurate or helpful in explaining myself. If I am trapped on the railroad tracks in front of the locomotive and it is coming toward me, I fear it in this sense that I am very much afraid and in dread of it. Its awesome power will crush me. But if I am comfortably seated in a passenger car being pulled by that powerful locomotive, and it is taking me to a destination I delight in, I still fear the locomotive by respecting and being in awe of its brute force, but I am happy about this power and delight in its awesome capability for my benefit. If I ever find myself in a bad relationship to that locomotive, my respect also becomes a dread, but if my relationship to it is a good and healthy one, I remain in awe but am happily respecting it.\u201d\nThe point is that God does not change and is always worthy of \u201cfear.\u201d For those who despise his gracious promises in Christ, that fear is to include terror. For those brought to trust the gracious promises in Christ, that fear loses its terror but remains filled with awe (as expressed in Psalm 130:3-4) at such a forgiving God."}
{"prompt": "Where did God come from?", "completion": "This is something that has always been on my mind and that my children ask me all the time. Where did God come from? It is hard to understand that because we know everything comes from something. So how did God come into existence? \n\n\nYour children are asking a question that the strong majority of people ask sooner or later. Because, as you say, we assume that \u201ceverything comes from something,\u201d it makes logical sense to assume that God came from something at some point in time.\nOur only answer is to express what the Bible tells us about God. God didn\u2019t come from anything. He always was and always will be. Passages like Psalm 90:2 and Psalm 93:2 touch on this subject. \u201cEternity\u201d and \u201ceverlasting\u201d are terms that we finite creatures use to express the concept of something that has no end and/or no beginning. God has no beginning or end. He is outside the realm of time. The problem in saying this, of course, is that we cannot comprehend the idea of being beyond time or being without beginning or end. What Solomon expressed in Ecclesiastes 3:11 is humbling but true. We are informed of the concept but cannot fathom it.\nI suggest that in talking about this to your children you simply emphasize that\u00a0(1) God is different from everyone and everything else. Everything else comes from something (ultimately from God himself), but God doesn\u2019t. He is simply different; and (2) God is especially different in the kind of love he shows to us. He loves us so much that, even though we disobey him and often disrespect him, he sent Jesus to take away the guilt of our sin and adopt us into his family as dear children.\nIn this way, your answer can redirect the curiosity of your children to a subject they (and we) can better understand and appreciate. When we are more fully occupied with the gospel, we grow more content with what we do not know."}

No one has ever seen gravity, but I see evidence of it is all around. As a matter of fact, we depend on it for almost all of our everyday activities. Gravity holds our cars on the road. It keeps us from floating away into space. We would be in serious trouble without it.\nLook at God in very much the same way that you look at gravity. You have never seen him, but you see evidence that he must exist in the world. Whether taking in a soft summer sunset or a late night display of the constellations, know that someone took some serious time and effort to get things just right. The Bible puts it this way, \u201cEvery house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything.\u201d (Hebrews 3:4)\nHave you ever taken time to look closely at the world in which we live? Get up a little earlier than normal tomorrow and let the sunrise speak for itself. You decide which is more impressive, the beauty of the sunrise or the fact that is has risen every day in the history of the world. You will hear an inaudible voice in that sunrise. It is God\u2019s voice. (Psalm 19:1-4)\nPerhaps you are more impressed with detail. Take time to count the hairs on one of your arms from your wrist to your elbow. As you notice the delicacy with which each hair is connected, consider how hard plastic surgeons work to duplicate a \u201cnormal\u201d hair pattern. They never do get it quite right, do they? All of this is part of God\u2019s great attention to detail and more evidence that he does exist.\nWe have never seen God, but, like gravity, we know he is here. He has taken the time to leave evidence of his existence all around the world in which we live. Take time to notice it. You will see that he is very real.

It is not a matter of mathematics or human logic, but a mystery. Remember that in the creeds we do not say, \u201cWe understand.\u201d Instead we say, \u201cWe believe.\u201d\nBy the same token, we do not know how God did what he did at Jesus\u2019 baptism. We only know from Scripture that he did it. This is true of much that God has done and that he does now.\nThe most important thing for you and me to remember about the Trinity is that God sent his Son to save us, that the Son did that, and that the Holy Spirit uses Word and sacrament to create and preserve faith in us."}
{"prompt": "Explaining the Trinity", "completion": "What's the best way to explain the Triune God? I understand it's three separate entities in one unity, but just by what I said, am I saying it wrong? I want to make sure I'm correct before explaining it.\n\n\nThe Bible doesn\u2019t use the terms that we use when talking about the Trinity in exactly the same way that we do. We learn from Scripture, however, that there is a certain respect in which God is absolutely, indivisibly one (Deuteronomy 4:35, Deuteronomy 6:4, 1 Corinthians 8:4, etc.), and that this one God is a self-aware ego who can speak and say \u201cI.\u201d We also find that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are not the same, that each of them is also a self-aware ego that can refer to himself as \u201cI,\u201d and that they relate to one another in certain ways (Isaiah 61:1, Mark 1:9-11, etc.). In this respect, therefore, God is not one, but three.\nOver the centuries the Church has settled on \u201cessence\u201d as the best term for the way in which God is one, and on \u201cperson\u201d as the best term for the way in which God is three. That\u2019s why we speak about three distinct persons\u2014Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\u2014but only one divine essence.\nWe should be clear, however, that in choosing one term for God\u2019s one-ness and another for God\u2019s three-ness, we really haven\u2019t explained anything. Scripture\u2019s teaching of the Trinity remains an unsolvable logical paradox."}
{"prompt": "Role of the Holy Spirit", "completion": "What is the role of the Holy Spirit in the life of a Christian?\n\n\nAs true God along with God the Father and God the Son (Jesus Christ), the Holy Spirit participates in the divine works that the Father and Son also do. This would include giving and maintaining our physical lives (creation and providence work) and convicting us of our sin, guilt, and need for the Savior\u2019s work so that we may grasp the redeeming work of Jesus through Spirit-given faith. And he in a miraculous way guided the human writers (prophets and apostles) of the Bible books to write precisely what God wanted them to provide for our faith-life.\nYou ask more specifically what the Holy Spirit does for believers. Luther\u2019s famous Explanation of the Third Article of the Apostles Creed offers an excellent summary:\nI believe that I cannot by my own thinking or choosing believe in Jesus Christ, my Lord, or come to Him. But the Holy Spirit has called me by the Gospel, enlightened me with His gifts, sanctified and kept me in the true faith. In the same way He calls, gathers, enlightens, and sanctifies the whole Christian Church on earth, and keeps it with Jesus Christ in the one true faith. In this Christian Church He daily and fully forgives all sins to me and all believers. On the Last Day, He will raise me and all the dead and give eternal life to me and all believers in Christ. This is most certainly true.\nYou also ask if the Holy Spirit is really necessary for spiritual growth and positive changes in our spiritual lives \u2014 or whether sanctified common sense is enough. The Spirit is necessary if we are talking about true spiritual growth, changes in our heart and inner attitudes and motives \u2014 in short, more than external behavior changes. The power of God is needed for such transformations in faith and the resulting faith-life. We can only change external behavior patterns on our own \u2014 which may look good on the outside for a while, but will lack the inner changes in motives and attitude that will characterize the real deal.\nFor more detailed information, with Bible passages that speak of these things specifically, ask your pastor for a book that will provide that kind of information."}

A fellow Catholic friend of mine suggests, no, we cannot be assured - how do we know we have paid for the damage of our sins? We need final purification before entrance into heaven and that the Bible states that few get gateway into heaven. Please help me to understand.\n\n\nYou are correct in understanding the significance of Good Friday and Easter.\u00a0 On the cross Jesus proclaimed, \u201cIt is finished\u201d (John 19:30).\u00a0 He announced that he paid in full the debt of our sins.\u00a0 His rising to life on Easter Sunday was proof positive of the Father\u2019s acceptance of his redeeming work (Romans 4:25).\nYou are also correct in understanding that Spirit-worked faith in Jesus brings into a person\u2019s life the blessings of forgiveness, peace and eternal life.\u00a0 As followers of Christ we can be confident that we will be with God forever in heaven because we have God\u2019s own assurance and promise of that (Mark 16:16; John 3:15-16; 10:28; 14:2; Romans 6:23).\nWhen the debt of sin has been paid in full, there is no more debt to be paid.\u00a0 When the perfect sacrifice for sin has been paid\u2014and forgiveness of sins has been received in faith\u2014there is no more sacrifice that can be made or needs to be made.\u00a0 Hebrews 10 makes that very clear.\nFinally, 1 John 1:7 tells us that \u201cthe blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin.\u201d\u00a0 Not some sins or most sins, but all sin.\nBecause salvation is God\u2019s doing from beginning to end, you and I can be absolutely certain of our status right now as members of God\u2019s family, and we can confidently claim heaven as our eternal home."}
{"prompt": "Memories in Heaven", "completion": "When we die and go to heaven will we remember anything from on Earth? like memories? and people? \n\n\nScripture says relatively little about what things will be like for us between the time of our death and the day of the Resurrection. That means we should be careful not to say too much. We will still be ourselves (minus sin) with all that that entails. That would suggest we will have certain kinds of consciousness and memories, though none of these will cause us any pain.\nWe will be with Christ (Philippians 1:23), and we will certainly recognize him. There are passages that seem to show that the souls of those in both heaven and hell have other kinds of awareness, including recognition of other people. See Revelation 6:9-10 and Luke 16:19-31."}
{"prompt": "Pets in Heaven", "completion": "My understanding is that animals don't have souls, and therefore do not go to heaven as human believers do. My dog died today and I can't help grieving that he is gone. Is there a possibility that even though he doesn't have a soul, I might be able to meet up with him again? \n\n\nIt is natural to grieve the loss of a dear pet, but we have no reason to believe there will be a resurrection for animals as for people. Since our eternal home is a new heavens and a new earth, it is possible that there will be animals there. Is Isaiah 11:6-9 figurative or literal? We will have to wait and see.\nHowever God provides it, you will have the joy you had with your dog without the sorrow sin has brought to all creation. It is part of the tragedy of sin that the animals suffer along with us, and Romans 8:19-22 says the whole creation will be redeemed from bondage. There is, however, nothing in Scripture that leads us to expect a resurrection for specific animals."}
{"prompt": "Recognizing others in Heaven", "completion": "My mother passed away and I'm wondering when I die, will I see her and recognize her in heaven? \n\n\nPlease accept our sincere sympathy on the loss of your mother. With you, we are confident that the surpassing joy of knowing that she is now with her Savior in glory will allow you to focus on what she and you have, not on what you have temporarily lost. On the matter of believers recognizing each other in heaven, we admit that there is limited Bible information on this. But there is also ample evidence for us to hold this belief. \nIn our Savior\u2019s account of the rich man and poor Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31) we note that the rich man, in hell, looked up and saw Lazarus with Abraham. There was recognition, even beyond the citizens of heaven. The account of our Lord\u2019s transfiguration (Matthew 17:1-13) has Peter, James, and John seeing and somehow recognizing Moses and Elijah, although we are not informed how they were enabled to do so. But personal recognition remains real.\nOther Bible sections may be cited. Among them is Matthew 8:11, \u201cI say to you that many will come from the east and the west, and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.\u201d The language of our Lord seems to indicate that we will know and recognize the patriarchs by name. 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 gives pointed comfort pertaining to Christ\u2019s second coming and the reunion of believers who had been separated by physical death. \u201cWe who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever.\u201d The comforting assurance established by the context of the passage is that we need not worry about fellow believers who die before (or after) we do. Reunion will happen\u2014and the ability to recognize each other seems to fit well with the point being made. \nFinally, there are several Bible references to the \u201cbook of life\u201d and our names being recorded there by our gracious Lord God. In Revelation 3:5, for example, we are told, \u201cHe who overcomes will, like them, be dressed in white. I will never blot out his name from the book of life, but will acknowledge his name before my Father and his angels.\u201d While our bodies will be glorified, and we will in some way be changed, our names appear to be unchanged and used for identification. And with regard to our transformed or glorified bodies, they will be patterned after the glorified body of our Lord Jesus following his resurrection (see Philippians 3:21)."}
{"prompt": "Visits from deceased", "completion": "Many of the people I know believe that they have been visited by deceased loved ones in the form of birds or other \"signs.\" This seems to bring them comfort. I have told them I believe that while birds or other things can be beautiful reminders of our loved ones, they don't come back for a visit. They tell me they \"felt\" it and it was real. How can I lovingly let them know this is not true without making them feel their grief for the person all over again. I know we are to \"speak the truth in love.\" I don't want to drive them from Jesus by making them angry at me so they won't hear me. \n\n\nYou are doing well in carefully listening to your friends, tactfully asking them questions and responding in love with Scripture.\u00a0 You do not specify whether or not your friends claim to embrace Christianity.\u00a0 If that is the case, it would be fair to ask them where the Bible speaks of reincarnation.\u00a0 (It does not, of course.)\u00a0 The Bible does state that \u201cMan is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment\u201d (Hebrews 9:27).\u00a0 The Bible does describe people who have been judged as being in heaven or hell, with no possibility of leaving either place (Luke 16:19-31).\u00a0\u00a0 The comfort we have about loved ones who have died in the Christian faith is that they are in the presence of the Lord (Revelation 14:13), not that they have returned to us in some other form.\u00a0 Statements from God in the Bible override any of our feelings to the contrary.\nIf the friends you reference are not Christians, then their ideas of death are likely associated with many other wrong ideas.\u00a0 That requires patient listening and witnessing on your part.\u00a0 Point them to Jesus who alone gives eternal life (John 3:16; 11:25-26).\nIn either case, you partially answered your own question in that you want to \u201cspeak the truth in love\u201d (Ephesians 4:15) to these friends and all whom you meet in life."}
{"prompt": "Guardian angels", "completion": "Does the Bible state whether or not we have guardian angels? Does it tell us if angels will come to take us to heaven?\n\n\nScripture comforts us with the truth that angels are watching over us as Christians, protecting us from harm (Psalm 90:11,12). However, it does not tell us whether or not we each have a personal guardian angel. It could be that God sends a group of angels to protect a group of Christians. Either way, we have the same comfort\u2014not only does the Lord promise to watch over us, but he promises his angels will do the same. God gives us the cake\u2014the comfort that he watches over us. He also puts frosting on the cake\u2014he gives us the comfort that angels are also protecting us.\nYou also ask whether angels will take a person to heaven at death. Scripture does seem to indicate this. When Lazarus died, Luke 16:22 says, \u201cThe angels carried him to Abraham\u2019s side.\u201d The horses of fire and chariot of fire that appeared when Elijah was carried directly to heaven (2 Kings 2) also seem to be angels. That seems to be one of the blessed tasks that God has assigned to his angels. It would also be consistent with their work of protecting us from harm. In the Lord\u2019s Prayer we ask God to deliver us from evil. We know that the final answer to this prayer will come when God takes us out of this life to himself in heaven."}
{"prompt": "Becoming angels", "completion": "Someone had mentioned to me how our loved ones become angels after they die and watch over those they left behind. I know this not to be true, as the angels were created by God before man during the Creation week, but I did not have a specific passage to let the person know that the number of angels does not increase or decrease. Could you please provide the solid scriptural references I need to be able to address this person and guide them lovingly in the truth? Thank you!\n\n\nFirst, let me commend you for the wonderful attitude in which you are trying to relay the truth of God\u2019s Word to others (\u201cguide them lovingly in the truth\u201d).\u00a0 Your words illustrate that Christian witnessing is not a matter of debating and arguing; it is presenting the truth and leaving the results in God\u2019s hands.\nYou are correct in stating that the number of angels is fixed.\u00a0 Scripture makes it clear that angels are different from human beings.\u00a0 The Bible describes angels as spirit beings, not having physical bodies (Hebrews 1:14).\nWe also learn important information about angels when Jesus answered a question about earthly marriage.\u00a0 He said:\u00a0 \u201cThe people of this age marry and are given in marriage.\u00a0 But those who are considered worthy of taking part in that age and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage, and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels\u201d (Luke 20:34-36).\u00a0 Angels do not marry or procreate.\u00a0 Those are activities for human beings\u2014but only in this life.\nGod\u2019s blessings on your testifying\u2014lovingly\u2014to the truth!"}
{"prompt": "Hell a physical place", "completion": "Is hell an actual, physical place or just a state of being, as a certain pastor claims?\n\n\nThe Bible describes hell as real.\u00a0 Rather than being a geographical location that people can point to, theologians refer to hell as a \u201csomewhere.\u201d\u00a0 It is where people are forsaken by God and punished for their sins forever.\nWith no disrespect to your question by any means, the words of Chrysostom in the fourth century come to mind:\u00a0 \u201cLet us not so much labor to know where hell is\u2014as how to escape it.\u201d\u00a0 And that we do know.\u00a0 On the cross of Calvary Jesus Christ suffered what amounts to hell:\u00a0 he was abandoned and forsaken by his heavenly Father, punished for the sins of the world (Matthew 27:46).\u00a0 Through Spirit-worked faith in Jesus, forgiveness of sins is ours and heaven\u2014not hell\u2014is our eternal home."}
{"prompt": "Is Hell eternal?", "completion": "How can I show from Scriptures that hell is forever (eternal)? A friend I met insists God loves all people and wants them to be saved; that Jesus died for the sins of the whole world; and that if some spend eternity in hell, Jesus would not be an effectual Savior of all people.\n\n\nBefore proving scripturally that hell is forever, it\u2019s wise to make sure your friend knows where you agree with him. When he says God is love, and that God loves all and desires all people be saved, he is correctly summarizing 1 John 4:16, John 3:16 and 1 Tim. 2:4. We not only agree that Jesus died for the world\u2019s sins (1 John 2:2), we even proclaim that God declared the entire world not guilty in Jesus (Rom. 5:18).\nBut while your friend is correctly sharing some scriptural truths, he is, perhaps unknowingly, omitting others.\nYour friend isn\u2019t alone. Many Christians feel that God\u2019s reputation as a gracious God is forfeited if we don\u2019t modify the historic confession that hell is conscious, eternal suffering for everyone who dies in unbelief.\nOur task, however, is not to make God sound palatable to cultural sensibilities. Yes, Scripture is clear that Jesus is Savior of all and that he also desires the salvation of those who do not acknowledge him. His tears for the unbelievers in Jerusalem were genuine (Luke 19:41).\nYet Jesus talks about hell more forcefully, frequently, and fully than anyone. He tells us that the broad and busy superhighway is the one leading to hell not heaven (Matt. 7:13). It is Jesus who vividly portrays the conscious, eternal suffering of the damned as he tells us about the rich man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19f).\nIt is also Jesus who coins the most common description of hell: the place where there is \u201cweeping and gnashing of teeth\u201d (Matt. 8:12, 13:42, 13:50, 22:13, 24:51, 25:30). If we inquire how long this \u201cweeping and gnashing of teeth\u201d continues, he tells us in Matthew 25. After Jesus pronounces judgment on the sheep and goats (believers and unbelievers), he announces that the unbelievers \u201cwill go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life\u201d (Matthew 25:46). We can no more argue biblically against the eternity of hell than the eternity of heaven."}
{"prompt": "Explaining Hell", "completion": "How do you explain to someone the idea of hell who doesn't believe in it? \n\n\nTo explain the doctrine of hell you need to point people to the passages in the Bible that speak about hell. It is described as a place of torment that will never end, prepared for the devil and his angels. There unbelievers will spend eternity. (Isaiah 64:24, Matthew 3:12, Matthew 13:42, Matthew 25:41, Matthew 5:29-30, 2 Thessalonians 1:6-9, Jude 7, 2 Peter 2:4, Luke 16:19-31, Mark 9:43-48).\nUnless people understand the law, which reveals the depths of human sinfulness and God\u2019s righteous wrath over sin, they will have difficulty grasping a place of eternal punishment. You might want to review what God says in Romans 1:18,19 and Romans 3:9-20. Make sure also to remember God\u2019s salvation, his plan of deliverance through faith in his Son, Jesus, whom he offered up as a sacrifice of atonement for our sins\u2014and not only for ours but for the sins of the whole world (Romans 3:21-28, 2 Corinthians 5:18-21, 1 John 2:2). If a person understands the depths of his sinfulness and the punishment he deserves, he will more readily grasp the depths of God\u2019s love in offering his Son for our salvation. A proper understanding of the law and the gospel is important for a correct understanding of hell and heaven."}
{"prompt": "Satan's Power", "completion": "I'm wondering about the extent of the Devil's power to tempt us. I heard once that Satan caused Judas to despair over his sins. Wouldn't Satan have to enter a person's thought process to tempt the person to despair? Could you elaborate on Satan's power/ability to manipulate our thoughts and enter our minds to tempt us in our areas of weakness. Thanks!\n\n\nThere is so much we don\u2019t know about the spirit world of angels and demons and how it all works. All we can do is look at what Scripture reveals to us.\nIt is true that Satan does not have the ability to read our thoughts the way God does. He is not all-knowing. However, it is clear from Scripture that he is able to tempt us, which includes entering our minds and affecting our thought processes. Scripture warns us to avoid sinful thoughts, words, actions, and emotions so that we do not give the devil a foothold (Ephesians 4:27). 2 Corinthians 4:4 mentions that he is able to blind the minds of unbelievers.\nYou also refer to Judas Iscariot. Luke 22:3 states that \u201cSatan entered Judas\u201d and that \u201cthe devil prompted him to betray Jesus\u201d (John 13:2). It adds, \u201cAs soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him\u201d (John 13:27).\u00a0 With Judas it does not appear as though Satan actually possessed him but rather that the devil exerted a destructive influence on his heart and mind. This would indicate that Satan can \u201cget into our mind\u201d and affect us in ways that we do not understand. He is a fallen angel and as such has powers that are far superior to our own as human beings. At the same time, he is only a fallen angel and no match for God.\nYou also talk about the devil tempting us in our areas of weakness. The devil knows our pet sins and where we are most vulnerable. He knows this not because he is all-knowing, but because he has spent a lot of time studying us. He has observed which sins we struggle against. When he tempts us, he will try to take advantage of our weaknesses.\nTo help balance this discussion, it is important to remember that God also knows us. He knows everything about us. But unlike the devil, God uses this knowledge to help us not hurt us. He knows where we are weak, and he seeks to strengthen us. He knows what we need\u2013a Savior\u2013and has provided for that need in his Son. He reminds us that he defeated the devil through Jesus\u2019 life and death. Because of Christ, God assures us that nothing can separate us from his love. Not even demons (Romans 8:38)."}
{"prompt": "Aliens and demons", "completion": "One is often exposed to stories and reports of encounters with aliens from outer space. I believe that most of these cases can be explained as hoaxes, mistaken interpretations of an experience, or someone wanting attention. Despite that, there are some instances in which an \"encounter\" cannot be completely explained away. Is it possible that demons could be at work in trying to deceive people by taking on the appearance of an alien, or the image that most people believe an alien would look like? I think it is within the realm of demonic activity for this to be possible. Am I wrong? Thank you.\n\n\nI don\u2019t believe you are wrong in suggesting that possibility\u2014and that\u2019s all it is, a possibility.\u00a0 The Bible reminds us that \u201cOur struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms\u201d (Ephesians 6:12).\u00a0 Satan is an enemy whose power exceeds our own.\u00a0 His goal is to destroy faith in people who believe and keep others in unbelief (2 Corinthians 4:4).\u00a0 There is no telling what Satan might attempt to do to carry out his goals.\nThankfully we are dealing with a defeated enemy, one whose head has been crushed (Genesis 3:15).\u00a0 Jesus Christ shared in our humanity \u201cso that by his death he might destroy him who holds the power of death\u2014that is, the devil\u201d (Hebrews 2:14).\u00a0 By his holy life, death and resurrection Jesus has destroyed Satan, and it is only a matter of time before he is put out of commission entirely (Revelation 20:10).\u00a0 Until that time, Christians like you and I carry out God\u2019s instruction:\u00a0 \u201cPut on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil\u2019s schemes\u201d (Ephesians 6:11).\u00a0 We do that trusting in God\u2019s promise:\u00a0 \u201cResist the devil, and he will flee from you\u201d (James 4:7)."}
{"prompt": "Who is Satan", "completion": "Who is Satan?\n\n\nHave you ever seen the Loch Ness Monster? How about Sasquatch or Big Foot? These are only a few of the imaginary creatures we hear about. Their \u201csightings\u201d make front page news in the tabloids.\nThere is a city in Northern Wisconsin that calls itself \u201cThe Home of the Hodag.\u201d According to Eugene Sheperd, who supposedly discovered the hodag in 1893, it has \u201cthe head of a frog, the grinning face of a giant elephant, thick short legs set off by huge claws, the back of a dinosaur, and a long tail with spears at the end.\u201d It\u2019s a popular creature in the area. Even the local high school has the hodag as its mascot.\nSome people see Satan as a fictional creature. He\u2019s the little red man with horns and a pitchfork. Or he\u2019s the ghost-like figure that can scare the bejeebers out of you in a movie like \u201cExorcist.\u201d Or that handsome looking guy that is portrayed in the TV series, \u201cReaper.\u201d\nIsn\u2019t it interesting that even a guy like Anton LaVey didn\u2019t believe Satan was real. The late Lavey was the leading Satanist in recent times. He even worshipped Satan! Yet he didn\u2019t believe he was a real person. Only a negative power source that stood for all that is evil.\nSo who is Satan? Or what is he? A monster? A mascot? A movie star? Satan may be all of these, but one thing he isn\u2019t is imaginary. Satan is real. And he is a personal being\u2014not with flesh and bones but a spiritual \u201cbeing.\u201d That might sound complex, but really it\u2019s quite simple.\nThe Bible calls Satan a fallen angel. At first there were only good angels. God gave them a choice to serve him or serve themselves. Some of them rebelled against God and decided to serve themselves. Satan was a leader of this group and he led a large number of angels in a rebellion against God. The good angels stayed with God, continue to serve God, and enjoy God\u2019s blessings. Satan and the evil angels rejected God, hate him with a passion, and serve themselves. (See 2 Peter 2:4 and Jude 6)\nAs an evil angel, Satan is pretty powerful, but not nearly as powerful as God. Jesus is proof of that. He took on the devil in one-on-one combat and it wasn\u2019t even close. It turned out just as God said it would. Satan bruised the heal of Jesus, but got his head crushed in the process. That\u2019s what the cross did.\nThe amazing thing is that Jesus crushed all our sins in the process. Like Satan, the bad things we do are real. Yet the cross is also real. And that is where Christ defeated Satan and won real life, real hope, real forgiveness."}
{"prompt": "Satan speaking", "completion": "We know that Satan cannot read our thoughts but can he speak to us through our thoughts or are our sinful thoughts just a product of our sinful nature? In other words, if the Holy Spirit can guide our thoughts, does Satan also have the capability to guide our thoughts or can he only affect our \"situations\" to manipulate us by creating doubt and other thoughts that hinder our faith? I have heard televangelists and those of that saying things like \"those voices in our heads are Satan talking to us\" but I find no scriptural basis for that belief other than Old Testament documentation of Satan speaking directly to people like Eve.\n\n\nYou ask important questions.\u00a0 Satan is a formidable enemy (Ephesians 6:12).\u00a0 By his powerful resurrection from the dead, Jesus crushed Satan\u2019s head, just as Scripture had prophesied (Genesis 3:15).\u00a0 Satan has been defeated.\u00a0 \u201cHe knows that his time is short\u201d (Revelation 12:12) until he is put out of commission once and for all (Revelation 20:10).\u00a0 Until that time, Satan\u2019s mission is to try to fill hell with as many souls as possible.\nWhile the Bible does describe Satan, a fallen angel, as having powers and abilities greater than ours, it does not give us many specifics.\u00a0 Beyond demon possession, which your questions do not address, we know that Satan \u201centered into\u201d Judas (John 13:27).\u00a0 The apostle Paul wrote of Satan that \u201cThe god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God\u201d (2 Corinthians 4:4).\u00a0 Satan certainly knows our weaknesses and can use that knowledge to his advantage in ways we can only imagine.\nIn your first question you mention our sinful natures.\u00a0 That is an area of our lives that certainly deserves attention.\u00a0 It is so easy for Christians (and the televangelists you mentioned) to blame Satan for all their sins and troubles.\u00a0 I sometimes get the impression that people think that locking up Satan somewhere right now would eliminate their struggles with sin.\u00a0 That kind of thinking fails to realize how thoroughly corrupt the sinful nature is.\u00a0 The sinful nature is an ally of Satan.\u00a0 It is hostile toward God (Romans 8:7).\u00a0 It is the place where evil thoughts originate (Matthew 15:19).\u00a0 It wants nothing to do with God or godliness.\u00a0 It continually wars against our new self (Romans 7:18-25).\nThe sinful nature is an enemy that needs our continual attention.\u00a0 Recall what our Catechism says:\u00a0 \u201cBaptism means that the old Adam in us should be drowned by daily contrition and repentance, and that all its evil deeds and desires be put to death.\u201d\u00a0 We do that by putting off the sinful nature, rejecting its temptations and confessing our sins when we give in to temptation (Colossians 2:11-12; Romans 6:2, 3, 6, 12, 13).\u00a0 At the same time, we build up the new self through the use of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nChristians long for the day when they no longer fight against the ungodly trio:\u00a0 the devil, the world and our sinful flesh.\u00a0 That day is when our earthly lives come to an end.\u00a0 Until then, we \u201cfight the good fight of the faith\u201d (1 Timothy 6:12)."}
{"prompt": "Deal with the Devil", "completion": "Is it possible for a person actually to make a deal with the devil?\r\n\n\n\nThe concept of making a deal with the devil or selling one\u2019s soul to Satan in exchange for something is rooted in secular literature and folktales, but has no Bible basis. Johann Wolfgang Goethe\u2019s fictional Dr. Faustus made such a deal with the devil. Other fictional stories are based on that premise, notably short stories by Washington Irving, (The Devil and Tom Walker) and Stephen Vincent Benet (The Devil and Daniel Webster). To repeat, the Bible has no example of a person \u201cselling his soul\u201d to Satan, and Scripture never implies that making a bargain with the devil is possible.\nAt the heart of such a concept is some truth and lots of error. The truth part takes Satan seriously. He is powerful, deceptive, and constantly seeking to lead people away from revealed truth of Scripture and saving faith in Jesus Christ. The error in all this forgets that the devil is really not an independent agent and warden of hell; he is an inmate in hell and subject to God\u2019s authority and will. Those who do evil and choose to despise Christ and God\u2019s gracious will for their faith and faith-life end up joining Satan in opposition to God and will forfeit divine blessings as they receive expressions of God\u2019s just judgment just as Satan does and will continue to do. The devil doesn\u2019t ultimately cause all this; they do, tragically and unnecessarily. This is their own fault. They really sold their soul to wickedness and forfeited divine blessing.\nGeneral word of wisdom: Neither underestimate nor overestimate the power and deceptive nature of the devil. Be alert to his working yet never forget he is already defeated and not an independent agent who enjoys freedom to work evil. And never neglect or underestimate the power and comfort of the gospel of Jesus Christ for ourselves and the world!"}
{"prompt": "Communion and living together", "completion": "Can I take communion if I live with my fianc\u00e9? We are getting married in about a month, and I have not been taking communion. \n\n\nThank you for your thoughtful approach to this important kind of question. Your spiritual well-being is of utmost importance and your desire to receive the Lord\u2019s Supper in a fitting way is a good evidence that you need clear answers to your concerns.\nOne of the requirements for a proper reception of Communion is that the person is not guilty of willful sin (that is, sinning when you know it is sin but for some reason continue to commit that sin). While we are all sinners, God calls us to express daily sorrow for sin and repentance, which includes reliance on Jesus as our Savior. Living with someone who is not your marriage partner (even a fianc\u00e9) is a sin since, as normally defined, it involves sexual immorality and causes others to stumble spiritually when they observe your lifestyle and get the impression this is compatible with Christian lifestyle. This calls for repentance that involves a rejection and turning away from the sin as well as a turning to Christ for pardon and new life.\nIn short, as long as you fail to repent of this sin, you are not in a position to receive Communion in a proper and beneficial way. It would be spiritually harmful.\u00a0 You are to be urged to stop this sinful lifestyle, cast your guilt on Christ by faith, and then see yourself as a perfect candidate for blessings through the sacrament. Don\u2019t seek to excuse your living arrangement on the basis of your scheduled marriage in a month or so. And don\u2019t deceive yourself into thinking that once you are married you will then express sorrow for what you did and think everything is okay. You and I and all others are called by God to repent daily \u2014 now \u2014 and to reject sin and cling to Christ. And live a new life, starting every day.\nI repeat: I am thankful that you have asked this question and that you still have a desire to take Communion. I believe this indicates that you are wrestling with a guilty conscience and understand within yourself that there is a special need for special assurances of God\u2019s love. May you keep first things first, by rejecting sin and expressing repentance with faith. And may the same be true of your fianc\u00e9, who is equally guilty of sin and equally called to repent and rely on Jesus Christ.\nI also recommend that you sit down with your pastor to discuss this more fully. He knows you and the situation better than I do and can give you more specific encouragements and counsel."}
{"prompt": "Open Communion", "completion": "Why does WELS not practice open communion including the communion of children?\n\n\nThere are several reasons. These may be simply stated here, but each point deserves more discussion with attention to specific Bible passages that guide us in applying these principles. So I\u2019ll give you a brief list here and now but strongly encourage you and your husband to sit down with your pastor to discuss the issues that surface. The pastor may then expand the Bible points that most need attention and best serve you and your husband as you seek appropriate answers to your questions.\nThe practice of close or closed communion refers to our desire to speak with potential communicants prior to their receiving communion with us and to make sure adequate Bible instruction as well as a unity in our beliefs is present prior to communing together. The main reasons why we do this are these:\n\nWe want to protect souls who might do damage to themselves since the Lord\u2019s Supper is for believers who are not only baptized but also instructed and knowledgeable about what they receive in the sacrament and why.\nWe want to protect souls since those who commune are to examine themselves prior to communing, so we want to be sure those who commune with us have been trained how to do this and possess the level of understanding and maturity to make it meaningful.\nWe want to protect souls and show integrity as we publicly confess Bible truths since all who commune together are expressing unity in the Christian faith and in their allegience to the Bible. We want this expression to be genuine and not a sham or hypocritical pretending we have unity if indeed we don\u2019t.\n\nSo we want to speak with potential communicants when we are not sure\u00a0about their preparation\u00a0to receive the sacrament."}
{"prompt": "Close communion and membership", "completion": "Hi there, While I am not a member, I have been attending a WELS church. I have been told why your congregation does \\\"close\\\" Communion and respect your stance on it. However, I have chosen not to be a member because I feel that me being a member of the body of Christ trumps any other membership. So, I was wondering what God is going to say on judgement day that other Christians have denied me the right to partake in the Lord\\'s Supper because I would not become a member of their church. Does being a member really guarantee your congregation that one is truly partaking in Communion in the manner Christ intended? Isn\\'t that between me and the Lord? I ask this lovingly and just can\\'t wrap my head around this practice. I would graciously accept any insight. Thank you and God bless.\n\n\nClose(d) Communion is the historic and biblical practice of the Christian Church.\u00a0 The practice has the purposes of ensuring that, as far as humanly possible, those receiving the Sacrament do so to their benefit and not their harm (1 Corinthians 11:27-30), and that the oneness that is expressed in receiving the Sacrament is genuine and not contrived (1 Corinthians 10:17).\nReception of Holy Communion is an expression of unity and fellowship with others who receive it.\u00a0 How do we know that those who receive the Sacrament are united in the faith with one another?\u00a0 We certainly cannot look into their hearts, but we can hear their common confession of faith.\u00a0 That is where church membership enters the picture.\u00a0 We see church membership as a way in which Christians acknowledge Jesus before others (Matthew 10:32) and publicly indicate their unity in faith and doctrine with fellow believers.\nDoes this practice \u201cguarantee\u201d that every person, without exception, \u201cis truly partaking in Communion in the manner Christ intended?\u201d\u00a0 No.\u00a0 That is not our assertion.\u00a0 We cannot control the attitudes of others\u2019 hearts.\u00a0 What we can do is see to it that, as far as humanly possible, those receiving the Sacrament in our churches will be partaking in Communion in the manner Christ intended, and will be providing a genuine picture of unity.\nOn the last day Jesus will acknowledge his followers\u2019 fruits of faith (Matthew 25:31-40).\u00a0 Faithfulness to the Lord\u2019s word describes what fruits of faith are all about.\u00a0 If you have not had any face-to-face conversations with a WELS pastor about this subject matter, I would encourage you to do that.\u00a0 Christian fellowship is a wonderful blessing (Psalm 133:1)."}
{"prompt": "Transubstantiation", "completion": "I've read that a (major) difference between Catholic and Lutheran theology is the doctrine of transubstantiation. At first glance, the Lutheran and Catholic approach to Holy Communion seem to be quite similar. Could you explain?\n\n\nThe Catholic church believes that only priests ordained by bishops in communion with the Pope or in the apostolic succession of the Eastern church have the power to consecrate the bread and wine so that they become body and blood of Christ and that nothing of the substance of the bread and wine remains, only body and blood. They also believe that the elements remain Christ\u2019s body and blood even after the mass is over. The elements can be reserved in a special place. The elements can be bowed to and prayed to. They believe the mass is a sacrifice. They also curse everyone who does not accept this view.\nWe believe that, together with the bread and wine, Christ\u2019s body and blood are truly present, however, this does not depend on papal ordination but on Christ\u2019s institution. We do not accept the adoration (worship) of the host, nor do we believe that a sacrifice takes place. We stick just to what the Words of Institution say."}

{"prompt": "Lutheran and Catholic", "completion": "My sister (raised WELS Lutheran) married a Catholic man over ten years ago. She has continued as a WELS member, and he as a Catholic. They have gone back and forth attending Lutheran and Catholic churches over the years, but haven't officially joined one (they have moved several times). They just recently had their third child - the first was baptized Lutheran, the second was baptized Catholic, and the third is going to be baptized Catholic. Is it better for one of them to convert and raise their family under one denomination? Or, do they remain separate? \n\n\nYour questions about faith are very important, and your concern for family members is commendable.\u00a0\u00a0 I can address your questions, and you can then determine what your concern for family leads you to do.\nFor starters, we want to understand what happens when churches baptize.\u00a0 A Trinitarian baptism brings a person into the Holy Christian Church.\u00a0 That says much more than someone was \u201cbaptized Catholic\u201d or \u201cbaptized Lutheran.\u201d\u00a0 Baptism brings a person into the Christian Church.\nBut churches do more than baptize; they teach.\u00a0 And at some point, baptized individuals are given the opportunity to profess the teachings of the church that has taught them.\u00a0 Confirmation, for example, is a time when individuals profess that the teachings they have learned from their instruction in the Lutheran Church are the teachings of the Bible and are correct.\nObviously, the teachings of churches differ.\u00a0 In your question you are referencing the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church and the Lutheran Church.\u00a0 A key is understanding that the differences between the churches are teachings\u2014doctrines\u2014and not \u201cphilosophies.\u201d\u00a0 A major difference of doctrine is the way of salvation.\u00a0 Is salvation God\u2019s gift, offered freely through his Son Jesus Christ, and received in faith?\u00a0 Or, is salvation a combination of faith and works?\u00a0 Those questions paint a picture of the huge contrast between Lutheran teaching and Roman Catholic teaching.\nIf a husband and wife hold to these different beliefs, a great unity in marriage is missing.\u00a0 \u201cMixed\u201d marriages like that might \u201cwork well,\u201d as you indicated, but how so?\u00a0 Often, they \u201cwork well\u201d in that husband and wife are loving toward each, they raise obedient, respectful children and outwardly they have a happy home life.\nBut marriages like that do not \u201cwork well\u201d when it comes to spouses trying to worship and commune together, and providing unified spiritual direction to their children.\u00a0 What \u201cworks\u201d much better is when husband and wife have a common faith and a common membership.\nI do not know what your sister and her husband have done to examine the teachings of their churches.\u00a0 They would benefit greatly from a study and discussion of what each church teaches about the Bible.\u00a0 There are several books from our publishing house that could assist them in that study.\u00a0 Keep in mind also that our churches regularly offer no-obligation Bible Information Classes, where people can receive an overview of the Bible\u2019s teachings and answers to their questions."}
{"prompt": "Annullment and separation", "completion": "Is there such a thing as annulment of marriage in the Lutheran church? What are the grounds for it? Also, while I know what the Bible says about divorce, provided both partners in the marriage stay faithful to their vow and don't get involved with another person romantically, is legal separation permissible and acceptable if the main motive is to resolve the issues that are causing problems in the marriage and the other goal is to get back together as soon as possible? \n\n\nIn the Lutheran Church there is no provision for an ecclesiastical or theological annulment of marriage. This means that we do not recognize any Biblical basis for declaring that a marriage that took place never really existed, theologically speaking. Roman Catholic marriage annulments are based on church laws and decrees, not the Bible. We do well, however, to distinguish a \u201ctheological\u201d annulment from a legal, civil annulment. A civil annulment is part of the laws of the state in which you live and those rules are distinct and clear. A civil annulment declares that while a marriage took place, it was illegal and will not be recognized as valid. If an already married person gets married to another spouse \u2014 that is, when bigamy results, \u2014 the second marriage is declared illegal and void.\nA formal separation, whether established legally or merely agreed upon by the partners, is a legitimate action as described and with the purposes stated by you. 1 Corinthians 7:5 establishes that kind of pattern, although with a distinctly different purpose (to devote yourselves to prayer) and also with the reminder that separations may bring with them other pressures (unfulfilled sexual urges). To seek a formal separation by mutual consent as described by you cannot be classified as wrong. But this should be done carefully, cautiously, with ongoing appraisals of the situation, and renewed resolve to deal with issues in anticipation of reunion. Pastoral counseling and perhaps other professional supervision is advised."}
{"prompt": "Interracial marriage", "completion": "Does the church ever preach against racism? I have been in interracial marriage for almost six years. My husband and I are both Christians and love each other very, very much. I have two beautiful stepdaughters as well. My marriage is a blessing and God meant for my husband and I to be together. Yet, my parents and brother have totally disowned my own nuclear family because of their race/ethnicity. I have been married almost six years and they have never even met them. My parents and brother have been faithful WELS members for decades. \n\n\nYes, the pastors of our churches preach against racism and they preach on the topic of marriage.\u00a0 Sermon texts have different focuses and our pastors preach on the basis of the content of the sermon texts.\nOur pastors preach that God\u2019s will is:\u00a0 \u201cLove your neighbor as yourself\u201d (Matthew 22:39).\u00a0 Racism runs contrary to that command.\u00a0 Our pastors preach that God instituted marriage and that marriage is to be a lifelong union between a man and a woman (Genesis 2:21-24; Matthew 19:3-6).\u00a0 There are no scriptural prohibitions of interracial marriage.\nWhat our pastors preach and what some church members may think are not necessarily the same.\u00a0 That seems to be your situation and that is unfortunate.\u00a0 All I can really do from a distance is encourage you to reach out to your family and see if you can re-establish lines of communication.\u00a0 If they really have sinful attitudes, that needs to be addressed.\u00a0 Perhaps enlisting a friend, another family member or their pastor would be helpful in getting the conversation started.\u00a0 I wish you and your family well."}
{"prompt": "Eloping and civil ceremonies", "completion": "What does the Bible say in regard to getting married by elopement or quick marriage in a courthouse and then doing a renewal of the vows at a later date?\n\n\nThe Bible says nothing at all about the place (church or courthouse) or officiant (pastor or judge) for the establishment of a marriage. This is fully in the realm of Christian freedom and therefore subject only to Christian love, wisdom and discernment, and a concern for how other believers might perceive it (in case the weak might stumble spiritually and misunderstand). Marriage is really a civil matter, but Christians usually want to have the Word of God and prayer prominent at the occasion. So clergy (authorized by the civil authorities to perform weddings) and churches serve them.\nThe mention of elopement and civil weddings often causes the subject of motives and circumstances to surface. These deserve the attention of every bride and groom and their respective families. Are they avoiding church and God\u2019s Word for a particular reason? Are they honoring their parents or hiding something from them? These and other similar questions are deserving of attention. But assuming that Christian faith, hope, and love are present and accounted for, civil marriages are just fine. And a later \u201cconsecration of civil marriage\u201d can be done and will likely be appreciated by all Christians involved."}
{"prompt": "Role of husband and wife", "completion": "What does the Bible say about the role of husband and wife? Is the man the boss of his wife in a marriage?\n\n\nThe simplest answer is: \u201cNo.\u201d\nYes, Scripture speaks of the husband as the head of the wife (Ephesians 5:23), but that is vastly different from what is often meant when we speak of a \u201cboss\u201d in our culture.\nIn what way?\nIs the man as head more important than his wife, on the top position on the totem pole of important people in the family? No. A Christlike head knows that in importance before God, there is no difference between male and female since both are equally redeemed and valued in the blood of Christ (Galatians 3:26-29).\nIs the man as head able to make sure that what happens around the house is what he wants to happen, regardless of the wishes of his wife? Is he the \u201cking of his castle?\u201d No. A Christlike head knows that he is not called to lord it over or dominate his wife, but he is called to love and serve her as Christ loved the church\u2014making her needs and concerns his first priority, just as Christ did for us (Mark 10:42-45; Ephesians 5:25-28).\nHeadship in Scripture is, at its heart, humble leadership that has as its prime concern the spiritual and physical welfare of all others whom God has placed in that head\u2019s care. Headship is not perk and privilege; it is an awesome responsibility to be God\u2019s representative in caring for others. Yes, there is a bit of Christ\u2019s authority whenever God gives someone such a position of responsibility, yet that authority is not to be used as a club or a threat. That authority is a solemn trust from God to be used for the benefit of those in our care. It is a trust that needs to be exercised wisely as those who will give an account to God for the trust he placed in us as his representatives.\nWhere we fail in that, we run to Christ\u2019s forgiveness. There at his cross, we find the strength of his grace to live out this awesome responsibility of being representatives of his selfless love in our homes.\nOne last thought: please notice that in Ephesians 5 Paul does not address husbands about being the head. He does not tell them to make their wives submit! He speaks instead to wives and urges them to respect their husband\u2019s headship. When Paul does speak to husbands, what does he say? He speaks of sacrificial love patterned after Christ. As husbands, we have more than enough to concentrate on right there. If we carry out that self-sacrificing love well for the spiritual and physical needs of our wives, we will have carried out headship well."}
{"prompt": "Not married", "completion": "In 1 Corinthians 7 and Matthew 19 we read about the gift of continence. How does one know if one has this gift? I am single and so far all my attempts to find a life companion have failed. Would this be an indication that I should turn my mind to choosing to \"live like an eunuch for the sake of the kingdom of heaven\"?\n\n\nIn 1 Corinthians 7 the apostle Paul expressed gratitude that God had gifted him with the ability to have self-control in sexual matters and not \u201cburn with passion\u201d (1 Corinthians 7:9).\u00a0 For that reason, Paul explained that the single life suited him well.\u00a0 For others who did not have that gift of self-control, he saw the benefit of marriage, furnishing opportunities for sexual intimacy to take place without sin being involved.\nDo you have that gift, you wonder?\u00a0 You have to ask yourself how content you are with your present circumstances.\u00a0 You have to ask yourself to what extent, if any, sexual temptations confront you and how you deal with them.\u00a0 The apostle Paul made it clear that the single life he experienced was not for everyone.\u00a0 For those who do not have self-control in sexual matters, he advised marriage.\nThere is so much about your situation that I do not know\u2014your age being one of the most important pieces of information.\u00a0 I say this only for information\u2019s sake:\u00a0 I know individuals who did not marry until later in life\u2014some in their 50s.\u00a0 They were content with their lives apart from marriage and were not going to marry just for the sake of being married.\u00a0 I commend them for that attitude.\u00a0 When we recognize that God\u2019s design for marriage is to be a lifelong union, we do best in being very deliberate in how we approach it.\nYour questions definitely deserve a fuller and more personal response.\u00a0 For that reason I would encourage you to speak to your pastor about these matters.\u00a0 God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Is divorce forgiveable", "completion": "Is divorce a forgivable sin according to the Bible?\n\n\nI do not know what prompted your question, but in an attempt to give an adequate answer, I will stress three things: First of all, divorce does involve or give evidence of sin, real sin, on the part of one or both of the marriage partners seeking the divorce. God\u2019s revealed will and desire is that marriages be lifelong.\nSecond, the sin or sins normally connected with a divorce are certainly forgivable. Christ paid for all sin and God delights in pardoning all sinners. The personal enjoyment of forgiveness, of course, assumes that the sinner is brought to repentance and thus takes both the sin and the work of the Savior seriously. Only a lack of repentance and a willful despising of the gracious working of the Holy Spirit in unbelief fit the \u201cunforgivable sin\u201d category.\nThird, some have been observed saying that, despite all this, divorce is sometimes treated as though it were unforgivable. This may stem in part from pastors and spiritual leaders striving to stress the seriousness of this sin coupled with its epidemic spread in our society. There are seldom any real winners, only losers, in a divorce. This may also stem from the popularity of what has been called \u201cplanned repentance\u201d in divorce cases. This means that people willfully and wrongly seek a divorce with the conscious plan of \u201crepenting\u201d afterward, after the deed is done. Biblically speaking, that is not the pattern of true repentance. \u201cRepentance\u201d that is humanly planned and produced is not the real thing and is not accompanied by forgiveness."}

This brought up a discussion in our family of what are the biblical grounds for divorce. I've read abuse could be considered malicious desertion and could be grounds for divorce. But I wasn't quite able to determine what exactly was meant by this. I would appreciate some clarification if possible.\n\n\nBeyond physically deserting a spouse, the Bible does not specifically list other ways in which malicious desertion can take place (I Corinthians 7:15).\u00a0 As malicious desertion is characterized by sins that are unilateral, willful and permanent, it could take the form of physical or emotional abuse, refusal to have sexual relations with one\u2019s spouse, or refusal to support the spouse financially.\u00a0 Because of the complexities of relationships, Christian discernment and pastoral counseling are essential when it comes to determining malicious desertion."}
{"prompt": "Seventh-Day Adventists", "completion": "What are the beliefs (briefly) of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church and how do their beliefs compare to the teachings of WELS?\n\n\nIn the SDA statement of \u201cFundamental Beliefs\u201d (http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/fundamental/index.htm), you\u2019ll find many fine things with which we would agree completely. Here are some of the SDA distinctives that we find troubling, however:\n\nPerhaps the \u201ctrademark\u201d SDA emphasis\u2013the teaching that, at Creation, God established Saturday as a mandatory day of rest for his people of all time (compare Colossians 2:16-17). In SDA practice, there is a strong streak of legalism\u2013i.e., the view that life with God is fundamentally about \u201ckeeping the rules\u201d instead of about faith in Christ\u2013in other matters, too. \u201cThe rules\u201d have included strictures about diet, tobacco, alcohol, appropriate apparel, jewelry, tithing, etc.\nBaptism is a confession of faith (compare Titus 3:5), not a means of grace; and it must be performed by immersion.\nThe bread and wine in the Lord\u2019s Supper are \u201cemblems\u201d of Jesus\u2019 body and blood, not the real thing. Jesus also instituted foot-washing as a lasting ordnance for his church.\nThe writings of Ellen G. White (1827-1915) are an authoritative source of teaching alongside the Scriptures. The Church in General Conference session may also be led by the Holy Spirit to revise its teachings still further.\nIn 1844, Christ in the sanctuary in heaven began a work of \u201cinvestigative judgment\u201d\u2013i.e., the work of determining which of those who have died were righteous and may participate in the Resurrection at Christ\u2019s coming. When he comes, the \u201cmillennium\u201d will begin, which is explained as a 1,000-year reign of Christ with his believers in heaven (during which time the earth will be occupied only by Satan and his angels). Christ and the believers will return to earth at the end of this period, the earth will be cleansed, and this renewed earth will be the home of believers forever.\n\nA word should be said, however, about the SDA\u2019s many admirable educational and charitable endeavors all around the world. Additionally, there has been something of an \u201cevangelical movement\u201d within the SDA in recent times that has led them to put more emphasis on Jesus\u2019 forgiveness and less on \u201cthe rules.\u201d We pray it will continue."}
{"prompt": "Peter the first pope?", "completion": "Was Peter the first Pope? Please explain WELS' take on the Catholics' assertion that he is. Thank you!\n\n\nThere is no biblical or historical basis for the claim that Peter was the first pope.\u00a0 While the Roman Catholic Church might like to use Matthew 16:18 to support their belief that Peter was the first pope, those words say nothing of the sort.\nWe actually find a play on words in Matthew 16:18.\u00a0 Peter\u2019s name in Greek is petros.\u00a0 It is a masculine noun.\u00a0 When Jesus said he was going to build his church \u201con this rock,\u201d the word translated \u201crock\u201d is petra, a feminine noun.\u00a0 Petros refers to a rock, while petra has in mind a rocky cliff or ledge.\u00a0 The Greek makes it clear that Jesus spoke of building his church not on a person, but on a rock-solid confession of him as the Son of God and the promised Savior.\nIn addition, Jesus did not tell Peter that only he was given the keys of the kingdom of heaven (Matthew 16:19).\u00a0 Jesus explained that all Christians possess the keys, the authority to forgive sins or retain sins (Matthew 18:15-20)."}

{"prompt": "Coexist symbols", "completion": "I am seeing Coexist t-shirts and bumper stickers. (These are bumper stickers that spell out the word \u201ccoexist\u201d using symbols from various religions including Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, Wicca, and Christianity \u2013 all in an effort to promote religious tolerance.) As a Christian, how should I react to this symbolism, and how can I witness to someone who displays this?\n\n\nThe popular and often-used \u201ccoexist\u201d symbol merits our attention, appraisal, and thoughtful response. The symbol itself was originally a plea for religious tolerance, and today the focus has been somewhat broadened. The symbol is normally used to promote the idea that different religions, value systems, ways of life, and points of view should exist harmoniously and peacefully. This is a plea for tolerance and peaceful coexistence as opposed to open strife, war, and political or social oppression based on differing religious, moral, or ideological convictions.\nYou ask how Christians should best react to the symbol and to those who display it on their clothing, vehicle, or another personal possession. I believe that the Christian\u2019s response will be more complicated and thoughtful than a simple \u201cI like it\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t like it\u201d vote. For example:\n\nFirst, we do well to ask the people what the symbol means to them and why they display it. Don\u2019t assume the worst in regard to their motives. They may or may not have given much thought to displaying it. Or they might be sick and tired of all the bloodshed, oppression, and social or political persecution that has stemmed from differing religious and ethical standards. They may not be expressing approval or disapproval of any of the religions or ideologies represented in the symbol, but they like the idea of mutual courtesy or a peaceful coexistence that has little to do with religious convictions. But sometimes the people who display the symbol knowingly seek more than a peaceful coexistence. They may wrongly believe that all religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism) or all lifestyle choices (homosexuality and lesbianism, pacifism) are equally valid or worthy of our allegiance. We will want to clarify what they do and why they do it.\nWe also wisely appraise our own kind of \u201cChristian tolerance.\u201d Christian tolerance displays a kind and patient treatment of the persons and motives of others even if or when we disagree or reject their false principles and opinions. We seek to treat the people with kindness, even when they embrace error that we hate and despise as poison to their souls. Christian toleration maintains a love for those in error and seeks points of contact that may be used to witness to the truth and against the error.\nThen we strive to witness to the other people, reacting to their expressed motives, convictions, and understanding of issues involved. We may warn, encourage, rebuke, commend, and inform or teach \u2014 and sometimes we do\u00a0all of these things depending on what we have learned from the people. We cannot approve or endorse error or falsehood in religion or morality. We can love and seek the well-being of the people to whom we witness. We can share accurate information to serve souls and enlighten minds. And we can be prepared for a variety of reactions, from appreciation to ridicule, from gratitude to hatred. But we are called on to continue to speak and react by speaking the truth in love.\nAnd if we do not have opportunity to speak with those who display the symbol because they are in moving vehicles or walking in a crowd, we can include them in our prayers and intercessions. We ask God to guide them into the truth centered in Jesus Christ just as he has graciously guided us."}
{"prompt": "Immunizations", "completion": "A few fellow WELS members in our church choose not to immunize their children. I have some concerns because we have a Christian day school and my children also attend there. Some of the members who choose not to immunize have made their beliefs public and one even went as far as using a website that says God does not want us to immunize. This website states that immunizations contain fetal parts from aborted fetuses. I am wondering if there is any direction from the WELS about immunizations? Thanks.\n\n\nWhat I can do is refer you to the web site of Christian Life Resources.\u00a0 Searching \u201cvaccination\u201d and \u201cimmunization\u201d will yield numerous results of reading material.\nAdditionally, I can pass along the response to a previous question on this topic before I began service as the responder to questions.\u00a0 The question submitted was:\u00a0 \u201cIs there anything stated in the Bible on vaccines? Some say that things that are added to some of these vaccines could be harmful. Is there anything in the Bible that helps us decide whether it is right or wrong to vaccinate our children?\u201d\nThe response was:\u00a0 \u201cVaccinations did not occur until the end of the 18th century so it is not spoken of directly in Scripture.\u00a0 Scripture does provide principles that guide our view of vaccinations.\n\u201cFour objections to vaccinations are commonly raised:\n\u201cObjection # 1: Vaccinations represent a failure to trust the providence of God as the Great Physician and Protector.\nYes, we are to trust God (John 14:1), but we are also to be responsible stewards of God\u2019s blessings (Matthew 25:31ff; Romans 2:6; 14:12).\u00a0 Vaccinations are one way we protect our lives.\u00a0 In the same way we protect our lives by looking both ways before crossing the street.\u00a0 We make decisions and take precautions to keep our lives and the lives of others safe.\u00a0 Does looking both ways represent no trust in God?\u00a0 Of course not!\n\u201cWe make reasonable efforts to protect God\u2019s blessing of life.\u00a0\u00a0 If deemed safe and effective, vaccinations would be such a reasonable effort.\u00a0 Furthermore, as the Christian reflects his greater concern for others (Philippians 2:3-4) he or she will want to weigh the potential danger to others of contracting a disease or illness because we chose not to be vaccinated.\n\u201cObjection # 2: Immunizations were unethically developed.\nIt seems fairly certain that some immunization were unethically developed and/or tested.\u00a0 For example, evidence suggests that the vaccines for Hepatitis A, chicken pox and MMR (mumps, measles and rubella) were cultured in cells taken from children aborted in the 1960s.\u00a0 The concern is that by availing oneself of such an unethically developed vaccine we condone or lend credibility to the unethical way it was developed.\n\u201cScripture teaches us that we are all sinful.\u00a0 Our righteous acts are comparable to filthy rags.\u00a0 For that reason, sin is a component in the development of anything in our world.\u00a0 A house may have been built 50 years ago by a builder who cheated a subcontractor out of some money.\u00a0 Do we see living in that house 50 years later as condoning the dishonesty?\u00a0 Our automobile may have been designed by stealing secrets from another manufacturer years ago.\u00a0 Can we now not drive that vehicle?\n\u201cSin taints everything in this world.\u00a0 The solution is not to cut ourselves off from all things but rather to work to right the wrongs.\u00a0 If vaccines were developed unethically, Christians will want to get into positions of influence to stop such unethical research.\u00a0 Speak against the sin not the results.\u00a0 If you cut yourself off from anything touched by sin what then do we have that has never been touched by sin?\n\u201cObjection # 3: Immunizations can be dangerous.\nIn most developed countries there are regulations requiring strict testing to assure the safety of vaccinations.\u00a0 Yet, there always seems to be exceptions.\u00a0 Thousands of people may have no negative effects from a vaccine and then someone gets seriously ill or dies from the same vaccine.\u00a0 Ever since statistical analysis caught foothold back in the early 1800s people \u201cplay the odds\u201d on the safety of things.\u00a0 How safe is driving, flying, sailing and walking?\u00a0 Everything has an element of danger.\u00a0 Christian freedom affords latitude for making such judgments on the relative safety of a vaccine.\u00a0 In this country statistics usually demonstrate a vaccine to be very safe before it goes to market.\u00a0 If you have an acquaintance, however, who had trouble with a particular vaccine your judgment will be skewed.\u00a0 In an imperfect world there is always the possibility of an error.\u00a0 Use your best judgment.\n\u201cObjection # 4: Immunizations can encourage irresponsible lifestyles.\nIn 2007 the Texas governor ordered all girls entering the sixth grade to have the HPV vaccine.\u00a0 The vaccine prevents the HPV virus which is a sexually transmitted infection that can lead to cervical cancer.\u00a0 The concern some people had was whether giving the vaccine to a young girl would encourage promiscuity.\u00a0 Will immunization enable \u2018safe sinning?\u2019\n\u201cSinful people have an uncanny ability to twist what were meant as blessings into something reckless or sinful.\u00a0 We take more risks when we have a safety net or harness.\u00a0 We place our lives at greater risk if we feel we have a better car, better boat or better safety gear.\n\u201cAs God provides ways to preserves our lives and well-being, those methods are genuine blessings.\u00a0 Hearts devoted to God receive those blessings with thankfulness and purity.\u00a0 Our sinful nature, however, will continue to find ways to corrupt God\u2019s blessings for selfish pursuits.\u00a0 We appreciate God\u2019s blessings and we use His Word to hold the line on our wayward tendencies.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Favoritism with children", "completion": "Can you give my some guidance on what the Bible says about a parent who favors one child over the other? My husband has an obvious favorite in our three children and it really bothers me. I feel like he is greatly discouraging our other two children. \n\n\nI grieve over your concern and can imagine how unsettled you must be as a Christian parent who seeks only the best for your husband and children.\nBased on your question, I will have to assume that (1) your husband really is showing favoritism with your children and this is not just your imagination, (2) your husband is aware that you observe and disapprove of this (rather than his being clueless or utterly ignorant about what\u2019s happening or how it\u2019s happening), and (3) he is your Christian brother as well as your husband, that is, Bible guidance will be meaningful to him.\nYou could give Bible examples of favoritism (like Jacob favoring Rachel over Leah or Joseph and Benjamin over their siblings) and show how this never results in healthy family relationships. It asks for trouble and is pretty sure to get trouble. But this approach doesn\u2019t bring the power to change hearts, since it is basically a law approach rather than a gospel one.\nI recommend that you point your husband repeatedly to the attitude and actions of his dear heavenly Father and Lord Jesus. Such love! Such a gracious Giver of every good gift. And your husband is on the receiving end of all that. No more and no less than anyone else, \u201cfor God so loved the world . . .\u201d And your husband\u2019s high calling in Christ is to imitate God (Ephesians 5:1-2), to be more and more like Jesus (Romans 8:29). And God shows no favoritism (Acts 10:34, Romans 2:11, etc.). The hope is that your husband will grow in his understanding and appreciation of all that God has done to redeem him graciously and pardon him freely. And that he will be led to be more and more like God, in rejecting partiality and favoritism as inconsistent with Christian lifestyle as well as wise parenting.\nAlso, keep pointing your children to the same grand truths. This applies to them too. As they grow and mature they will increasingly find that their highest security and emotional balance will rest on the unmovable promises of a faithful God who delights in them even when earthly representatives may fail them."}
{"prompt": "Homosexual child", "completion": "As parents of an adult homosexual child, how much of a relationship should we maintain with our child and friend? We do not want him to think we condone this homosexual relationship, but we still love him and feel he needs our Christian influence. We also do not want our young grandchildren to think this is okay.\n\n\nYou have my sympathy as you strive to maintain relationships with your homosexual child and friend. I am thankful that you DO desire to maintain a relationship since that will allow you opportunity to give suitable witness to your convictions and to demonstrate parental kindness despite\u00a0the spiritual plight of your loved one. I recognize that your doing this will necessarily involve awkwardness, often leave you in situations where you will be unsure of how best to conduct yourself in Christian love, and periodically arouse anger and resentment in your child and partner because of their impenitent lifestyle. And you will grieve over the inaccurate and flawed example that will be set before your grandchildren on a daily basis. You have a daily petition in your prayer life until repentance is shown.\nYou ask \u201chow much of a relationship\u201d should be maintained. There are no strict formulas to follow. Christian love is keenly alert to specific relationships, opportunities, threats, and people\u2014and expresses itself with flexibility as long as divine truth is not compromised. You have already identified key issues and voiced proper concerns, so I suspect you will do just fine despite awkwardness and emotional pain. Perhaps all I can counsel is that you maintain clarity in your testimony as you speak the truth in love. Clarify what you cannot and will not accept and why you at the same time desire to maintain a relationship with your child. Take every opportunity your child gives you while being content when your child gives you precious little opportunity. And maintain the cheerfulness that comes with the confidence that God does not desire to be done with your child and that he does not have the limitations imposed on you. In your intercessions ask God to work miracles, to use other witnesses for the truth to interact with your child, and commend your child confidently to divine providence that can crush the rebellious spirit and make sinners open to the truth. The pressure is ultimately on God, not you, just as the power is his, not yours or mine."}
{"prompt": "Placing a child for adoption", "completion": "Is it wrong to put a child up for adoption? What are circumstances, if any, when a Christian may give up a child for adoption?\n\n\nIt is not wrong to place a child for adoption. It is, however, often a painful decision. Within the Christian context there are two ways to look at it: biologically and beneficially. The biological perspective is that parents have a responsibility to raise their own children (Isaiah 49:15) or to entrust them to immediate family when they cannot (Exodus 2:1-9). The beneficial perspective focuses on benefiting the child\u2019s needs.\nThe Bible presents a clear, general directive: love God and love others (Matthew 22:37-40); family members head the list of \u201cothers\u201d whom we are to love (1 Timothy 5:8).\nGod consistently describes the immediate family as mother, father, and child(ren). This is the ideal setting for raising children (Ephesians 6:1,4). Where there is no mother or father because of death or divorce, other family members and friends often take an active role in helping to raise the child(ren). Sadly, when a child is born outside of marriage, the child\u2019s mother often is left to raise the child alone.\nWhen is it appropriate for a child to be placed for adoption? Because the biological mother often is the one facing this decision, let\u2019s use her perspective.\nShe typically is alone, perhaps young, poor, or facing some malady that makes it difficult for her to raise her child. Her decision often is complicated by an emotional attachment or a sense of biological duty. But she needs to remember God\u2019s command to be more mindful of others than of herself (Philippians 2:3-4), prayerfully consider whose welfare is being best served, and what is best for her child physically and spiritually.\nIt isn\u2019t wrong to place a child for adoption with someone else if there is reasonable assurance that God\u2019s directive on how to raise a child (Proverbs 22:6) will be met and that the child will learn about Jesus as Savior and Lord (2 Peter 3:18).\nBirth mothers often describe making this difficult choice as \u201cplacing\u201d their child for adoption. They view it not as a surrender but as an important parenting decision they are making for their baby."}
{"prompt": "Straying child", "completion": "What can parents do if an adult child strays away from the faith? Our daughter quit going to church when she was in college. She is now in her mid-twenties, still will not go to church, and does not want to talk to us about it. \n\n\nOur sincere sympathy goes out to you parents. The grief that Christian parents of a backslidden child endure is great. This heartache is compounded when parental control is diminished or lost because the child has become an adult and is able to silence or willfully ignore and despise the testimony of the parents. In general you have three tools at your disposal:\n\nYou can pray. Keep your daughter in your intercessions. Ask God to act providentially to get and keep her attention and interest (even if it be through severe trials). Ask him to supply Christian witnesses to law and gospel who may be given access to her when you have been shut out. Ask God for the ability to continue to love her\u00a0and have confidence regarding her return to repentance and faith, rather than growing bitter or despondent because of your disappointment.\nYou can offer clear though limited testimony to law and gospel when opportunities surface. Your daughter may not want to \u201ctalk about it\u201d but if you promise not to engage in an ongoing dialogue every time you see her (which is perhaps what she fears most because of a guilty conscience), you can ask her for one sit-down conversation at which time she can explain to you what she feels and why and you can explain to her what you feel and why. And in that kind of setting, law as law and gospel as gospel will be your primary tools as you sow the seed of God\u2019s Word.\nYou can continue to testify to your daughter by attitude and lifestyle that she will observe. Here I am thinking of a cheerful, happy contentment and optimistic approach to daily life that gives Christ all praise and holds no grudges to those (including children) who disappoint or embrace ideologies contrary to your own. Continue to feed and fuel your own faith-life through the gospel, and as you grow spiritually you will also grow in your ability to cope with this disappointment, trust God\u2019s capabilities despite your limitations, grow more fervent in prayer, and ultimately serve as a billboard of Christian contentment and joy for people (including your daughter) who have temporarily at least settled for much less. The goal is to attract them winsomely to the Lord who gives his people, in addition to pardon and eternal life in glory,\u00a0such blessings despite hardships during our earthly pilrimage."}
{"prompt": "Infants at church", "completion": "What are the benefits of bringing infants to worship?\n\n\nYou ask for benefits, and I offer this as a partial list of perceived benefits derived from bringing infants and small children to public worship gatherings:\n\nThis allows the Holy Spirit to enrich the child as the Spirit wills, even though we may not know precisely how. (The words of 2 Timothy 3:15 as well as Matthew 18:6 tell us that the smallest among us may nevertheless believe and know the Bible in some way (aside from the blessings of Baptism). While we may not grasp the how, we eagerly anticipate the Spirit giving what he wants to give, however he chooses.)\nThis, in time, trains a child in the basics of church etiquette and decorum while in public assemblies when people are gathered around God\u2019s Word and sacraments. This takes time and repetition, but it yields results we give thanks for by the time a child is a bit older.\nThis is a fine way of testifying to the world that our families are all God\u2019s people and belong wherever God\u2019s people gather for worship. This gives joy to fellow worshipers as they behold the next generation of believers beginning their participation in worship assemblies and gives encouragement to visitors and newcomers who have children and see that their entire families are welcome. This encourages our own members with small children and tells them that despite potential disruptions and distractions, their whole family is welcome, and we consider the training of the youngest a high enough priority that we are willing to endure some distraction ourselves.\nThis gives fellow worshipers opportunities to lend a hand periodically to assist busy and sometimes frustrated parents who are engaged in the important but challenging process of training their youngest. Problematic situations are often opportunities for practical love and kindness to spring into action.\nThis allows the congregations to ponder and develop ways of serving parents who often find it hard to concentrate on the Lord\u2019s law and gospel during worship assemblies. The provision of tools and encouragements for home study or mid-week study may be a part of this.\n\nWhile a longer list is possible, I\u2019ll pause merely to say we are not blind to the challenges are potential problems involved here. It is little wonder that so many churches provide suitable nursery areas and so many deacons and ushers are trained to offer alternatives when infantile outbursts threaten the hearing of God\u2019s Word for many in attendance. Let us strive to strike a suitable balance here. Life this side of heaven will always bring challenges to accompany blessings from our God."}
{"prompt": "Prayer and Bible study", "completion": "Sometimes when I am struggling with something, I will say a prayer asking God to show me what I need to hear, and then I will open the Bible and see what it says on the pages I opened up to. Sometimes it seems to fit the situation and be encouraging, sometimes it doesn't seem to fit, and sometimes it is discouraging. Is it okay to do this? And am I just missing God's point when I don't see how it fits my situation?\n\n\nSometimes people do not know where to start reading in the Bible, so they do what you describe. They say, \u201cLord, show me where you want me to read\u201d and randomly open their Bible and start reading wherever the Bible happens to open. This has long been known as the \u201clucky dip\u201d method. The Lord could give blessing in this way, but we have no promise (or Bible example) that he will. In general it is not the best way to read his Word.\nTo show some of the dangers in the \u201clucky dip\u201d method, consider the following illustration that has been around for generations: The story is told of a man who used this method. The first verse he happened to turn to was Matthew 27:5 which says Judas \u201cwent\u00a0away and hanged himself.\u201d Since he was not sure how this verse applied to himself, he flipped to another passage and the Bible fell open to Luke 10:37: \u201cJesus told him, Go, and do likewise.\u201d The man was quite upset and he did not know how he could ever obey that, so he decided to turn to one more place. Again he opened the Bible at random and to his horror his finger fell upon John 13:27: \u201cWhat you are about\u00a0to do, do quickly.\u201d Each of the verses are taken out of their context and end up giving messages that are not helpful or suitable.\nHere are a few encouragements that have been around a long time. They point to a better and richer way to use the Bible.\n\nRead systematically. When we read a book, a story, a letter or an essay, we generally start at the beginning and read through until we get to the end. This is how the writer wrote it, and this is the best way to read it. The same should be true with the books of the Bible. The best way to read is to start at the beginning of a book and continue until you get to the end. When Paul wrote the book of Romans, he did not write chapter 13 first and then chapter 8. He began with chapter 1 and then wrote chapter 2, etc. Shouldn\u2019t we read it this way to enjoy his message?\nRead carefully. Pay close attention to each word. Be careful not to let your mind start to daydream. (To check this you can always ask yourself: What did I just read?)\nRead inquisitively. As you read the Bible, be asking questions such as these: Who is the author or speaker? To whom is the passage written or who is the speaker addressing? What are the main ideas? Other key questions that will help to bring out the meaning of the passage as are follows: Is there any command to obey? Is there any promise to believe? Is there a good example to follow? Is there any sin to avoid? Do I learn anything about God? Do I learn anything about humans\u2014me? Is there anything I can thank God for?\nRead lovingly. Think of a young woman in love with her fianc\u00e9 who is separated from her by many miles. How do you suppose she would read his love letters? As soon as the letter arrives in the mail she would open it and read it all the way through with great interest. Then she would likely read it again, this time slowly. She would think about every word. She would lovingly meditate upon every phrase and think to herself, \u201cI wonder why he said this?\u201d Even after she finishes reading the letter she would remember much of what was contained in the letter and she would continue thinking about it throughout the day. Read the Bible in that way! The Bible is God\u2019s love letter to us.\nRead prayerfully. Trust the Holy Spirit to teach you. Make it a habit to pray before you read. Psalm 119:18 is a good example of such a prayer. It is the Lord that gives understanding (2 Timothy 2:7). In this way the reading of God\u2019s Word may serve as a constant source of joy and wisdom to your heart!"}
{"prompt": "Why Pray", "completion": "If God is going to do His will according to the plan He has for you, what's the point of praying?\n\n\nWe pray because God invites and directs us to pray to him (Matthew 7:7; Luke 18:1; Ephesians 6:18; 1 Thessalonians 5:17).\u00a0 We pray because God promises that he will hear and answer our prayers (Psalm 50:15; 91:15; John 15:7).\u00a0 We pray because God tells us that prayer is \u201cpowerful and effective\u201d (James 5:16).\u00a0 That same section of James illustrates how God acted on Elijah\u2019s prayers.\u00a0 We have many reasons to pray to our God.\nYour question addresses the kinds of prayers that we call \u201cpetitions,\u201d prayers in which we make requests of God.\u00a0 You know that we utilize prayer for other reasons though.\u00a0 We pray to God to give thanks to him.\u00a0 We pray to God to communicate, among other things, our thoughts, our fears, and our concerns.\u00a0 Prayer is finally communication with God.\u00a0 As we communicate with other people daily on a variety of issues and subjects, so we have opportunity to converse with God about the issues of life\u2014and to do that daily.\nWe may not understand all the mysteries of God\u2019s will, but this part of his will we do know:\u00a0 he wants us to employ the privilege of prayer.\u00a0 God speaks to us through his Word, and through prayer he makes it possible for us to speak to him.\u00a0 He wants us to pray, and he delights in our prayers.\u00a0 \u201cThe prayer of the upright pleases him [God]\u201d (Proverbs 15:8)."}
{"prompt": "Sign of the cross", "completion": "Hello! Is it OK that I do the sign of the cross before and after I pray? Also, may I ask why do we say, \"In your Son's name\" or \"In Jesus' name,\" etc.? Thanks!\n\n\nMartin Luther would be happy with your practice of the sign of the cross.\u00a0 In his Small Catechism (in the Concordia Triglotta) he included this preface to the Morning Prayer:\u00a0 \u201cIn the morning, when you rise, you shall bless yourself with the holy cross and say:\u00a0 In the name of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.\u00a0 Amen.\u00a0 Then, kneeling or standing, repeat the Creed and the Lord\u2019s Prayer.\u00a0 If you choose, you may, in addition, say this little prayer\u201d [which we know as Luther\u2019s Morning Prayer].\nSimilar wording precedes his Evening Prayer:\u00a0 \u201cIn the evening, when you go to bed, you shall bless yourself with the holy cross and say:\u00a0 In the name of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.\u00a0 Amen.\u00a0 Then, kneeling or standing, repeat the Creed and the Lord\u2019s Prayer.\u00a0 If you choose, you may, in addition, say this little prayer\u201d [which we know as Luther\u2019s Evening Prayer].\nMaking the sign of the cross\u2014in the morning, in the evening, before and after prayers\u2014is purely optional for Christians.\u00a0 God does not command nor forbid it.\u00a0 (We call that an adiaphoron).\u00a0 If that practice is beneficial for you in that it reminds you that you are a redeemed child of God, maintain it.\u00a0 Of course, ask yourself the reason why you have that practice.\nAs far as praying \u201cin Jesus\u2019 name,\u201d we use those words in our prayers, or we pray with that attitude without using those specific words, because we recognize that it is only through Jesus that we can approach our God in prayer (John 1:12; 14:6; 16:23; Galatians 3:26-27; Ephesians 3:12)."}
{"prompt": "Church bells and Lord's prayer", "completion": "I grew up in a WELS church that had a church bell that they rang every Sunday at the beginning of the service, then they tolled the bell 3 times during the Lord's Prayer. Could you tell me the meaning behind the Lord's Prayer toll?\n\n\nI grew up with a similar experience.\u00a0 Medieval monks are credited with the custom of ringing a bell three times during the Lord\u2019s Prayer.\u00a0 The idea was to alert people in the area surrounding the monastery or church that the Lord\u2019s Prayer was being spoken in those buildings and they could join in from a distance.\u00a0 The bell peal at the beginning, middle and end of the Lord\u2019s Prayer helped those distant prayers keep pace with those who were praying the prayer inside the buildings.\nToday that custom of ringing the church bell three times during the Lord\u2019s Prayer has largely lost its practical function in our society, but it still adds beauty and dignity to our worship.\u00a0 And, like the ringing of the bell at the start of the worship service, it is a reminder to the church\u2019s community that corporate worship is taking place.\u00a0 One of our hymns puts it this way:\u00a0 \u201cBells still are chiming and calling, Calling the young and old to rest\u201d (CW 529:1).\u00a0 Jesus wants to give the weary rest for their souls (Matthew 11:28), and so we invite sinners to find rest for their souls through the gospel\u2014even inviting them by the ringing of church bells."}
{"prompt": "Praying to Mary and Saints", "completion": "Why don't we ask Mary (the mother of Jesus) and dead Saints to pray for us as well as praying to Jesus? Is there somewhere in the Bible that says we shouldn't or that somehow Jesus' mother is not an important person?\n\n\nThe fact that a person is important has nothing to do with whether we are to pray to that one. People living\u00a0on earth can do things to help us, but only God can answer prayer. The first commandment forbids us to worship and pray to anyone except God. To pray to any person as we pray to God is idolatry.\nThe dead in heaven cannot hear us. They are removed from the earth, so it does no good to pray to them. Also,\u00a0there is no need to pray to them. We can pray directly to God as Jesus taught us in the Lord\u2019s Prayer. When we can pray to God himself, why would we want to pray to a man or woman?\nJesus is God. The dead saints are just that\u2014dead saints. Why would we pray to dead saints (even those in heaven) when we can pray to the living God who invites our prayer and promises to hear us (Psalm 50:15)?"}
{"prompt": "Praying for others", "completion": "I have two loved ones who are battling cancer, and I don't know how to pray for them. Do I ask for their healing even though it looks grim? I know God's will is already known to him . . . so do I ask for a miracle? How and what do I pray to our Lord for?\n\n\nThere is no doubt that the Lord is presenting you with some challenging situations. Knowing how to pray is not always an easy task. We want to accept God\u2019s will and his providence over our lives and the lives of our loved ones. But we realize that he also invites us to pray.\nWe may wonder why God does this, especially if he knows what he is going to do anyway. Here we simply have to trust that our prayers do make a difference because God says they do. He tells us that \u201cthe prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective\u201d (James 5:16). Hezekiah even gives us an example of how God altered his course of action because of the prayer of one of his people (Isaiah 38). Our prayers make a difference. They play a part in God\u2019s governance of the world.\nLet\u2019s explore what God\u2019s Word says about how we should pray. The Lord invites us to \u201ccall upon him\u201d (Psalm 50:15) and to \u201ccast all our anxiety on him\u201d (1 Peter 5:7). Jesus adds, \u201cMy Father will give you whatever you ask in my name\u201d (John 16:23). Although it may sound as though Jesus is giving us a blank check, we understand his words alongside of other sections of Scripture where God teaches us that we always pray with the attitude, \u201cNot my will but yours be done\u201d (Matthew 6:10; James 4:13-15). However, these passages do point out that we are to pray with confidence, knowing that we can ask for anything and that God will hear that prayer and consider our request. In Philippians 4:6 the apostle Paul states, \u201cDo not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.\u201d\nYou certainly have some matters that are weighing heavily on your heart and mind. God invites you to bring these matters to him in prayer. He also adds that you can ask for what may seem impossible recognizing that what may seem impossible to us is possible for God (Matthew 19:26).\nConsidering these passages, it is appropriate for you to pray for a miracle in the lives of your loved ones. You can pray that the Lord will heal them from their cancer. But as you pray for this miracle you accept the fact that God may not work a miracle in this case. This does not mean God did not hear your request. It does not mean that God did not answer your prayer. God always hears our prayers and answers them. But when he doesn\u2019t give us what we want, he gives us something better. That is not always easy to understand in this life. We may not see how God is giving us something better by allowing a loved one to suffer through an illness and perhaps even die from that disease. Yet we have his promise that he will do what is best for us and our loved ones."}
{"prompt": "Praying for a miracle", "completion": "Is it okay to pray for a miraculous healing?\n\n\nIt is proper to pray for healing and to ask your pastor or a fellow Christian to join you in such prayers. Nowhere has Scripture declared that divine healings have ceased, nor has Scripture anywhere advised that we should not include such matters in our prayers.\nIt is wise, however, to have realistic expectations. Not all the sick and dying were healed when our Lord served among people, and not everyone was healed among the apostles or those they served. Paul was denied healing of a physical ailment he asked to be removed (2 Corinthians 12:8-10), Paul\u2019s coworker Epaphroditus almost died and was not quickly healed (Philippians 2:25). Trophimus was not miraculously healed (2 Timothy 4:20), and Timothy was instructed to use medicinal remedies rather than being healed (1 Timothy 5:23). God has always been selective and has not given a guaranteed promise of miraculous healing to his dearly loved people. Since the time of the apostles, the phenomenon of miraculous healings has apparently substantially decreased in number. Perhaps this is because one of the purposes of miracles is no longer needed. Originally God provided them to substantiate the trustworthiness and truth of the Apostolic New Testament (Mark 16:20).\nWhen you pray for healing, do so as a humble child of God and ask that God\u2019s will be done\u2014and tell him you pray that healing is indeed his will. Ask confidently, knowing that he is not only fully able to heal but also able to sustain you in illness and use sickness for your spiritual and eternal good as well as for his glory."}

{"prompt": "Living together versus marriage", "completion": "Why is marriage a better option than living together?\n\n\nMarriage, like love and procreation, is a life enhancement created by our heavenly Father. He made Eve to complete the creation of man, brought her to Adam, and joined them as husband and wife. The unconditional union of a man and a woman in marriage for as long as they both live is his design (Genesis 2:24). It has his approval and blessing (Genesis 1:27-31).\nAmong the blessings that our loving Father intends for married couples are companionship, sexual happiness, chastity, and children (Proverbs 18:22, Hebrews 13:4, Psalm 127:3).\nIn addition, he protects and cares for marriage in a variety of ways\u2014not only by treating it as a lifelong union, but by forbidding sexual activity outside of this bond and by clarifying the role relationships of a husband and his wife.\nHis design for marriage is that a husband love his wife and sacrifice himself for her, motivated by the love that Christ has shown for both of them (Ephesians 5:25-28, 1 Peter 3:7). His plan also is that a wife love and respect her husband in the same way that she shows her love for Christ (Ephesians 5:22-24, also see Ephesians 5:33). If a marriage relationship is blessed with children, he intends that fathers take a leading role in bringing up their children as Christians (Ephesians 6:4).\nOur present marriage laws recognize public, present consent, not cohabitation, as that which establishes marriage. This reflects what Scripture says also. Most cohabitating couples in the United States do not regard or refer to each other as husband and wife and are not legally married no matter how long they live together.\nEven though our unbelieving society embraces living together outside of marriage as an acceptable lifestyle, it is still a sinful arrangement. A pastor or congregation will deal patiently with cohabitating people who are seeking spiritual guidance or if they are new Christians who are just beginning to grow in their Christian life of sanctification. This is done by firmly yet gently confronting them with their sin, comforting them with the joy of forgiveness and eternal life through Christ, and then guiding them to change their behavior to show their love for Christ."}
{"prompt": "Spouse and child relationships", "completion": "What scriptural passages might show that a marriage is superior to a parent child relationship?\n\n\nI do not know the context of the question, so I will not attempt to place one blessing of God above another.\nMarriage is certainly a blessing from God.\u00a0 He instituted it, and through it he wants to bless people\u2019s lives.\u00a0 Through the lifelong union of a man and woman God provides intimate friendship, companionship and the proper place for sexual activity.\u00a0 The Bible describes the close relationship between spouses as \u201ctwo becoming one\u201d (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:6). According to his goodness and will, God enables spouses to become parents, as he blesses them with the gift of children.\u00a0 If, in his wisdom, spouses are not able to have children, they still enjoy the blessing of their relationship with one another.\nHow special is this relationship between husband and wife?\u00a0 It is one that the Bible uses throughout to describe the intimate union between Christ and the Christian Church.\u00a0 Christ is the bridegroom and the Church is the bride (cf. Revelation 19:7; 21:2).\nChildren are also blessings from God (Psalm 127:3).\u00a0 They provide parents with joys and responsibilities\u2014chief among them is the responsibility to bring up their children \u201cin the training and instruction of the Lord\u201d (Ephesians 6:4).\u00a0 The bond of love between parents and their children, their own flesh and blood, or their children by adoption, is one that is strong and enduring.\nHow special is this relationship between parent and child?\u00a0 It is one that the Bible uses throughout to describe God\u2019s love for sinners like us (Psalm 103:13; Isaiah 66:13).\nBecause marriages are sometimes childless, and because children do come into the world outside marriage, I hesitate placing one blessing of God over another."}
{"prompt": "Premarital dating and sex", "completion": "How far is it acceptable to go, sexually, with a Christian partner? I have been dating my boyfriend several years, and though we are not officially engaged, we plan on getting married. We both believe strongly that sex should be reserved until marriage, but what about more physical acts, if done purely out of love for each other and not just for physical gratification?\n\n\nCompetent pastoral counsel normally requires that the person offering counsel knows personally the people being counseled. In a question like yours, this is especially true. You and your boyfriend should be speaking with your pastor. Here I can only share general information that should be of some help to you, but cannot take the place of face-to-face pastoral counseling.\nAttitude is everything, as they say, and aside from your shared reliance on Jesus Christ as your Savior and Lord (the highest attitude), you do yourselves a favor by pondering passages like these very seriously and discussing them very straightforwardly: Ephesians 5:3-5; Colossians 3:5,6; Hebrews 13:4,5; and 1 Thessalonians 4:1-5. God has high standards for his dearly loved people, quite different from the standards of our culture.\nHere are additional observations to consider:\nThe Bible does not explicitly answer your \u201cHow far is it acceptable to go?\u201d kind of question largely because our culture\u2019s style of courtship was not prevalent in Bible times. Back then, the\u00a0normal marriage age, parental involvement in spouse selection, more consistent mores in society, and more firm civil penalties helped to safeguard young people from inappropriate external behavior\u00a0to a greater degree than the customs that\u00a0prevail today. So don\u2019t expect the Bible to give you an explicit answer in so many words.\nThere are so many dividends to premarital chastity. These include (1) maintaining a clear conscience before God, (2) fostering a mutual respect with each other, (3) developing a stronger relationship, and (4) avoiding or minimizing potential spiritual offense to others. All of these inevitably point\u00a0to being content and seeing the wisdom of less sexual activity rather than more. A Christian conscience should be actively testifying to this as well.\nTo maintain an appropriate level of ethical premarital activity, the following points may be useful:\n\nConsciously and openly discuss and express the degree of commitment/propriety.\nCommunicate and maintain agreed on limits that reflect a high view of love, respect, and responsibility.\nSeek out and plan situations and company to prevent undue difficulties and temptations (Remember the \u201cflee\u201d word in 1 Corinthians 6:18 and 2 Timothy 2:22).\n\u201cForeplay\u201d is just that, so don\u2019t do it. Recall the principle of diminishing returns.\nUpon engagement, set a realistic wedding date. Avoid what will soon be regretted.\nDo not forget the enduring gifts of grace: repentance and forgiveness, prayer and new resolve to a life of holiness, perseverance and character through trials.\nIf a moral lapse occurs, repentance and forgiveness remain as divine gifts. Do not assume that marriage must follow for this reason. Do not let the sin fester for years; it will."}
{"prompt": "Alzheimers and faith", "completion": "What does the Bible tell us about those with dementia or Alzheimer's? Will we see them in heaven? How do we know if they still believe in God's saving grace?\n\n\nThe Bible says nothing directly or explicitly about dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s. Ironically, the strong majority of references to the aged, a frequent target of these diseases, view old age as a blessed time of life. The subject of the loss of mental capabilities through diseases like dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s does not surface in the Scriptures. I have heard the words of Jesus to Peter in John 21:18 applied to people suffering from this kind of malady, but in context the words refer to physical martyrdom, not disease or a loss of physical or mental capabilities.\nYour primary concern is the really important one: do these diseases rob a believer of saving faith in Jesus Christ or give us cause for concern about their faith-life until death? Here we happily report that saving faith is not at all the same as mental knowledge, or the ability to memorize and articulate information about the Savior, or even the power to memorize and repeat truths about Jesus to other people. Faith is ultimately the product of the Holy Spirit who creates and maintains reliance on Jesus Christ in a person\u2019s heart.\nUsually this work of the God involves the accompanying use of a person\u2019s mental and emotional abilities, as in the study and learning of the Word of God. The Holy Spirit uses the written and spoken gospel to give and sustain saving faith. But he is also fully able to work saving faith in infants and small children through the instrument of Baptism; and this divine, gracious working is beyond our ability to comprehend. It is also beyond our ability to discern or recognize with our senses. But because God promises that infants and little children can indeed be brought to saving faith (see Matthew 18:6,10 and Acts 2:38-39) we take him as his word and entrust the little ones to his care. Similarly, we do the same with those who have been rendered unable to express themselves or articulate their Christian faith as they once could.\nOur convictions and comfort rest on divine promises rather than empirical evidences that this is so. God is faithful and will not abandon his people despite the ravages of disease."}

{"prompt": "Importance of Sola Fide", "completion": "As I understand, the Lutheran view is Faith=Salvation and Salvation brings about Good Works. The Roman Catholic view is that Faith + Good Works = Salvation. In both cases, you have Faith, Works, and Salvation. Why is the difference so important? I know Luther was concerned that he could not do enough good works, but that is not everyone's concern. I realize that this is a huge Lutheran/Catholic division, but it seems like a very small point. Why is the distinction so important, since we end up at the same point (with Salvation, Faith, and Works) in both cases? Thank you.\n\n\nWhat an important question!\u00a0 You are correct in understanding that works enter into the teachings of both churches, but the motivation for doing those works is entirely different.\nThe teaching of the Bible is that we are saved only by God\u2019s grace through God-given faith (Ephesians 2:8-9).\u00a0 Scripture makes it clear that we are saved by God\u2019s works, not ours (Titus 3:4-6).\u00a0 More than that, the Bible emphasizes that we can lose out on salvation by trying to add anything to Jesus\u2019 saving work.\nThe book of Galatians addresses that very situation.\u00a0 A group called the Judaizers was telling the Galatians that faith alone was not enough for salvation, and that their obedience of certain parts of God\u2019s law was also necessary for their salvation.\u00a0 The apostle Paul addressed that situation by condemning the teaching of the Judaizers and warning the Galatians that they were jeopardizing their salvation by thinking they could contribute to their salvation by their obedience of the law.\u00a0 Rather than pointing out specific passages from Galatians, I would encourage you to read the epistle\u2019s six chapters to see how strongly Paul condemned the teaching of the Judaizers and pointed the Galatians to look to Christ alone for salvation.\nMotivation for keeping God\u2019s law, again, is the key to understanding the differences between official Roman Catholic Church and Lutheran Church teachings on the subject of salvation.\u00a0 The difference in motivation can be illustrated by asking:\u00a0 am I trying to keep the Ten Commandments to try to get something from God (forgiveness of sins, salvation) or give something to God (praise, gratitude)?\u00a0 If I\u2019m trying to get something from God (as in contributing to my salvation), I will realize like Luther that I can never do enough.\u00a0 The law of God demands perfection, and all of us fall woefully short of that standard.\u00a0 If I\u2019m trying to give something to God through my obedience to his law (giving him my praise and gratitude for his gift of salvation), then I understand the role of good works.\u00a0 Those works flow from saving faith and comprise a big \u201cthank you\u201d to God (Colossians 3:17).\u00a0 Thank you for your question."}
{"prompt": "Good works", "completion": "What is the relationship between faith and good works? Are good works necessary for salvation, even if it's only indirectly? \n\n\nArticle IV of the Formula of Concord takes up your question in great detail. When Scripture says that God saves people who \u201cdo not work\u201d (Romans 4:5), and that he saves us \u201cnot by works\u201d (Ephesians 2:8-9), \u201capart from observing the law\u201d (Romans 3:28), \u201cno longer by works\u201d (Romans 11:6), and \u201cnot because of righteous things we had done\u201d (Titus 3:5), etc., the answer becomes clear. Our good works are not \u201cnecessary for salvation\u201d in any way, shape, or form\u2014directly or indirectly, wholly or in part, before or after we are saved, etc.\nBut this doesn\u2019t make good works \u201coptional\u201d for a Christian. One reason is that God still commands them. The Bible\u2019s teaching of justification by faith alone does not turn the 10 Commandments into the 10 Suggestions. Through our good works, we worship and glorify our Savior God (Romans 12:1-3). We show that our faith is alive and well in front of others, who can\u2019t see our faith but can see the actions that faith produces (Matthew 5:16). And through our good works we love and serve other people.\nAs Lutherans like to say, God doesn\u2019t need our works, but our neighbor does. \u201cGood works are necessary for salvation\u201d would be a false statement. \u201cGood works are necessary\u201d is true\u2013not for salvation, but for plenty of other reasons."}
{"prompt": "Athanasian creed", "completion": "I am currently working my way through the Book of Concord. As I read through the Creed of Athanasius I questioned the last part about giving account of our deeds and that those who have done good deeds will have eternal life and those who have done evil will go into eternal fire. Isn't this contrary to the basis of Christian faith of salvation through grace in Jesus Christ?\n\n\nWhat a wonderful and worthwhile reading project you have!\u00a0 Your question is one that many people ask when they read the Athanasian Creed.\u00a0 Your question also demonstrates the value of providing an explanation\u2014in the service folder or by way of verbal announcement\u2014when congregations use the Athanasian Creed in a worship service.\nThe section of the creed you cited reflects the language of Scripture regarding God\u2019s judgment of humanity (Matthew 16:27; John 5:28-29; Romans 2:6-10; 2 Corinthians 5:10).\u00a0 God certainly judges what is in the heart.\u00a0 It is faith in Jesus Christ alone that saves, and it is unbelief that condemns (Mark 16:16).\u00a0 Salvation is entirely God\u2019s doing; we do not contribute to our salvation in any way (Romans 3:28; Galatians 3:11; Ephesians 2:8-9).\nWhat Scripture does explain is that saving faith and condemning unbelief manifest themselves in people\u2019s lives.\u00a0 And so on the last day, the Lord will point out the good works that Christians have done and the sins that unbelievers have committed (Matthew 25:31-46).\u00a0 Those good works of Christians were not the payment for their salvation; the good works were the evidence of Spirit-worked saving faith in Jesus who paid the penalty for their sins.\u00a0 The sins of unbelievers will be singled out because they rejected the only means of forgiveness for their sins.\nWhat the parable of the sheep and the goats illustrates is that God will demonstrate how fair a judge he is.\u00a0 He judges what is in the heart.\u00a0 A person cannot see into the heart of another as God can, so God will provide the evidence for the judgment of the heart that he made.\nOnce again, that parable shows us that on the last day no sins of believers will be brought up.\u00a0 That is because there are no sins to bring up; Christians enjoy complete forgiveness of sins through faith in Christ.\u00a0 On the other hand, the sins of unbelievers will be mentioned because they cannot do good works (Romans 14:23) and, because they have rejected the only means of forgiveness, their sins condemn them.\nWe could think of the section in the Athanasian Creed (\u201cThose who have done good will enter eternal life, but those who have done evil will go into eternal fire.\u201d) this way:\u00a0 \u201cThose who believed in Jesus as their Savior\u2014and saving faith always produces visible fruit\u2014will enter eternal life, but those who rejected Jesus\u2014such people cannot perform good works, nor do they enjoy forgiveness of sins\u2014will go into eternal fire.\u201d\nKeep up your reading and study!"}
{"prompt": "Miscarriages", "completion": "Do miscarried babies go to heaven?\n\n\nYou are asking a question that is often asked and that fills us all with strong emotions. And perhaps the reason why it is so often asked is that the Bible does not explicitly give us an answer, and we then end up emotionally dissatisfied. We rejoice at every mention of people being baptized and receiving the promises of faith and forgiveness and hearing the gospel and being brought to trust Jesus and becoming citizens of heaven. We also grieve because so many in this world do not enjoy these blessings and feel particularly bad when we could not apply the gospel to some people like miscarried or stillborn children.\nRegarding miscarried children we must affirm that they, like everyone else, were conceived in an inherited sinful condition and need forgiveness to be saved. We also affirm that Christ is the only revealed Savior for all mankind, regardless of the specific circumstances that prevail from person to person. On the basis of clear Scripture, then, we understand that they need faith in Christ and that faith in Christ is given by God through the Gospel. In saying this we do not wish to be understood as saying God could not create faith in people\u2019s hearts aside from the gospel (recall the amazing work of the Holy Spirit with John the Baptist when he was still a fetus, Luke 1:41-44), or could not have devised other ways and means for doing it if he had seen fit to do so. We merely report that God throughout Scripture reveals that he works through the gospel to create faith and that this faith is necessary for personal salvation.\nIt would be presumptuous for us to assume that miscarried children are nevertheless headed for heaven. This idea is not based on Scripture. It is quite popular and emotionally pleasing, of course, and we fully understand the motives in adopting such a position. However, we bind ourselves to Scripture alone for doctrine and simply say that there are things we do not fully understand and cannot fully explain \u2014 and this subject is one of those. To say it bluntly, here we are in the realm of the unsearchable judgments of God. That is where we should leave this kind of speculation.\nWe are given the assurance that God is a compassionate God, whose judgments are fair. \u201cThe Lord is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love. . . . He does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities. For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him\u201d (Psalm 103:8-11). We make this the basis of our convictions about what is fair or not fair; whatever God does is fair and right, and good. What \u201cseems fair\u201d to our limited minds and emotions is not to be made the standard of truth.\nThe way a person seeks to respond to a question like yours tells us a lot about how that person does theology. If we limit ourselves to Scripture alone, we do not have a lot to say. We will stress what God has graciously revealed to us and admit our limitations. And we will recommit ourselves to witnessing and the support of mission work. But if we are willing to manufacture other answers that strike us as reasonable or emotionally satisfying, lots of ideas are possible. I sincerely pray that we never take that route, but commend these issues to the gracious Lord who will answer our questions when we get to glory. \u201cFor we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears. When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me. Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.\u201d (1 Corinthians 13:9-12)."}
{"prompt": "Saving Faith", "completion": "Hi there. I am inquiring into the WELS Lutheran faith. I know that different denominations have different meanings for saving faith. The Catholic Church's teaching is believing everything the Catholic Church teaches. Baptists say it is the sinner's prayer asking Jesus into your heart.

I want to become a Christian right now. I have never been to church a day in my life. Thank you so much!\n\n\nSaving faith is a complete reliance upon Jesus Christ for salvation.\u00a0 When the panic-stricken jailer in Philippi asked, \u201cWhat must I do to be saved?\u201d he received the answer:\u00a0 \u201cBelieve in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved\u2014you and your whole household\u201d (Acts 16:30-31).\nFaith in Jesus Christ saves because that faith is attached to the One who lived a holy life in our place and who suffered the punishment our sins deserved.\u00a0 Jesus lived up to his name, which means \u201cSavior.\u201d\nWhile saving faith consists of knowledge and one\u2019s assent to that knowledge as being true, the most significant and important component of saving faith is trust and reliance on Jesus Christ alone for salvation and not on our works of the law.\nGod works Christian faith in people through his powerful gospel; Christian faith is a gift of God (Romans 10:17; 1 Corinthians 12:3; Ephesians 2:8).\u00a0 No one decides to become a Christian.\nChristian faith, finally, is living and active, on display in everyday Christian living (cf.

Does this mean one is not meant to be saved or was never truly a Christian? \n\n\nAs you rightly say, the Bible affirms that believers are indeed \u201cnew creatures\u201d in Christ. 2 Corinthians 5:17 and Ephesians 2:10 use this kind of language. The Bible\u00a0also affirms, as does our experience in living as believers, that we remain sinners with a sinful nature, weakness of faith, and spiritual challenges when we\u2019re\u00a0tempted to sin or doubt God\u2019s promises. Passages like Romans 7:15-25 and Hebrews 12:1-12 testify to this ongoing reality.\nYou ask \u201chow\u201d this can be, and you\u00a0seem to be making a logical deduction that if someone is \u201ctruly\u201d saved or \u201ctruly a Christian,\u201d then a kind of sinless perfection should immediately result in our thought patterns and lifestyles. That may be logical, but it is not biblical or true. It is a false conclusion to be cast aside. The Christian life is one of warfare against sin and Satan and against\u00a0our own sinful nature that opposes God\u2019s will and is indeed a terrific cross to bear this side of glory. This struggle\u00a0is also used by God for disciplinary purposes to further our progress in Christian character and endurance when coupled with an active use of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nHistorically, some have emphasized the passages about our being \u201cnew creations\u201d to the exclusion of those passages that speak of our continuing sinfulness (despite our being justified or forgiven in Christ) and have taught a kind of so-called \u201cperfectionism\u201d or \u201ccomplete sanctification\u201d set of ideas. We believe that is false. Instead, we teach that ALL Bible truths are to be received and embraced rather than adopting some while denying or distorting others. We heartily invite you to accept the same understanding.\nAbove all else, focusing on your final words, we urge you\u00a0to stop\u00a0thinking you are not a true believer simply because you still contend with weaknesses and sins on a daily basis. Continue to focus on Christ\u2019s perfect work on your behalf, rejoice in the unconditional declaration that you are 100% forgiven for his sake, and do not see your sins as clear evidences of unbelief. A focus on Christ and the unconditional good news of his saving work will also strengthen you in your daily battles against sin. We do not expect perfection this side of heaven, but we do expect and may enjoy progress and growth in godliness."}
{"prompt": "Types of sin", "completion": "Are some sins worse than others?\n\n\nSince God created us to love him perfectly, and to love our neighbor as himself, any failure to love in heart, word, or action is the equivalent of shattering the whole law of God. James tells us that in the second chapter of his epistle, \u201cFor whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it\u201d (2:10). Every one of my sins is lawless rebellion against the God who created me to be a perfect reflection of his love in this world. Every failure to live in love is a damnable rejection of his purpose for our lives. In that sense all sin is equally evil. It is all equal evidence that we have a nature within us that is exactly the opposite of what God created us to be.\nBut for the believer in Christ, there\u2019s more to the story. Because we stand forgiven and holy in God\u2019s sight through the perfect life, death, and resurrection of his Son, every sin does not instantly make an unbeliever out of us. As we live in repentance that runs each day from the evil of our sin to the cross of our Savior, we find that \u201cthe blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, purifies us from all sin\u201d (1 John 1:7). Through faith in Christ we stand in God\u2019s grace (Romans 5:1-2).\nHowever, if we grow careless about sin we are inviting spiritual disaster. If, when we become aware of sin in our hearts and lives, we continue in that sin and begin to excuse and defend it, then we are in danger of allowing sin to rule in our hearts again just as it did when we were unbelievers. To persist in what we know to be sin, will soon drive the Holy Spirit and faith from our lives. Paul warns us in Romans 8:13, \u201cIf you live according to the sinful nature, you will die.\u201d In that sense, stubborn and willful sin is more dangerous to our faith than sins of weakness or ignorance from which we run to his cross as soon as we recognize them. That\u2019s true even though all sin is by nature damnable in and of itself.\nThis sounds a bit paradoxical but here is the truth: if we treat sin as the evil it is and run to our Savior\u2019s gracious arms, it cannot harm us. Christ has paid for them all! But if we treat sin as harmless and defend and excuse it, then we are giving that sin the power to destroy us all over again.\nAll of this isn\u2019t about categories of sins (\u201cbig ones\u201d and \u201clittle ones\u201d), as if we could make two lists of different \u201ctypes\u201d of sins. The difference is the attitude of our hearts toward sin. Are we clinging to our sins or are we clinging to our Savior?"}
{"prompt": "Bible and Premarital sex", "completion": "I know that sex before marriage is a sin, but where is this clearly stated in the Bible? When approached with this question previously, the only verses I could recall refer to \"sexual immorality\" or \"adultery.\" Where is premarital sex defined as adultery and sexual immorality?\n\n\nInstead of seeking a Bible verse that explicitly says something like, \u201cSex between two unmarried people is sin,\u201d you would do better to approach the whole issue as the Bible does. God establishes marriage and then says to those being joined together in marriage that they are to be intimately united and that they also become one flesh (see Genesis 2:24 and Matthew 19:5). Thus two things are linked to marriage: union (the intimate joining of a man and a woman as husband and wife) and becoming one flesh (sexual, physical intimacy too). To become one flesh (have sexual union) aside from this marriage bond is never allowed and never spoken of as God-pleasing. It is, however, clearly identified as wrong, as sin (see 1 Corinthians 6:15-18, for example). Any use of the gift of sex aside from the marriage bond is adultery, whether this is premarital or extramarital. God has graciously provided for the sexual desires of men and women to be satisfied only in marriage. To engage in premarital or extramarital sex, before or outside of marriage, is to sin in God\u2019s sight. That is precisely the point of Hebrews 13:4, a verse often referred to in this kind of discussion.\u00a0 \u201cMarriage\u201d and the marriage bed (the Greek text only has the word \u201cbed\u201d) go together and are to be kept pure. Using the \u201cbed\u201d aside from \u201cmarriage\u201d is sin that God will judge.\nThe counsel given in 1 Corinthians 7:9 makes the same point. If a person has sexual urges and the sex drive (a good gift from God in itself) expresses itself within a person, that person has a God-pleasing remedy identified: to be married and thus obtain the right to be sexually active. Before or outside of marriage, sinful lust is sinful lust. Marriage partners may express the same desires for each other and there is no sin. This kind of \u201clust\u201d is not sinful. (The Bible word used here is also used for legitimate and proper strong desires, even though the English word usually always carries a negative idea).\nI suggest that you sit down with your pastor and seek additional clarifications if you wish more. He may also have resource material in his library that can be helpful to you as you seek to serve others who ask you about these things."}
{"prompt": "Made in God's image", "completion": "How would you respond to the idea that because Adam and Eve were made in God's image, so all people have God's image in them? Was God's image in Adam and Eve completely destroyed by their fall into sin, so they couldn't pass any parts of God's image on to the rest of the world? \n\n\nBeing created in the image of God meant that Adam and Eve were holy, they had perfect knowledge of God\u2019s will, and their wills were entirely aligned with God\u2019s will.\u00a0 After the fall into sin, the Bible tells us Adam had a child in his likeness and image, not God\u2019s (Genesis 5:1-3).\u00a0 Since the fall into sin, human beings born of sinful people have entered this world as sinners (Psalm 51:5), enemies of God (Romans 8:7) and people whose natural will is opposed to God\u2019s will (Romans 7:7-23).\u00a0 Despite this natural sinful condition, people still have a natural knowledge of God from creation and their conscience, and they naturally know the basics of God\u2019s law (Psalm 19:1-4; Hebrews 3:4; Romans 2:14-15).\nWhile there are some Lutheran theologians who speak of people still being made, in a limited sense, in the image of God insofar as they have intellect and will, it is more consistent with Scripture to say that the image of God was lost through the fall into sin and is restored in Christians.\nEphesians 4:24 instructs us to \u201cput on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.\u201d\u00a0 Colossians 3:10 has a similar directive:\u00a0 \u201c\u2026put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator.\u201d\nGenesis 9:6 and James 3:9 are passages that some theologians cite to indicate that after the fall into sin people are born in the image of God in a limited sense.\u00a0 When we understand the image of God especially denoting holiness and loving only that which God loves, then we see those particular passages speaking of the original condition of people, which is no longer the case because of sin.\nCertainly, each person receives life from God (Acts 17:25) and each person is the object of God\u2019s love in Christ (John 3:16; 1 John 2:2).\u00a0 Beyond those blessings is the working of the Holy Spirit in people\u2019s hearts through the gospel, connecting them to Jesus Christ and the salvation he won.\u00a0 In Christians the image of God is being restored (2 Corinthians 3:18; Ephesians 4:24; Colossians 3:10), and it will be fully restored when Christians leave this world of sin (Psalm 17:15; 1 Corinthians 13:9-12; 1 John 3:2)."}

It seems that you understand these truths and have taken them seriously. I am thankful for that.\nYou are, however, not enjoying other truths clearly revealed in the Bible for us all.

Your sin of adultery (and the subsequent divorce if that is also traceable to your sins) has already been forgiven. It was forgiven 2,000 years ago when the penalty for it was paid in full by Jesus Christ. He did this for you as part of a sinful world. The problem you are wrestling with is that somehow, and for reasons I do not know, you consider yourself an exception to the rest of us forgiven sinners. But you are not. Jesus Christ is your Savior from sin and guilt and eternal damnation.\nThis is a truth not to be argued, debated, or doubted. It is a truth to be trusted, a promise to be received. And your and my gracious, loving God leads us to trust this good news as we hear, read, or in any other way receive the message. \u201cFaith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ\u201d (Romans 10:17). So I counsel you to stop worrying about your sin, stop focusing on your burdened conscience and feeling of guilt, and go back to focusing on the objective and unchanging (and unchangeable) Word of God that declares you forgiven through Jesus Christ and his work for you.\nI also strongly urge you to sit down with one of our pastors and allow him to give you counsel that will properly reflect his personal knowledge of you and allow you to ask questions and share pertinent information that is not possible in this e-mail format.\nRich blessings to you as you do this!"}

{"prompt": "Sin and Repentance", "completion": "When we sin, do we always have to make an actual confession for that to be forgiven or do we just have to have faith that Jesus forgives us through faith in him (of course I'm not trying to provide an argument for license of sinning). And what happens when we sin, but we forget that we sin, yet we still keep faith in Jesus Christ? Would we be forgiven? And lastly the unforgivable sin?

Thank you and have a nice day.\n\n\nYou ask important questions.\u00a0 Let\u2019s review briefly what Scripture says about sin, forgiveness of sins, confessing sin, and the unforgiveable sin.\nAll people are guilty of sin (Psalm 14:3; Romans 3:23).\u00a0 Jesus Christ came into the world to forgive the sins of all people (John 1:29; 3:16; 2 Corinthians 5:18-21; 1 John 2:2).\u00a0 Through faith in Jesus Christ we personally enjoy the forgiveness Jesus won by his holy life and sacrificial death (Mark 16:16; John 5:24; Romans 5:1; 10:9).\u00a0 God does not dole out his forgiveness piecemeal.\u00a0 He has forgiven all our sins.\nSo why do we confess our sins?\u00a0 Because God directs us to do that (Matthew 6:12; James 5:16).\u00a0 God\u2019s will is that we confess our sins because a denial of sin and other wrong attitudes about sin are dangerous (Hebrews 10:26; 1 John 1:6-10).\u00a0 God\u2019s promise is that he hears the penitent cries of his followers and forgives their sins (I John 1:9).\nDoes this mean\u2014as you asked\u2014that you and I need to confess every sin in order to have forgiveness for every sin?\u00a0 No.\u00a0 We cannot possibly list all our sins.\u00a0 Sometimes we are oblivious to our own sins (Psalm 19:12).\u00a0 So we confess the sins we know, we confess our sins in general, we confess that we are by nature sinful.\u00a0 God\u2019s good news is that he has forgiven all our sins.\u00a0 We stand and live in his grace (Romans 5:2).\nThe unforgiveable sin that you asked about is mentioned in Matthew 12:31-32, Mark 3:29-30, and Luke 12:10.\u00a0 In Matthew chapter 12 we hear of Jesus performing a miracle.\u00a0 Those who witnessed the miracle wondered if Jesus was the promised Messiah.\u00a0 The Pharisees\u2019 reaction to that miracle was charging Jesus of being an ally of Satan.\u00a0 In Jesus\u2019 response to the Pharisees, he warned of \u201cblasphemy against the Spirit\u201d not being forgiven (Matthew 12:31).\u00a0 This unforgivable sin is often defined as blasphemous, vehement rejection of Christ, against better knowledge of the truth.\u00a0 The sin is unforgiveable because the person guilty of it cuts off the work of the Holy Spirit, who alone can change the heart.\nSo, where does this leave us?\u00a0 Think of what you usually do in a worship service:\u00a0 you confess your sins, you receive absolution, and in the Creed you say:\u00a0 \u201cI believe\u2026in the forgiveness of sins.\u201d\u00a0 What a gracious God we have.\u00a0 \u201cWho is a God like you, who pardons sin and forgives the transgression of the remnant of his inheritance?\u201d\u00a0 (Micah 7:18).\u00a0 Let\u2019s rejoice in the forgiveness of our sins and, when we sin, let\u2019s confess them to the Lord, knowing and believing that he has forgiven all our sins through Jesus Christ his Son."}

{"prompt": "God allowing homosexuality?", "completion": "Why do some people say that homosexuality was not in God's plan for us, and that it\u2019s a sin. I ask this question because there are a lot of individuals, men and women, who say that they've always been attracted to the same sex since they were kids. If it is a sin as some have preached and stated, why would God allow that to happen if he knew us before he came to be as he states in Jeremiah 1:5? \n\n\nWe say that homosexuality is not in God\u2019s plan for us and that it is a sin because that is what the Bible says. Jeremiah 1:5 is about God knowing his plan to call Jeremiah as his prophet. It says nothing about God approving every one as they are. Sin has made people into something God never intended them to be. The following statement summarizes our view on homosexuality on the basis of the Bible.\nThe dispute over whether homosexuality is an inborn disposition or a free choice, the national debate over the legalization of same-sex marriages, the conflict that is rising in many denominations over the ordination of practicing homosexuals, and the sharp disagreement about the blessing of same sex marriages by the church are among the current issues that may lead people to ask, \u201cWhat is WELS\u2019 stance on these issues?\u201d WELS does not have an official statement on these issues, but our public teaching and practice is based on what the Bible teaches concerning homosexuality.\nThe best place to begin a discussion of the issue is with 1 Corinthians 6:9-11, because this passage emphasizes both the law and the gospel elements of addressing this issue.\n\u201cDo you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders, nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.\u201d\nOn the basis of this and other passages of Scripture we must draw the following conclusions about homosexuality.\nScripture declares that homosexuality is a sin, which is contrary to God\u2019s intention in creating man and woman. Sinful resistance to the revealed will of God is a factor in this sin. People may become slaves to this sin (Romans 1:18-31, 1 Corinthians 6:9-10).\nMany factors contribute to individual acts of sin: the sinful nature we are born with, the weaknesses of our bodies, evil influences in our environment, temptations and encouragement from other sinners, and our own sinful choice join together lead us into sin. All of these factors contribute to homosexual sin. The proportionate role of these various factors may very from case to case.\nWe must warn the impenitent that homosexuality, like all sins, excludes people from eternal life (1 Cor 6:9-10).\nWe are happy to assure the repentant who are struggling against this sin that they have complete forgiveness through the blood of Christ. When Christ died for all of the sins of the whole world, he gained forgiveness for homosexual deeds, for homosexual desires, and for the inborn sinful nature which produces these sins (1 Cor 6:11).\nWe should sympathize with all who are struggling against this sin, remembering that we too have \u201cpet sins\u201d which may have a strong hold on us. We warn against a \u201cselective morality\u201d which harshly condemns homosexuality or other sins which we observe in others while treating those sins which are present in our own lives more lightly (Mt 7:1-5). We should be impartial and unbiased in warning against all sins.\nWe all look forward to the resurrection of the body. Then all the weaknesses of body and soul which now lead us into sin will disappear forever. Then all of us will be able to serve God perfectly and purely in everything we do.\nNote on Homosexuality as Innate or Chosen:\nSome advocates of legal and religious tolerance of homosexuality claim that homosexuality has a genetic cause. Some reports claim that some homosexual men share a particular pattern in the X sex-chromosome which they received from their mother. Other researchers have claimed the existence of other types of biological similarities between homosexual men. These researchers acknowledge that their discovery cannot account for all homosexuality and may merely be associated with homosexuality rather than being a direct cause of it. Most researchers conclude that the origins of homosexuality are complex and varied and may never be fully understood.\nHow should we evaluate such claims in the light of the biblical teaching of sin? Is homosexuality a free choice or an inborn tendency?\nLike many such either-or questions, this question poses a false dilemma. Every sin is both a choice of the will and the expression of an inborn tendency to sin. Our sinful will is guilty of consent whenever we sin in thought, word, or deed. As a result of our sinful nature we take pleasure in our sins and defend them. This universal tendency is apparent also in the efforts of gay rights activists to condone their homosexuality and to deny that anything is wrong with it.\nAlthough the consent of our sinful will is present in every sin, it is also true that we are born as slaves of sin. We may also yield to a particular sin so often that we no longer control the sin, but the sin controls us. We may find ourselves yielding to sin even when we don\u2019t want to.\nSin infects both our body and our soul. The body we now have is not the perfect body which God created for Adam and Eve. It has been contaminated by the effects of sin. There is no reason to maintain that the specific effects of sin have been identical in each one of us or that we are all equally susceptible to every sin. Our individual degree of susceptibility to some specific sins may be due in part to differences in our bodies. Abuse of alcohol and a hot temper are just two examples of sins which may be affected by the chemistry of our bodies. Few would deny that the pressure to sexual sin is greater at 18 than it is at 8 or at 88 and that a primary reason for this is the changing chemistry of our bodies. It may well be that a person\u2019s susceptibility to homosexuality or to certain other sins depends in part on bodily differences.\nEven though the weakness of our own body may be one factor which leads us to sin, God holds us responsible for all of our sins, even those sins which enslave us and those sins which we are not aware of. We need God\u2019s forgiveness even for those sinful desires which we resist and do not act upon. These desires too are sin. (Read Romans 7 for a treatment of slavery to sin)."}

In the very sad circumstance of having to choose to preserve one life rather than lose two lives, the weight of Scripture\u2019s message telling us to protect life compels us to try to preserve both lives, or at least one life, whichever is possible.\nAll other reasons for abortion fail to reflect God\u2019s high regard for human life and our responsibility to protect it.\nSince the majority of abortions currently performed show disregard for God\u2019s gift of life, we as Christians want to express concern and compassion for distressed, pregnant women by supporting the development of God-pleasing alternatives to abortion programs."}

It is a collection that includes many different kinds of material, but it is mostly known for its dreams and visions, in which Enoch is said to receive revelations about cosmology, wars between heavenly beings, and the last judgment.\nThe book seems to have been widely known in the last centuries BC and the first centuries AD.

Thank you.\n\n\nGod does bring people to saving faith and employs them in his kingdom at different stages of life.\u00a0 Jesus\u2019 parable of the workers in the vineyard (Matthew 20:1-16) illustrates that.\u00a0 That parable especially highlights the truth that Christians, no matter when in life they may have been called to faith, enjoy equally the blessings of salvation.\nYour questions seem to address the situation of a person who is baptized early in life and then grows \u201cin the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ\u201d (2 Peter 3:18).\u00a0 If you were baptized early in life, you \u201chad a relationship\u201d with God from that point on.\u00a0 That relationship consisted of being part of the family of God (Galatians 3:26-29).\u00a0 As you grew older, your knowledge of the Scriptures increased and your faith deepened.\u00a0 Not surprisingly, different events in life can take place that lead us to appreciate all the more the relationship God established with us.\u00a0 For example, one of the reasons God allows difficulties to enter our lives is to draw us closer to him (Romans 5:3-5; Hebrews 12: 7-11; 1 Peter 1:6-7).\nGod\u2019s desire is that all people know him in faith and enjoy his salvation (Isaiah 45:22).\u00a0 God\u2019s will is that those who have been brought to saving faith in Jesus Christ \u201cexamine\u201d and \u201ctest\u201d themselves (2 Corinthians 13:5).\u00a0 Your questions helped us do just that."}

I go mainly because it's one of the few places where I can receive the Means of Grace. I love Bible studies with friends and strangers, personal Bible study, and I even love it every time we use God's word to study in my school classes. However, the format and social standards in church turn me off. I hate sitting still, and that's one of the biggest social standards in church. I have gotten weird looks for bouncing my leg too much in church before... -_- I think I would benefit more if I could bring my own Bible and take notes or do something that makes me critically think, but I feel like I would get judged for that since I already get judged for bouncing my leg too much... Is it sinful for me to not find enjoyment out of regular church services?\n\n\nLet me begin with this reminder about the challenges you and I face in worshiping our Lord in his house.\nOur sinful nature presents one challenge.\u00a0 \u201cI rejoiced with those who said to me, \u2018Let us go to the house of the Lord\u2019\u201d (Psalm 122:1).\u00a0 That is the new self in the Christian speaking.\u00a0 The old self says, \u201cI hate the house of the Lord.\u00a0 I want nothing to do with it.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to be there.\u201d\nSatan presents another challenge.\u00a0 \u201cA farmer went out to sow his seed.\u00a0 As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up\u2026When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart.\u00a0 This is the seed sown along the path\u201d (Matthew 13:3-4, 19).\u00a0 Satan will do what he can to try to uproot God\u2019s word in our hearts and lives.\u00a0 He uses many tactics and approaches to carry out his goal, including the idea that a worship service is just the \u201csame old, same old.\u201d\nOther people present still another challenge.\u00a0 \u201cBad company corrupts good character\u201d (1 Corinthians 15:33).\u00a0 Other people may discourage, rather than encourage, us in our faith and in our desire to worship the Lord in his house.\nYou can see that we need God\u2019s strength to overcome these obstacles and barriers to worship the Lord in his house with joy.\nSo can I like or dislike something about worship services?\u00a0 Sure, and when I say that I recognize that I am speaking about personal preference and taste.\u00a0 I may not like how something is done in a worship service or I may not particularly like the melody of a hymn, but I recognize those \u201clikes\u201d are just my opinions.\u00a0 I realize that the worshiper sitting next to me may very well like what I dislike and vice-versa.\u00a0 I myself realize, from the perspective of a worship planner and worship leader, that I cannot possibly please everyone when it comes to conducting a worship service.\u00a0 So, perhaps, thinking of fellow worshipers might put your \u201clikes\u201d and \u201cdislikes\u201d into perspective.\nSo what can you do in connection with your questions and concerns?\u00a0 Let me pass along some suggestions (not knowing whether or not you are already doing some of these things).\nPray before worship.\u00a0 There are prayers in the hymnal for \u201cBefore Worship\u201d (Christian Worship, page 10).\u00a0 You can offer your own prayers\u2014asking that God bless your worship in keeping you free from distractions and enabling you to stay focused on the worship service particulars.\nUse the hymnal (or service folder) to follow the order of service.\u00a0 Like many worshipers I can keep my hymnal closed and keep up with the liturgical responses, but I find greater meaning when I see what I am speaking.\nBring your Bible?\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 I see fellow worshipers here and there with Bibles on-hand, and some even taking notes.\u00a0 I can tell you from the vantage point of the pulpit that it is encouraging to see that.\u00a0 I wouldn\u2019t worry about reactions from others in bringing a Bible or taking notes.\u00a0 Do what it takes to stay focused in the worship service.\u00a0 Maybe your actions in these areas will give a fellow worshiper the idea to do the same.\nWorship services are special times:\u00a0 God comes to us through word and sacrament; we give God our praise.\u00a0 In this life we recognize that our praise of God will always be imperfect.\u00a0 If we recognize we have sinful attitudes toward worshiping God, we confess those sins and receive God\u2019s forgiveness in faith.\u00a0 And then we try to worship God with better efforts.\nFinally, address your concerns and questions to your pastor.\u00a0 He is in a position to explain the services that you attend.\nAll this effort is worth it because we do want to follow our new self especially in this area of life.\u00a0 We do want this refrain to be a way of life:\u00a0 \u201cI rejoiced with those who said to me, \u2018Let us go to the house of the Lord\u2019\u201d (Psalm 122:1).\u00a0\u00a0 God bless your efforts."}
{"prompt": "Sacraments and life's cirumstances", "completion": "I am new to the Lutheran Faith. I was at one time Baptist but after spending time in the Lutheran Church and going through BIC I have come to believe that many of the doctrines I was taught (implied teaching I might add) were off. The sacraments were sacred in my church but they were more something I was doing for God not what God was doing for me. Shortly after becoming a member and being in fellowship with the WELS I was moved to a remote area of Alaska. I do not have a church nearby to participate in worship I accomplish this via internet services, devotions on WELS church sites, and this site. One of my concerns is that I do not receive Communion that often. My question is: 1. Does this put me in jeopardy of falling away from God permanently if I were to pass? 2. How do I or can I overcompensate for the loss of God's blessings I get through Communion just in my daily life? I sometimes feel like I do more reading and devotions to try and accomplish this but feel sometimes like I am spinning my wheels. Additionally, I have been tempted a few times to go to other church services or attend Bible studies that embrace my Christian faith but have not done so. I fear that being out of fellowship with those faiths puts me at more risk to fall away from God's true teachings, thus allowing Satan to confuse me or put doubt in me.

You say you live in a remote area of Alaska.\u00a0 I wonder if it is possible for your pastor to alert other WELS pastors of your situation, so that they might serve you with the sacrament if their travels take them anywhere near your location.\nRegarding worshiping at churches beyond our fellowship, you do well to continue to recognize biblical fellowship principles, understand the dangers of false teachings, and supplement your devotional life with the online resources you mentioned.\nProbably more than others who might be reading this question and answer, you\u2014because of your circumstances\u2014can appreciate the Lord\u2019s promise of his continual presence in your life (Matthew 28:20; Hebrews 13:5b).\u00a0 How wonderful it is for God to come to us through word and sacrament, and for us to be able to approach him through prayer.\u00a0 God bless you as you use his gospel to stay connected to him in faith!"}

Thank you for your help.\n\n\nYou are correct in noting that, in order for our salvation to be \u201csure and complete,\u201d Jesus had to be more than a man when he offered his life on the cross.\u00a0 Scripture says \u201cNo man can redeem the life of another or give to God a ransom for him\u2014the ransom for a life is costly, no payment is ever enough\u201d (Psalm 49:7-8).\nJesus is the God-Man.\u00a0 The angel Gabriel informed Mary that the child she would give birth to would be called \u201cThe Son of the Most High\u201d (Luke 1:32)\u00a0 and \u201cthe Son of God\u201d (Luke 1:35).\u00a0 God and man in one person is a \u201cmystery\u201d (1 Timothy 3:16) to us, but we cling to that mystery in Spirit-worked faith.\nYou also understand correctly that there is a union of the two natures in Christ, and so it is accurate to speak of God dying on the cross.\u00a0 In fact, church history is replete with individuals who denied that and whose errors led the Christian church to formulate responses from Scripture.\nIn Acts 20:28 the apostle Paul instructed the elders of the church in Ephesus to \u201cBe shepherds of the church of God, which he bought with his own blood.\u201d\u00a0 It was not the shed blood of a mere man that ransomed people, it was God\u2019s \u201cown blood.\u201d\u00a0 Similarly, in 1 John 1:7 the inspired writer comforts us with the message that \u201cthe blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin.\u201d\u00a0 Again, it is not the blood of a mere man that cleanses us from all sin, but the blood of God\u2019s Son.\nJust an aside\u2014it is Scripture alone that is the foundation of our faith, but it is interesting to see how our hymns reflect the truths of our faith.\u00a0 In that regard, take a look at some of the hymns in the Lent and Good Friday section of Christian Worship.\u00a0 Several hymns illustrate the truth of Scripture that God died in our behalf, to win our salvation.\u00a0 The refrain of one such hymn points us to a God-pleasing response:\u00a0 \u201cThousand, thousand thanks shall be, Dearest Jesus, unto thee.\u201d\u00a0 (Christian Worship 114)"}

She made a statement that she had recently learned that Lutherans do not pray for the dead and that she can't believe that we do not. How do we Lutherans know that they went to heaven. She needs all the prayers she can get both now and forever. She needs to be cleansed. She could not wrap her finger around our choice not to. Please explain so I have clarity. Thanks!\n\n\nWe do not pray for those who have died because in the case of Christians those prayers are unnecessary, and in regard to unbelievers those prayers are futile.\nWhen death occurs, judgment also takes place (Luke 16:19-31; Hebrews 9:27).\u00a0 When people die, their souls are immediately in heaven or hell.\u00a0 There is no intermediate state.\u00a0 There is no need to pray for anyone who is in heaven; theirs is a perfect existence in the presence of God.\u00a0 It would do no good to pray for someone whom we believe to be in hell; God\u2019s judgment is final and our prayers would not affect their condition.\nOf course, if people misunderstand what the Bible says about salvation, they will likely misuse prayer in praying for those who have died.\u00a0 If people think that they\u2014in any way\u2014contribute to their salvation, there will be doubt.\u00a0 Questions and requests like these might then arise:\u00a0 \u201cHave I done enough?\u201d \u201cCan I do enough?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cDo something for me after I die, like praying for me.\u201d\nHow sad that is.\u00a0 Scripture presents salvation as an accomplished fact and truth.\u00a0 Jesus lived up to his name which means \u201cSavior.\u201d\u00a0 He won our salvation.\u00a0 He announced that on the cross when he cried out, \u201cIt is finished\u201d (John 19:30).\u00a0 Salvation is God\u2019s doing (Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:4-7).\u00a0 Because Jesus did everything necessary for our salvation, Christians can be absolutely sure that when death comes, they will be in heaven.\u00a0 We have the Lord\u2019s own word on that (Mark 16:16; John 3:16; 5:24)."}

It is a partnership in which the man is the loving head. Marriage is established by God. It is a holy relationship not to be broken. A married person sins if he or she divorces without a biblical reason. Before God, no divorce is valid except in cases of fornication or desertion.

What Scriptures support this? Thank you for your time.

Thank you for your information, and God's blessings.\n\n\nThese factors are generally put forth as explanations for the growth of Islam in the United States:\u00a0 a higher birth rate among Muslims and the immigration of Muslims to America.\u00a0 Growth also takes place through intermarriage with Muslims.\nEarly in its history Islam appealed to people because of its simplistic faith.\u00a0 While Christians were debating matters of intricate doctrine, Islam promoted a \u201csimple\u201d faith consisting of only five \u201cpillars,\u201d or five duties, that adherents needed to perform.\u00a0 That impression of a simplistic faith, I suppose, still appeals to some people.\u00a0 In addition, because Islam is a work-righteous religion, it naturally appeals to people who think there is something they have to do and can do to find peace with a higher power.\nWhen it comes to your question of why God \u201cdoesn\u2019t stop them,\u201d I have to bow in humility to God\u2019s wisdom (Romans 11:33-36).\u00a0 God knows what he is doing, and he is doing everything in the best interests of his Church.\u00a0 I have to keep that same section of Scripture in mind when God tells me that shortly before the end of the world, he will grant Satan more freedom to carry out his dastardly work (Revelation 20:7-8).\u00a0 I marvel at the question Jesus posed about his visible return on the last day:\u00a0 \u201cWhen the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?\u201d\u00a0 (Luke 18:8)\nOver time, God\u2019s followers have been a \u201clittle flock\u201d (Luke 12:32) compared to the numbers of people caught up in false religions.\u00a0 Because of what the Bible says about \u201cterrible times in the last days\u201d (2 Timothy 3:1), we can expect that description of the Church to hold true.\nAll this is not reason for discouragement.\u00a0 No, the Good Shepherd of the little flock promises us his protecting love and informs us of his generous love that seeks to add sheep to his flock (John 10)."}
{"prompt": "Repentance and baptist", "completion": "How does one justify infant baptism with the call to repent in Acts 2:38? Doesn't it imply that repentance (and, thus belief) is required before baptism? Please explain.

Yet many of our area Lutheran high schools are connected with thrift stores whose mission is to support those high schools. Is this okay? How can this practice be justified in light of the warning against seeking funding from those outside of our fellowship?\n\n\nYou are correct in noting that congregations are rightly concerned about the impression fundraising in the community can give to people in the community who are not part of the congregation.\u00a0 Congregational fundraising in the community can reinforce what many wrongly think in the first place\u2014that \u201call the church is concerned about is money.\u201d\u00a0 Congregational fundraising in the community can reinforce work-righteous thinking in some of the unchurched, leading them to think that \u201cI\u2019ve given to God, so I\u2019ve done my duty.\u201d\u00a0 Congregational fundraising in the community can undermine a church\u2019s efforts to encourage its members to grow in their management of God\u2019s blessings if they grow instead in their reliance on community revenue.\nThere is reason for our area Lutheran high schools to have these same concerns about fundraising in the community.\u00a0 And so, federations and associations of congregations do well to approach this matter of Christian freedom\u2014and that is what fundraising in general is\u2014with prayerful deliberation and application of scriptural principles in the best interests of its constituents and members of the community.\nFederations and associations of congregations that have come to the conclusion that a thrift store fits well in their circumstances are exercising their Christian freedom.\u00a0 As with any area of Christian freedom, people are bound to have differing thoughts and opinions.\u00a0 That calls for patient discussion and listening on the part of those who are connected to an association/federation that operates a thrift store and non-judgmental Christian love on the part of those who are viewing such a venture from a distance.\nWhen it comes to that which you asked about, as in any area of life where there is Christian freedom, we seek to do all things to the glory of God (1 Corinthians 10:31).\u00a0 We look to show love to our neighbor (Romans 13:9-10).\u00a0 We want to be guided by faith and not doubt (Romans 14:23)."}

{"prompt": "Weak and doubting faith", "completion": "Hi! I am a high school student and lately I have been struggling with my faith. I do go to a WELS high school and went to a WELS grade school as well. However, I have been questioning my beliefs and whether or not Christianity is the true religion. I get scared whenever these thoughts form in my head, because I know that if I don't believe in Jesus as my Savior I will not receive eternal salvation. I wonder if God really exists sometimes. I am just struggling with my faith and would like some advice to get my firm faith in God back. \n\n\nThrough your elementary and high school education in WELS schools, you have received and are receiving a wonderful instruction in God\u2019s word.\u00a0 Through classes and worship services the Holy Spirit has had numerous opportunities to work through the gospel to strengthen your faith.\u00a0 The result is that you do recognize that there is salvation only through Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).\nStill, questions about the faith can arise.\u00a0 In one regard, questions about the faith are good and appropriate.\u00a0 Scripture provides this instruction:\u00a0 \u201cExamine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves\u201d (2 Corinthians 13:5).\u00a0 What we don\u2019t want to do is take our faith for granted or take an approach that sees faith as hereditary:\u00a0 \u201cMy parents are Christians.\u00a0 I\u2019m a Christian.\u00a0 They believe certain things, and I just believe what they believe.\u201d\u00a0 We are to be Berean Christians (Acts 17:11), examining the Scriptures and seeing for ourselves what our faith is all about.\nSo, questioning faith in that context is good and appropriate.\u00a0 Questioning faith, as in doubting, is not good.\u00a0 You and I will want to recognize that the source of doubt is the ungodly trio of the devil, the sinful world and our sinful flesh.\u00a0 Those spiritual enemies want us to doubt the Christian faith and abandon the Christian faith.\nWhat do we do?\u00a0 We turn to Jesus who came into the world to fulfill all the prophecies of the Messiah.\u00a0 One of those prophecies was:\u00a0 \u201cA bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out\u201d (Matthew 12:20).\u00a0\u00a0 The Messiah was to be a person who would be compassionate toward the weak and the doubting, and bolster their faith.\u00a0 You can be confident that is Jesus\u2019 attitude toward you.\u00a0 He wants you to be sure and confident about the Christian faith.\nTo achieve that end, God holds out his gospel in word and sacrament for you to use.\u00a0 So, especially now, dive into God\u2019s word and be a frequent guest at the Lord\u2019s Supper.\u00a0 Do recognize that doubts will decrease and faith will increase as God works in your heart through the gospel (Romans 10:17).\nFinally, there is a practical matter to consider.\u00a0 I wonder if you are able to identify the times and sources when your doubts about Christianity arise.\u00a0 Is there a pattern?\u00a0 Are there triggers for doubt and uncertainty?\u00a0 Answering those questions might help you form a strategy in your journey through life as a Christian.\nI\u2019m glad you asked this question and I hope you received helpful information.\u00a0 Do speak with your pastor or high school adviser.\u00a0 They will not consider your situation unusual by any means.\u00a0 Rather, they will understand the struggles Christians of all ages experience, and do what they can to help.\u00a0 God bless you."}

However, I am troubled by something I read in the \"licenses and rights granted to us\" section under \"Rights and Use Information\" on one such site, familysearch.org, Basically, in exchange for an account, one allows the site owners unrestricted access to all of the genealogy information one has collected and placed on their site, including family trees, sources, etc. I understand that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is interested in family trees and those that have passed away, but for what or to what extent I do not know. So my question is this: is creating an account on LDS owned or affiliated websites okay, or is making an account in some way enabling or approving of the LDS church and their beliefs?\n\n\nMormons are interested in genealogies and Web sites that contain genealogical data because that supplies them with information to be used for their baptisms of the dead.\n\u201cThe teachings of Mormonism state that non-Mormons will enter spirit prison after physical death and wait for Judgment Day. Those in spirit prison have the opportunity to convert to Mormonism, but they cannot eternally progress unless they are baptized. Such spirits must receive baptism vicariously through a living person on earth since they do not have a body that can be baptized. The work of baptizing for the dead (or redeeming the dead) happens only in the temple. Faithful Mormons will carry out this important temple work as a means to further their divine potential. This is the primary motivation behind the extensive genealogical research carried out by the LDS Church. Mormons will refer to this activity as doing family history work.\u201d (From Truth in Love Ministry)\nUsing an LDS-owned or affiliated Web site will provide information that can be used in a religious ceremony\u2014a ceremony that is entirely void of truth and consequence.\u00a0 If supplying that information bothers you, I would not submit it.\u00a0 If you do not want the Mormons to have more names for their baptism of the dead, I would not utilize the Web sites.\u00a0 If your approach is:\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m interested in my family history and it doesn\u2019t bother me what a church does with the names of family members because the souls of those family members are beyond the reach of that church,\u201d then go ahead and make use of those Web sites.\u00a0 (You see that conscience is a factor here.)\nIf you are interested in learning more about Mormonism, visit the Truth in Love Ministry Web site."}

How much does it cost to start a world mission? The costs can fluctuate quite a bit depending on where in the world the mission effort is focused as well as the manpower needs of the new start.\u00a0 If we need to send a missionary to reside onsite, just that will cost about $100,000/yr.\u00a0 If a local leader is being supported with teaching and advice from afar the cost can be quite a bit less.\u00a0 We often find a budget of $20,000-$30,000 is a good ball park for the cost to begin translation and distribution of Christian materials.\n\u201c2. What staff is needed for that mission?\u00a0 This also varies depending on the reason we are starting.\u00a0 If this is a contact that is already in place and gathering a group we would try to send in minimal foreign help.\u00a0 If no such leader is in place we try to send in a team of at least two missionaries so that the early start-up work can be shared and the transition to a new life and culture can have this mutual support.\u00a0 It seems that more and more of our starts are based on requests from local leaders and require minimal foreign missionary presence.\u00a0 In those instances our efforts focus on staff needed for material production and leadership training.\n\u201c3.

{"prompt": "gambling and giving", "completion": "What is the church's stance on casino gambling? I don't do it very often, but I recently won $450 on a slot machine.

I doubt that will ever happen, but would the church even accept money that came from a lottery? Or would I have to give it to them without saying where it came from? Thank you for your time.\n\n\nThe Bible does not specifically address gambling, but does speak of greed and covetousness that can easily and often be associated with gambling.\u00a0 In addition, the Bible instructs us not to squander the resources that God has entrusted to us, but rather use them to provide for our families (1 Timothy 5:8), to pay taxes (Romans 13:6-7), to give back to the Lord and his church (1 Corinthians 16:2) and to help those who have needs (1 John 3:17).\nAs might be expected, Scripture does not address the matter of a church receiving gifts that originated from lottery or gambling proceeds that are not tainted by sinful motives or actions.\u00a0 Usually congregations do not know the source of members\u2019 offerings.\u00a0 If you were to win a large sum of money and considered giving part of it to your church, I could foresee conscience playing a role in whether or not you revealed the source of that gift.\u00a0 And while consciences of congregational leaders might play a role in receiving that gift, the church could receive your gift with the knowledge that the giving was done in faith and motivated by love and gratitude for God\u2019s grace in Christ."}

{"prompt": "Understanding the last day", "completion": "I know that we as Lutherans reject the teaching of the rapture. There are many passages in the Bible that indicate that Christians will go through a tribulation period in the last days and these passages also confirm that the teaching of the rapture is false. Below I referenced some passages that seem to slightly contradict or maybe just alter the timeline of events that the Lutheran church teaches:  Matthew 24:40-41 and 1 Corinthians 15:51-52.    \r\n\r\nAlso, I have read 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 multiple times and from that it is difficult for me to understand that the day the Lord will gather believers to take us home and judgement day are not two different things. That section of Scripture seems like it is only talking about the Lord taking us home and does not mention judgement day. \r\n\r\nAlso, when I read Titus 2:13 and Amos 5:18, it seems like these passages are indicating that there are two separate events. The first event is one we eagerly anticipate and the second event is supposed to be feared. \r\n\r\nTo briefly sum up my understanding of all this I can put it like this: we Christians will go through the tribulation period (Matthew 24 makes this clear), then the Lord will gather his believers and take us home, and finally the unbelievers will be judged. If you could tell me if I'm on or off course with this line of thinking, that would be great.\r\n\n\n\nAllow me to comment briefly on several points you made and Scripture passages you cited.\u00a0 The \u201ctribulation period\u201d Christians go through in life is the Christian life in general, not any particular time in their life or in world history (Acts 14:22).\nMatthew 24:40-41 shows how believers and unbelievers will be separated on the last day.\u00a0 1 Corinthians 15:51-52 explains that there will be Christians on earth when Jesus returns visibly on the last day.\u00a0 Those Christians will not experience death, but their bodies\u2014like the resurrected bodies of Christians\u2014will also be glorified.\n1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 describes the Lord returning visibly to this world on the last day, raising the bodies of Christians and reuniting them with their souls, and gathering to himself Christians who are alive on the earth.\u00a0 The apostle Paul was addressing a concern on the part of the Thessalonian Christians regarding fellow Christians who had died.\u00a0 That is why he limits his treatment of judgment day in this section of the Bible to Christians who died and Christians who are still alive on the earth.\nTitus 2:13 and Amos 5:18 do not describe two separate events; they describe how different the last day will be for believers and unbelievers.\u00a0 For believers, the last day will usher in an eternity of joy and glory that they will experience with their glorified bodies and souls (Revelation 21:3-4).\u00a0 For unbelievers, the last day will be a banishment, with both body and soul, to the darkness of hell (Matthew 22:13; 25:41).\u00a0 With this in mind, it is very understandable that there will be different reactions to the Lord\u2019s return.\nTo reflect biblical teaching, your summary statement would need to be revised.\u00a0 Christians do go through much hardship and tribulation to enter the kingdom of God.\u00a0 On the last day Jesus will return to judge \u201cthe living and the dead,\u201d as we confess in the Apostles\u2019 Creed.\u00a0 The Lord will gather his followers to himself, while he will banish the unbelievers from his presence.\nHow wonderful to be able to take to heart what our Lord himself said about his return on the last day:\u00a0 \u201cWhen these things begin to take place, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near\u201d (Luke 21:28).\u00a0 Let\u2019s share God\u2019s word with others that they too may be prepared for and look forward to Jesus\u2019 return."}

However, some people think that repentance is a work that has to be done to earn salvation, especially since being unrepentant can take away your salvation.  How do I explain to someone that repentance is not a work?\n\n\nYou can explain that repentance is a work\u2014not done by people to save themselves, but produced in them by the Holy Spirit.\u00a0 The Bible speaks of repentance in a narrower and wider sense.\u00a0 In the narrower sense it is contrition and sorrow over sin (Mark 1:15).\u00a0 In the wider sense repentance refers to both contrition and faith (Luke 13:5; 15:7).\u00a0 It is the Holy Spirit who works in people to confess their sins and to confess faith in Christ as their Savior.\u00a0 Repentance, in either sense, is not anything that people manufacture on their own.\u00a0 Confessing sins is an example of the power of \u201cGod who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose\u201d (Philippians 2:13)."}
{"prompt": "Pastors' responsibility for Communion", "completion": "Why in close communion does the pastor seem totally responsible for the communicant?  The gospels do not mention about possible punishment  and 1 Corinthians 11:17-32 tells us that the communicant needs to bear the responsibility.  My Concordia Self Study Bible (NIV) tells me in the explanation of v. 29 dealing with judgment:  judgment, not God's eternal judgment which is to come to the unbeliever, but such disciplinary judgment as physical sickness and death (V.30).  So my question then is why is close communion understood by most pastors as \"eternal punishment?\"\n\n\nAllow me to clarify a couple of assumptions.\u00a0 I do not believe our pastors view the practice of closed communion as an expression of their understanding that they are totally responsible for communicants\u2019 actions or attitudes.\u00a0 That was never my approach as a parish pastor.\u00a0 Communicants are instructed to examine themselves before receiving the sacrament (1 Corinthians 11:28).\nPastors do take seriously the instruction to \u201cKeep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers.\u00a0 Be shepherds of the church of God, which he bought with his own blood\u201d (Acts 20:28).\u00a0 Pastors do take seriously the instruction to carry out their responsibilities faithfully (1 Corinthians 4:2).\u00a0 Part of a pastor\u2019s concern is doing what he can so that no one \u201ceats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner\u201d (1 Corinthians 11:27), or that a false picture of unity is presented when the Lord\u2019s Supper is celebrated (1 Corinthians 10:17).\u00a0 The practice of closed communion addresses those concerns.\nWith your last statement I take it that you are referencing the situation of a person receiving the sacrament in an unworthy manner and bringing \u201cjudgment on himself\u201d (1 Corinthians 11:29).\u00a0 In the verses that follow, the apostle lists examples of some temporal, and not eternal, judgments people brought on themselves.\nIn summary, closed communion is the historic and biblical practice of the Christian Church.\u00a0 The practice has the purposes of ensuring that, as far as humanly possible, those receiving the sacrament do so to their benefit and not their harm (1 Corinthians 11:27-30), and that the oneness that is expressed in receiving the sacrament is genuine and not contrived (1 Corinthians 10:17)."}
{"prompt": "Music videos in worship service", "completion": "After studying WELS\u2019 worship and fellowship practices, my understanding is that non-WELS members are not allowed to lead the singing, play, or preach in our worship services, marriage ceremonies, etc.  Yet our church uses music videos by groups such as Casting Crowns as the \u201chymns\u201d in our contemporary service.  If it is OK for Baptist youth ministers like the Casting Crowns to play and lead the songs in a worship service via video, would it also be OK for a Baptist minister to preach the sermon via video?  Neither seems right to me.  Using these videos seems inconsistent with our fellowship practices because we are advocating and promoting Christian pop musicians in our worship service when we do not share their beliefs.  Shouldn\u2019t we be using the talents and active participation of our own WELS musicians instead of giving the appearance of being in fellowship with heterodox denominations?\n\n\nYour understanding of our fellowship practices is accurate. The scenario you described does provide opportunity for confusion and offense.

Can a believer who says these words lose his faith and condemn himself even if he did not believe that what he was saying was true?\n\n\nJust as Christians speak of their faith (confess their faith) on the basis of what is in their hearts, so unbelievers speak on the basis of what is in their hearts.\u00a0 The sentence you quoted describes people speaking blasphemously about Jesus because of their identification of Christ with Satan.\u00a0 Such people are not speaking empty words; they are professing what their minds have concluded and their hearts have embraced.\u00a0 Jesus was not speaking of a Christian\u2019s reckless conversation.\u00a0 In the context, he was warning against willful and malicious rejection of the gospel against better knowledge.\nAs Christians, we recognize that there is always room for our faith to grow.\u00a0 That is why we can identify so easily with the man who said to Jesus, \u201cI do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!\u201d\u00a0 (Mark 9:24)"}

The hymns were out of our hymnal with no chance of being improper.  Why do we refrain from praying and singing with other religions?  \n\n\nA paragraph from This We Believe answers your question succinctly:\u00a0 \u201c6. We believe that those whose confession of faith reveals that they are united in the doctrines of Scripture will express their fellowship in Christ as occasion permits (Ephesians 4:3). They may express their fellowship by joint worship, by joint proclamation of the gospel, by joining in Holy Communion, by joint prayer, and by joint church work. God directs believers not to practice religious fellowship with those whose confession and actions reveal that they teach, tolerate, support, or defend error (2 John 10,11). When error appears in the church, Christians will try to preserve their fellowship by patiently admonishing the offenders, in the hope that they will turn from their error (2 Timothy 2:25,26; Titus 3:10). But the Lord commands believers not to practice church fellowship with people who persist in teaching or adhering to beliefs that are false (Romans 16:17,18).\u201d"}

Didn't the men and women in biblical times dress similarly? This question is in regard to cross dressing only without being involved in homosexual activities.\n\n\nIn Deuteronomy 22:5 God had instructed Old Testament Israel:\u00a0 \u201cA woman must not wear men\u2019s clothing, nor a man wear women\u2019s clothing, for the LORD your God detests anyone who does this.\u201d\u00a0 The People\u2019s Bible Commentary on Deuteronomy provides a good explanation of that command and a response to your question.\n\u201cWhile this law might sound like a blanket prohibition against wearing any clothing ordinarily worn by the opposite sex, some commentators have seen a deeper meaning here.\u00a0 There was a connection between cross-dressing and some features of Canaanite fertility religion.\u00a0 Worship directed to Astarte, the twin sister of Baal, sometimes featured men masquerading in women\u2019s clothing and women appearing in men\u2019s clothing.\u00a0 Homosexuality was also associated with Baal worship.\n\u201cThe New Testament contains no hard-and-fast regulations for the kind of clothing God wants his people to wear, but it does include general principles for people of all times.\u00a0 Peter told women, \u2018Your beauty should not come from outward adornment.\u2019\u00a0 Such outward adornment will take various forms and styles in different cultures.\u00a0 \u2018Instead, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God\u2019s sight\u2019 (1 Peter 3:4).\u00a0 Paul urged women to \u2018dress modestly, with decency and propriety\u2019 (1 Timothy 2:9).\u00a0 Paul told the Corinthians that \u2018every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head.\u00a0 And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head\u2019 (1 Corinthians 11:4, 5).\u00a0 The details of the Corinthian custom aren\u2019t entirely clear to us, but God wants the customs among any group of people faithfully to reflect the roles he\u2019s designed for men and women.\n\u201cStyles change from one time and place to another; it\u2019s impossible to dictate a specific dress code for all the rest of human history.\u00a0 God wants men and women to appreciate the dignity of their own sex, instead of assuming the appearance or preferring the role of the opposite sex\u201d (pp. 197-198).\nTo those thoughts I would add the reminder of what Christian freedom is all about.\u00a0 In areas of Christian freedom I am mindful of what is in the best interests of others and how my actions might negatively affect them.\u00a0 While Christian freedom means that I can pursue a course of action, Christian freedom also means I have the right not to do something."}
{"prompt": "Spiritual gifts today", "completion": "I grew up in a WELS church, day school, and attended an ELS college and still hold fast to the solid scriptural foundation at the basis of the WELS. Currently, I attend a solid, non-denominational church where my wife works in the youth ministry. I do not question the core teachings of the church when it comes to faith, repentance and salvation. However, there are a few topics that don't seem to be a matter of salvation, but of understanding. The greatest of these topics that troubles me is the question of spiritual gifts for Christians: speaking in tongues, gifts of healing, gifts of prophecy, and others. In regard to the three specific \"gifts\" I've listed, what advice would you give to me (and others) to discern perceived evidence supporting these claimed gifts and how they apply today in the New Testament Era? \n\n\nIn This We Believe, a statement of belief of our church body, we maintain:\u00a0 \u201cThe Holy Spirit also equips the church with all the spiritual gifts it needs for its well-being (1 Corinthians 12:4-11). During the beginning of the New Testament era, special charismatic gifts were given to the church, such as signs, miracles, and speaking in tongues. These gifts were connected with the ministry of the apostles (2 Corinthians 12:12). There is no evidence in Scripture that we today should expect the continuation of such charismatic gifts.\u201d\nGod of course can do anything.\u00a0 If he chooses to give a person special gifts, he can do so.\u00a0 The key statement in the section above is the last sentence:\u00a0 \u201cThere is no evidence in Scripture that we today should expect the continuation of such charismatic gifts.\u201d\nBecause the claims of many people who supposedly possessed such gifts have proved to be fraudulent, it is wise to approach this subject with caution as you are suggesting.\u00a0 The ecstatic speech of charismatics today is far different from the gift of speaking in known, intelligible languages in Acts 2.\u00a0 Spiritual gifts are to be used \u201cfor the common good\u201d (1 Corinthians 12:7).\u00a0 When people cannot understand the syllables coming out of another person\u2019s mouth, there is no value to others (1 Corinthians 14).\u00a0 Also, keep in mind that \u201cprophecy\u201d in the Bible can refer to the activity of the prophets who relayed specific messages from God, or it can refer to Christians who have been gifted with the ability to speak God\u2019s word to others (Acts 2:18).\nRather than focusing on spectacular gifts that God definitely gave in the past, churches would do well to consider what God says about spiritual gifts in general (Romans 12:1-8; 1 Corinthians 12; Ephesians 4:11-13; 1 Peter 4:10-11).\nWhile you mentioned that you were troubled by your current church\u2019s understanding of spiritual gifts, I would encourage you to give some thought to your current church\u2019s understanding and teaching of baptism, the Lord\u2019s Supper and faith/conversion.\u00a0 Non-denominational churches can easily have unscriptural views toward these doctrines.\u00a0 Do understand what your church teaches about those doctrines and compare those teachings with the Bible.\u00a0 In everything, be a Berean Christian (Acts 17:10-11) and see for yourself what God\u2019s word teaches.\u00a0 Then, distance yourself from any false teachings (Romans 16:17) and enjoy fellowship with people who are united in biblical doctrine (1 John 1:3)."}

How do I explain that our practice of infant baptism has scriptural backing? \n\n\nIn the August 2015 \u201cLight for our Path\u201d column in Forward in Christ I addressed that question.\nFrom Forward in Christ: When Jesus instituted Baptism in Matthew 28:19,20, he did not limit Baptism to adults. He said \u201call nations\u201d were to be instructed in his Word and baptized. Think of all the people who comprise a nation. Think of who is counted as a citizen of a nation when a census occurs. All people are counted. If infants were to be excluded from Baptism, Jesus\u2019 words in Matthew 28 would have been an appropriate place to indicate that. Because in every sense infants are included in \u201call nations,\u201d they are to be the recipients of Baptism.\nMore than being people who are part of a nation, infants are to be baptized because they have a need for the forgiveness of sins. The Bible does not speak of any age of innocence or any time in life when infants and children are not sinners and not responsible for their sins. Just the opposite, Scripture speaks of people being conceived and born in sin. King David spoke for the entire human race when he confessed, \u201cSurely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me\u201d (Psalm 51:5). Jesus reiterated that truth when he informed Nicodemus that \u201cflesh gives birth to flesh\u201d (John 3:6). In other words, sinful parents have sinful children.\nA final reason for baptizing infants is that the Bible reveals to us that children and infants can believe. Passages like Matthew 18:6; Luke 18:15-17; and 2 Timothy 3:15 provide proof of that.\nSo rather than a single verse addressing infant Baptism, it is the case of numerous Bible passages demonstrating why little ones too are to be baptized.\nRead more of the Forward in Christ article.\nGod bless your discussions of infant baptism with your girlfriend.

Any other flag so displayed should be placed on the left of the clergyman or speaker or to the right of the audience.\" According to the U.S. flag code, I was correct in thinking that the flag of the United States was being displayed on the incorrect side of the sanctuary. However, I thought about it some more because the code states \"the position of superior prominence\" and \"the position of honor,\" as the other flag displayed in our sanctuary is the Christian Flag (according to Wikipedia it is described as having a white field, with a red Latin cross inside a blue canton). This leads to my question: which flag should be placed in the position of superior prominence and honor, the flag of the United States or the Christian Flag? I am guessing that the answer is the flag of the United States because it is the law and we are to submit to the governing authorities (Romans 13); however, I would like your thoughts on the matter. Thank you!\n\n\nTo put your question in perspective, the \u201cCongressional Research Service Report for Congress on The United States Flag:\u00a0 Federal Law Relating to Display and Associated Questions\u201d states:\u00a0 \u201cOn the national level the Federal Flag Code provides uniform guidelines for the display of and respect shown to the flag\u2026The Code is designed \u2018for the use of such civilian groups or organizations as may not be required to conform with regulations promulgated by one or more executive departments\u2019 of the federal government.\u00a0 Thus, the Flag Code does not prescribe any penalties for non-compliance nor does it include enforcement provisions; rather the Code functions simply as a guide to be voluntarily followed by civilians and civilian groups.\u201d\nAdditional \u201cperspective setting\u201d is the understanding that we are dealing with an adiaphoron here\u2014something that God has neither commanded nor forbidden.\u00a0 Christians thus have freedom to display or not display a flag in their churches.\nIf a church is going to display flags (an American and a church flag) in the chancel, they would probably cause the least confusion by following the Flag Code guidelines.\u00a0 If a church is not going to display flags, they would have reason for doing so.\u00a0 In that regard, let me pass along information from Christian Worship:\u00a0 Manual, the companion book to Christian Worship:\u00a0 A Lutheran Hymnal.\u00a0 In the chapter titled \u201cThe Worship Space,\u201d there is this food for thought:\u00a0 \u201cSome churches like to include the national, Christian, and denominational flags in the chancel.\u00a0 While many Lutheran congregations have displayed flags of one sort or another, building committees ought to carefully analyze this tradition.\u00a0 Altar, pulpit, and font \u2018all point to Christ,\u2019 while national flags \u2018speak not of Christ, but of the nation\u2019 [Brugginck and Droppers, Christ and Architecture, pp. 250ff].\u00a0 Especially in an age when so many Christian churches confuse the separate roles of church and state, it may be wise to place national flags in the narthex rather than in the chancel.\u00a0 The use of the Christian flag may promote an imprecise view of the church and false ecumenism besides.\u00a0 Denominational loyalty is important in a congregation, but recent history seems to indicate that it is better to teach loyalty to the Scriptures that cannot err than to denominations that can.\u00a0 The important work of the church body can surely be emphasized in better ways than with a flag\u201d (pp. 85-86).\nAgain, because this is a matter on which Scripture is silent, congregations do well to explain clearly their rationale for whatever their particular practice in this area might be."}
{"prompt": "Malicious Desertion", "completion": "Abuse was mentioned in my mother's church sermon as grounds for divorce. This brought up a discussion in our family of what are the biblical grounds for divorce. I read most of the Q and A under divorce and found that \"malicious\" desertion could be grounds. But I wasn't quite able to determine what exactly was meant by this. I would appreciate some clarification if possible. I thoroughly enjoy your magazine and read it cover to cover each issue. By the way, did you know that another church body has a magazine called Forward in Christ? I Googled Forward in Christ and was surprised to learn it wasn't the WELS version.\n\n\nBeyond physically deserting a spouse, the Bible does not specifically list other ways in which malicious desertion can take place (I Corinthians 7:15).\u00a0 As malicious desertion is characterized by sins that are unilateral, willful and permanent, it could take the form of physical or emotional abuse, refusal to have sexual relations with one\u2019s spouse, or refusal to support the spouse financially.\u00a0 Because of the complexities of relationships, Christian discernment and pastoral counseling are essential when it comes to determining malicious desertion.\nI\u2019m glad to hear of your enjoyment of Forward in Christ.\u00a0 Yes, there is another magazine by the same title.\u00a0 And, as you noticed, there is no connection between the two."}
{"prompt": "Altar flowers", "completion": "Is it proper to leave flowers on the altar for more than one time?

{"prompt": "Death and judgement day", "completion": "It is my understanding from the Bible that when a person dies, his soul is separated from his body. Our bodies at this time remain on earth while a believer's soul goes to Heaven and a non-believer's soul goes to Hell. So those in death have already faced their judgement. On the day of Judgement when our Savior returns, it is my understanding that a person's body and soul are reunited and believers go to Heaven with non-believers going to Hell. Is this all correct? Also, after a person dies and before Judgement what is the status of, I guess, our souls both as believers and unbelievers? Are we kind of in \"limbo\"? As believers do we enjoy all the benefits in heaven with our soul (not body) or do we have to wait until Judgment Day? Same for non-believers, are they in \"limbo\" or are they feeling the pains of Hell before Judgment Day? Thank you.\n\n\nYour understanding of events in the first paragraph is correct:\u00a0 when death takes place, judgment also takes place (Hebrews 9:27).\nSince that is the case, Christians after death and before the Last Day enjoy the benefits of heaven with their souls, and unbelievers after death and before the Last Day experience the torments of hell according to their souls.\u00a0 There is no limbo of any kind.\u00a0 The account of the rich man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31) illustrates how Christians enjoy being in the presence of God and unbelievers experience suffering after death and before Judgment Day.\nOn the Last Day the Lord will raise the bodies of all who have died (John 5:28-29).\u00a0 Bodies and souls will be reunited and Christians will continue to enjoy perfect life in God\u2019s presence according to both body and soul, while unbelievers will continue to experience suffering according to both body and soul.\u00a0 Those who are alive on the Last Day will not experience death but will be judged according to what is in their hearts.\nNot to be overlooked is the transformation of Christians\u2019 bodies\u2014whether they died or will be alive on the Last Day (1 Corinthians 15:35-57).\u00a0 Certainly our Easter celebration is reason to praise God for our victory over death and to share that victorious message with others."}

Wouldn't this help Christian missionaries today make the point that Bible truth is for all people everywhere? \n\n\nThere is no need for speculation here.\u00a0 Christian missionaries can tell their audiences that the truth of the Bible is for them because that is the Bible\u2019s very message.\u00a0 I think of the Lord\u2019s promise to Abram:\u00a0 \u201c\u2026all peoples on earth will be blessed through you\u201d (Genesis 12:3).\u00a0 I think of Jesus\u2019 words to Nicodemus:\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFor God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life\u201d (John 3:16).\u00a0 I think of Peter\u2019s proclamation of the prophet Joel\u2019s message:\u00a0 \u201cAnd everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved\u201d (Acts 2:21).\u00a0 In the Bible God makes it very clear that his love knows no bounds and that his kingdom consists of believers \u201cfrom every nation, tribe, people and language\u201d (Revelation 7:9).\nAbundantly clear passages like these eliminate the need for speculation on how the Bible\u2019s message might be applicable to people everywhere.\u00a0 The Bible\u2019s message is for everyone.\u00a0 Christian missionaries\u2014of every kind\u2014seek to share that beautiful truth with everyone."}
{"prompt": "Absolution during Lent", "completion": "I've been a lifelong Lutheran. My faith predates the formation of the ELCA. I am frankly becoming very confused with the ELCA's practices. One such practice is the denial of absolution during Lent. During Lent, as stated, absolution is withheld until Maundy Thursday. Yet, Communion is served. If I am not mistaken, in accordance to the teachings of Luther and the Scriptures, no man has the authority to withhold God's forgiveness being it Pastor, Bishop, Pope, etc. Am I mistaken? Also, doesn't one have to ask forgiveness of their sins and be \"sort of\" right with God before taking Communion? I'm becoming disillusioned. \n\n\nI have heard of people giving up many things for Lent but never the absolution.\u00a0 This is a practice with which I was not familiar\u2014as were several of my colleagues in the ministry whom I consulted.\u00a0 I did find the practice online in a worship resource, but I\u2019m with you in that this practice is puzzling.\u00a0 The stated purpose of that practice is \u201cto underscore the entire season of Lent as a time of repentance\u201d and to underscore \u201cthe brokenness of our relationship with God.\u201d\nI can understand why you felt empty when, after speaking the confession of sins, there was no spoken absolution.\u00a0 It would be comparable to King David saying in Psalm 32:5 \u2013 \u201cThen I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my iniquity.\u00a0 I said, \u2018I will confess my transgressions to the Lord,\u201d and then omitting the end of that verse: \u201cand you forgave the guilt of my sin.\u201d\u00a0 Luther\u2019s Catechism explains on the basis of God\u2019s Word that \u201cConfession has two parts.\u00a0 The one is that we confess our sins; the other, that we receive absolution or forgiveness from the pastor as from God himself, not doubting but firmly believing that our sins are thus forgiven before God in heaven.\u201d\nAcknowledging that Lent is a time of repentance and a season that underscores \u201cthe brokenness of our relationship with God\u201d is accurate, but there is more to Lent\u2019s message than that.\u00a0 The season of Lent holds up the gospel message in great detail, showing that God \u201cdid not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all\u201d (Romans 8:32).\u00a0 Lent demonstrates how \u201cChrist redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us\u201d (Galatians 3:13).\nYes, Scripture does speak of unworthily reception of the sacrament and the need for self-examination (1 Corinthians 11:27-28).\u00a0 At least speaking the confession in the worship service aided you in self-examination, and that confession was followed up with the message of forgiveness in the sacrament.\nI hope you are addressing your concerns to your pastor.\u00a0 That is the person who really needs to hear them.\u00a0 God guide you in those conversations."}

{"prompt": "Alien contact demonic?", "completion": "One is often exposed to stories and reports of encounters with aliens from outer space. I believe that most of these cases can be explained as hoaxes, mistaken interpretations of an experience, or someone wanting attention. Despite that, there are some instances in which an \"encounter\" cannot be completely explained away. Is it possible that demons could be at work in trying to deceive people by taking on the appearance of an alien, or the image that most people believe an alien would look like?

Thank you.\n\n\nI don\u2019t believe you are wrong in suggesting that possibility\u2014and that\u2019s all it is, a possibility.\u00a0 The Bible reminds us that \u201cOur struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms\u201d (Ephesians 6:12).\u00a0 Satan is an enemy whose power exceeds our own.\u00a0 His goal is to destroy faith in people who believe and keep others in unbelief (2 Corinthians 4:4).\u00a0 There is no telling what Satan might attempt to do to carry out his goals.\nThankfully we are dealing with a defeated enemy, one whose head has been crushed (Genesis 3:15).\u00a0 Jesus Christ shared in our humanity \u201cso that by his death he might destroy him who holds the power of death\u2014that is, the devil\u201d (Hebrews 2:14).\u00a0 By his holy life, death and resurrection Jesus has destroyed Satan, and it is only a matter of time before he is put out of commission entirely (Revelation 20:10).\u00a0 Until that time, Christians like you and I carry out God\u2019s instruction:\u00a0 \u201cPut on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil\u2019s schemes\u201d (Ephesians 6:11).\u00a0 We do that trusting in God\u2019s promise:\u00a0 \u201cResist the devil, and he will flee from you\u201d (James 4:7)."}

{"prompt": "New Testament Commands", "completion": "What does the Bible mean when it says to keep Jesus' commandments?\n\n\nJesus did not come into the world as a second Moses; he came into the world as God\u2019s personal expression of grace and truth, the promised Savior (John 1:17).\u00a0 By his birth he obligated himself to keep the very law he had given (Galatians 4:4-5).\u00a0 Jesus did keep the law perfectly for us (John 8:46; Romans 10:4).\u00a0 He made it very clear that salvation comes through faith in him and not works of the law (John 3:16).\nStill, in his preaching and teaching Jesus did not neglect the law of God.\u00a0 Rather, he highlighted and often illustrated the moral law:\u00a0 showing perfect love toward God and other people (Matthew 22:37-39), even sacrificial love toward others (John 13:34).\u00a0 Re-emphasizing the moral law, along with giving directives such as celebrating the Lord\u2019s Supper (Luke 22:17-20) and baptizing (Matthew 28:19), can be understood as his commands.\u00a0 Finally, his commands are whatever he prescribed as the way of life for his followers.\nPart of Jesus\u2019 mandate to his followers before he ascended into heaven was to teach people everywhere \u201cto obey everything I have commanded you\u201d (Matthew 28:20).\u00a0 We know from Jesus\u2019 own words that we love him when we do what he commands (John 14:15, 21; 15:14)."}

{"prompt": "Religious freedom vs. equality under the law", "completion": "Is religious freedom vs. equality under the law as in the Kim Davis situation an issue whereby we must obey God rather than men, or is the believer subject to obey the law when elected to uphold the law?\n\n\nThe situation you are referencing is a good reminder of how challenging it can be when Christians live in two kingdoms:\u00a0 the church and the state.\u00a0 While God\u2019s word guides life in the church, natural law and human reason are to guide life in the state.\u00a0 Sometimes the state enacts laws that are contrary to natural law and human reason.\u00a0 What then?\u00a0 Is the state, the government, still God\u2019s servant (Romans 13)?\u00a0 Yes, but not a very faithful servant.\u00a0 God requires our respect of and obedience toward government officials not necessarily because they deserve respect and obedience by their actions but because governing authorities owe their existence to God, serving as his representatives.\nChristians who want to serve in the state can do so\u2014even when laws run contrary to God\u2019s word\u2014by recognizing that the state operates on different principles than the church.\u00a0 Moses recognized that.\u00a0 As the leader of the church, he penned under inspiration of the Holy Spirit the establishment of marriage as a lifelong union between a man and a woman (Genesis 2:20-24).\u00a0 As the leader of the state, he wrote certificates of divorce (Matthew 19:3-9) that served to preserve order among Israelite society.\u00a0 A Christian judge might find himself in a similar situation:\u00a0 being in full agreement with the Bible\u2019s teachings of marriage and divorce (perhaps even taking part in a congregational vote on excommunication related to an unscriptural divorce), yet granting an unscriptural divorce in his court.\u00a0 Such actions on his part are not hypocritical; they reflect his involvement as a member of the two kingdoms of church and state that operate with different guiding principles.\nIn the situation you referenced, we are not talking about a judge issuing a final decree of divorce for unscriptural reasons but a county clerk refusing to issue marriage certificates to people whose union is not biblical.\u00a0 While same-sex marriage is ungodly, it is legal in our country.\u00a0 Christians who find themselves in a situation where they are legally bound to issue marriage certificates to people of the same sex can take the approach of Moses or the Christian judge mentioned above, or they may take a different approach because of reasons of conscience.\nHere is where approaches will differ among Christians as they explore various options.\u00a0 One of the options available for the person cited in your question is to seek a different vocation where conscience would not be disturbed.\u00a0 Even though she was elected to her position, she is not forced to continue in her office against her will.\u00a0 It would be very understandable if she resigned for reasons of conscience.\u00a0 It would also be understandable if she followed a different course of action for reasons of conscience and suffered whatever consequences might follow.\nThe bottom line is that there is no easy, one-size-fits-all answer to the question you posed.\u00a0 Christians will prayerfully seek to determine how they can best serve and honor God as citizens of both kingdoms, recognizing the principles that guide each kingdom and applying them as faithfully as they can to their situations."}

{"prompt": "Was Luther anti-Semitic?", "completion": "Was Martin Luther anti-Semitic?  Did he really hate Jews?\n\n\nThe short answer to both your questions is \u201cno.\u201d\u00a0 A longer answer is found in an October 2013 Forward in Christ article.\u00a0 The article addressed the question:\u00a0 \u201cHow can we respond to those who say that Martin Luther was an anti-Semite because of his condemnation of the Jews? My friend thinks that we Lutherans shouldn\u2019t follow such a man.\u201d\u00a0 The following is the response to that question and statement.\nThere are two questions here, one asking why we \u201cfollow Luther\u201d and another asking if Luther was anti-Semitic. Both questions are worth asking and answering.\nHow do Lutherans regard Luther?\nPerhaps uninformed people really think that Lutherans idolize or inappropriately revere Luther. We can assure them we don\u2019t. Rather, we cherish and thankfully embrace key concepts that God restored to their rightful place in the church through Martin Luther. By grace alone, through faith alone, by Scripture alone, and through Christ alone are truths the Reformer championed. Highlight these truths for your friend. This is what true Lutheranism is all about.\nLutherans have never believed or taught everything Luther said or wrote was correct. Luther said and wrote some things that would have better remained unspoken and unwritten. This should not be surprising when one considers how much he wrote. Let\u2019s be quick to cherish divine truths given renewed prominence through Luther and equally swift to acknowledge the man\u2019s imperfections.\nWas Luther an anti-Semite?\nAccusations of anti-Semitism against Luther usually stem from reading his 1543 tract On the Jews and Their Lies, in which the Reformer used immoderate language and gave questionable counsel on how to deal with Jews at that time. While we have never endorsed what and how he wrote in that treatise, we also believe a fair, historically-sensitive appraisal of the man and his message will show the Reformer was not anti-Semitic. Excellent books have been written on this topic, but here we must limit ourselves to these brief points:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Luther also wrote about Jews in sympathetic ways and rebuked European Christians for their treatment of Jews. Here\u2019s one example: \u201cThe fury of some Christians (if they are to be called Christians) is damnable. They imagine that they are doing God a service when they persecute the Jew most hatefully, think everything evil of them, and insult them. . . . Whereas, according to the example of this psalm (14:7) and that of Paul (Romans 9:1), a man ought to be most heartily sorry for them and continually pray for them. . . . They ought to attract them by all manner of gentleness, patience, pleading and care\u201d (What Luther Says: An Anthology, Vol. 2, 683).\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Luther\u2019s attitude is more accurately characterized as anti-Judaism rather than anti-Semitism. His opposition was not racial or ethnic, but theological. He was targeting people who persistently and vigorously rejected the truth of salvation through faith alone in Jesus the Messiah and Savior of the world. Luther wrote harshly against the Roman pope and his theological supporters for the same reason.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Like everyone else, Luther was a child of his times. It\u2019s difficult for people today to put themselves into his historical context, yet it\u2019s unfair to judge him according to our standards of civility. Luther\u2019s language sounds cruel, but his opponents often used similar language, and literary style of the era included harsh ridicule, name calling, and deliberate excess.\nUltimately we must conclude that the treatise in question doesn\u2019t represent Luther at his best. We cannot endorse or excuse what he wrote. From a historical viewpoint, it should not surprise us that he sometimes shared unacceptable attitudes of his day. What is amazing is how often he rose above his times and advocated magnificent and eternal truth, most of all the full and free gospel of forgiveness."}
{"prompt": "\"The Message\" Bible", "completion": "Is there a WELS evaluation of \"The Message\" version of the Bible translated by Eugene Peterson? What I have heard in readings certainly sounds good in English, but I'm wondering if there are other considerations. Thank you!\n\n\nDo keep in mind that the following information is simply a brief personal assessment of The Message.\u00a0 WELS does not have an official list of recommended Bible translations.\nThat being said, The Message is a paraphrase, not what would be understood as a translation.\u00a0 While a translation can contain the biases of the translators, that can happen even more with a paraphrase.\u00a0 It is very easy for the person doing the paraphrasing to incorporate into the finished product ideas and shadings that reflect the person\u2019s own faith.\u00a0 When we understand that The Message is a paraphrase by a (now retired) Presbyterian pastor, we will be interested to see if historic Presbyterian doctrines find their way into his paraphrase.\nAnd so, does his paraphrase indicate consistently that the Lord\u2019s Supper is a holy meal in which Jesus\u2019 body and blood are present in, with and under the bread and wine?\u00a0 He renders 1 Corinthians 11:26-27 (\u201cFor whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord\u2019s death until he comes.\u00a0 So then, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.\u201d) this way:\u00a0 \u201cWhat you must solemnly realize is that every time you eat this bread and every time you drink this cup, you reenact in your words and actions the death of the Master. You will be drawn back to this meal again and again until the Master returns. You must never let familiarity breed contempt.\u00a0 Anyone who eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Master irreverently is like part of the crowd that jeered and spit on him at his death.\u00a0 Is that the kind of \u201cremembrance\u201d you want to be part of?\u201d\u00a0 I do not see the real presence of the Lord\u2019s body and blood in that paraphrase.\nAgain, thinking of historic Presbyterian doctrines, does his paraphrase indicate that people really can fall away from the faith?\u00a0 Jesus\u2019 explanation of the Parable of the Sower teaches:\u00a0 \u201cThose on the rocky ground are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root.\u00a0 They believe for a while, but in the time of testing they fall away\u201d (Luke 8:13).\u00a0 The Message turns the truth of that verse into this:\u00a0 \u201cThe seeds in the gravel are those who hear with enthusiasm, but the enthusiasm doesn\u2019t go very deep. It\u2019s only another fad, and the moment there\u2019s trouble it\u2019s gone.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cEnthusiasm?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cFad?\u201d\u00a0 Or faith?\u00a0 Faith that is lost?\u00a0 1 Timothy 1:19-20 speaks of people who \u201chave suffered shipwreck with regard to their faith,\u201d who have abandoned the truth.\u00a0 The Message says those people \u201cmade a thorough mess of their faith.\u201d\nBeyond these two items, here are a couple of other concerns.\u00a0 Ephesians 2:8-9 teaches beautifully that salvation, including the gift of faith that joins us to Jesus and brings us salvation, is entirely God\u2019s doing.\u00a0 The Message says:\u00a0 \u201cSaving is all his idea, and all his work. All we do is trust him enough to let him do it. [My emphasis] It\u2019s God\u2019s gift from start to finish! We don\u2019t play the major role.\u201d\u00a0 Titus 3:5-6 \u201c[God] saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior\u201d becomes \u201cHe gave us a good bath, and we came out of it new people, washed inside and out by the Holy Spirit.\u201d\u00a0 Time constraints prevent me from sharing more examples where this paraphrase falls short of reliable Bible translations.\nPeople using The Message will need to understand that it is a paraphrase\u2014a retelling of what is in the original Bible languages from the viewpoint of the author.\u00a0 If it is going to be used, it is safest to have a reliable translation alongside it."}

{"prompt": "Faith and good works", "completion": "There are some Bible passages that seem at a first glance to advocate a necessity of obedience or good works for salvation. Why are there so many of such verses? How would you explain in each case why the following Bible verses do not contradict \"sola fide\"?\r\ne.g. Matthew 7:21; 25:31ff; John 5:28; Romans 2:6-8; 1 Corinthians 13:13 (love is greatest); 1 Peter 1:17; 4:8.\r\n\n\n\nContext is so vitally important to understanding Scripture passages.  With context in mind, here is a brief explanation of those passages, showing how they are very much in keeping with the Bible\u2019s teaching that salvation comes through faith alone.\nMatthew 7:21 \u2013 Jesus explains that it is not mere familiarity with him that saves.  What saves is doing the will of his heavenly Father.  What is his heavenly Father\u2019s will?  It is trusting in his Son as Savior (John 6:29, 39, 40).\nMatthew 25:31ff \u2013 Faith in Jesus Christ saves, but faith is alive and active, accompanied by good works (cf. the book of James).  Faith alone saves (Mark 16:16), but saving faith is never alone.\nJohn 5:28-29 \u2013  Similar to the preceding section, people will be judged on the basis of faith or unbelief.  Saving faith will show itself in good works, while unbelief will manifest itself in evil deeds.\nRomans 2:6-8 \u2013 The people in verse 7 are believers.  The people in verse 8 are unbelievers.  Once again, these verses illustrate saving faith and unbelief in action in people\u2019s lives.\n1 Corinthians 13:13 \u2013 The entire thirteenth chapter of 1 Corinthians emphasizes the importance of Christian love.  While the apostle does not specifically explain why love is \u201cthe greatest\u201d of faith, hope and love, we could understand his words in a couple of ways that are consistent with the context of Scripture.  In our relationship to God and others, love becomes very important because it is that quality that emulates the very nature of God (1 John 4:16).  In addition, God\u2019s love for us and our love for him will be eternal.  There is nothing in the verse to undermine the Bible\u2019s consistent teaching of salvation through faith alone.\n1 Peter 1:17 \u2013 Once again, what people do in life (their \u201cwork\u201d) is evidence of what is in their heart:  faith or unbelief.  God will judge what is in the heart, but neither faith nor unbelief resides in a vacuum.\n1 Peter 4:8 \u2013 God is encouraging us in this verse to deal with one another with a loving, forgiving spirit.\nIf there is a theme in the verses you cited, it is that faith and unbelief will give evidence of their existence.  God judges on the basis of what is in the heart.  What is in the heart reveals itself in daily life.  Once again, faith alone saves, but saving faith is never alone."}

Is all rock and roll truly evil?  What does WELS believe about music?  \n\n\n\u201cSo whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God\u201d (1 Corinthians 10:31). That instruction becomes a guiding principle in life, especially when it comes to adiaphora\u2014those things which God has neither commanded nor forbidden.\nSince God has not provided in the Bible a list of acceptable and unacceptable music genres, we are left to apply biblical principles. One of those principles is 1 Corinthians 10:31. Another principle is Philippians 4:8. Music in general can be performed to the glory of God when musicians use their God-given talents with right motives to offer entertainment that is pure. Ephesians 4:29 and 5:4 also provide guidance on what words\u2014spoken or sung\u2014are to come out of our mouths. Sexually explicit or suggestive language in rock, country or any other music genre misses the mark of being pleasing to God. Rather than condemning an entire genre of music, musicians and their music need to be evaluated individually.\n\u201cLet the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts\u201d (Colossians 3:16). Certainly, music that edifies our faith is most important, but there is room in our lives for other genres of music that provide worthwhile entertainment. We find that room in the verse that follows: \u201cAnd whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him\u201d (Colossians 3:17)."}

I am now out of college and still attending our WELS church and love every aspect of it. As I have understood, we have reasons for using hymns and not having a \"worship band\" that plays up front, but I saw a question on this site about a WELS church having a contemporary service and I was wondering if there are, indeed, WELS churches that have a contemporary service and if that consists of modern Christians songs with a worship band? Also, if contemporary services aren't to be practiced in a WELS church, I was wondering if I could have a more in-depth answer for why that is. I vaguely remember why it is, but I've had friends who I've invited to church ask why we don't have that and I'd like to explain it in a better way to them. \n\n\nYes, there are WELS congregations that offer contemporary worship services.\u00a0 Anecdotally-based estimates suggest that less than 10% of WELS congregations offer contemporary worship services in some form.\u00a0 I say \u201cin some form\u201d because congregations define \u201ccontemporary worship\u201d in different ways.\u00a0 To some, contemporary worship means using the liturgy of the hymnal and its hymns but providing accompaniment on musical instruments other than an organ.\u00a0 To others (a much smaller number of congregations), contemporary worship means using a worship band.\nWhy is there variety like this?\u00a0 The answer is Christian freedom.\u00a0 Decisions about worship style are made at the congregational level.\u00a0 What is to guide any form of Christian worship is orderliness (1 Corinthians 14:40) and giving God our best (Isaiah 1; Malachi 1).\u00a0 Recognizing the diversity of the body of Christ (Revelation 7:9) will also lead congregations to conduct worship in ways that reflect the culture(s) of its members.\nRegardless of worship style, our worship is and needs to remain focused on Jesus Christ, the Son of God, our Savior.\u00a0 Our worship is and needs to remain focused on the Triune God.\u00a0 Our worship is and needs to remain focused on the precious gospel of our Lord.\u00a0 When that focus is maintained, then the \u201chow\u201d of worship can be kept in proper perspective."}

{"prompt": "Communion practice", "completion": "I was born, raised, baptized and confirmed in the Lutheran church, LCMS. We have been attending a WELS church in our area and did receive Communion, but the elders then said we cannot receive Communion unless we were members of that particular congregation. We like this church but are now confused and are not sure about becoming members. What is the WELS stance on Communion for other Lutherans?\n\n\nElsewhere on this website, in a statement of our faith titled This We Believe, you can read: \u201c5. We believe that God directs believers to acknowledge oneness in faith with Christians whose confession of faith submits to all the teachings of Scripture (John 8:31; 1 Thessalonians 5:21,22). We believe, furthermore, that individuals through their membership in a church body commit themselves to the doctrine and practice of that church. To assert that unity exists where there is no agreement in confession is to presume to look into people\u2019s hearts. Only God can look into people\u2019s hearts. It is not necessary that all Christians agree on matters of church ritual or organization. About these the New Testament gives no commands (Romans 14:17).\n\u201c6. We believe that those whose confession of faith reveals that they are united in the doctrines of Scripture will express their fellowship in Christ as occasion permits (Ephesians 4:3). They may express their fellowship by joint worship, by joint proclamation of the gospel, by joining in Holy Communion, by joint prayer, and by joint church work. God directs believers not to practice religious fellowship with those whose confession and actions reveal that they teach, tolerate, support, or defend error (2 John 10,11). When error appears in the church, Christians will try to preserve their fellowship by patiently admonishing the offenders, in the hope that they will turn from their error (2 Timothy 2:25,26; Titus 3:10). But the Lord commands believers not to practice church fellowship with people who persist in teaching or adhering to beliefs that are false (Romans 16:17,18).\u201d\nFollowing scriptural guidelines, our normal practice is to commune only members of our congregations and individuals who belong to congregations in fellowship with WELS.\nOn paper, The Lutheran Church\u2014Missouri Synod has a communion practice that parallels that of WELS:\u00a0 \u201c In keeping with the principle that the celebration and reception of the Lord\u2019s Supper is a confession of the unity of faith, while at the same time recognizing that there will be instances when sensitive pastoral care needs to be exercised, the Synod has established an official practice requiring \u2018that pastors and congregations of The Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod, except in situations of emergency and in special cases of pastoral care, commune individuals of only those synods which are now in fellowship with us.\u2019\u00a0 By following this practice whereby only those individuals who are members of the Synod or of a church body with which the Synod is in altar and pulpit fellowship are ordinarily communed, pastors and congregations preserve the integrity of their witness to the Gospel of Christ as it is revealed in the Scriptures and confessed in the Lutheran confessional writings.\u201d (\u201cTheology and Practice of the Lord\u2019s Supper.\u201d\u00a0 A Report of the Commission on Theology and Church Relations of The Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod. )\nIt would be good for you to have a conversation with the pastor of the congregation you have been attending.\u00a0 He is in a position to explain these matters in more detail."}

What should and should not be included in the service folder? Since genealogists use obituaries as a source of information about a person, should the newspaper account differ from that used in church, where to list a person's accomplishments seems to put works before grace? I've spoken to a number of people on this subject recently while attending funerals, and we all agree that we need some guidelines.\n\n\nI am not sure what funeral service plans you have in mind that were not approved by a pastor.\u00a0 I can only guess that perhaps people, on their own, made the request in their plans to have certain friends or family members serve as musicians or officiants in the funeral service.\u00a0 Then, when the time came for those plans to be implemented, family members were surprised to learn that those individuals would not be able to serve in those capacities after all because they are outside our fellowship.\nOtherwise, pastors will work with the suggested hymns and Bible readings.\u00a0 Pastors will receive information from families and gauge what biographical information is to be included in the funeral worship service folder.\u00a0 Local practice will determine to what degree the content of a newspaper obituary aligns with the service folder information.\nYour question about funeral service planning is a good reminder of what we all can do to make a challenging time less stressful for our loved ones.\u00a0 Different organizations do provide funeral planning guides, as you noted.\u00a0 I would like to make you aware of one that is included in a packet of information from WELS Ministry of Christian Giving.\u00a0 The document is called \u201cEstate Planning for the Christian Steward\u201d and is available via this link.\u00a0 (Scroll down to File C once you land on the website page.)\u00a0 Pages 25-27 of the document have application to your questions.\nCongregations would do well to encourage their members to make funeral plans, submit them to their pastor for review and have the plans filed at the church office.\u00a0 Again, that preliminary work can make a challenging time for loved ones less stressful."}

{"prompt": "Why no women pastors?", "completion": "Why doesn't the WELS have women pastors?\n\n\nWe do not have women pastors because that would go against what the Bible says.\u00a0 In This We Believe, a statement of belief of our church body, we confess this:\u00a0 \u201c8. We believe that God has also established the public ministry of the Word (Ephesians 4:11), and it is the will of God that the church, in accordance with good order (1 Corinthians 14:40), call qualified individuals into this public ministry (1 Timothy 3:1-10; 1 Corinthians 9:14). Such individuals minister publicly, that is, not because as individuals they possess the universal priesthood but because they are asked to do this in the name of fellow Christians (Romans 10:15). These individuals are the called servants of Christ and ministers of the gospel. They are not to be lords over God\u2019s church (1 Peter 5:3). We believe that when the church calls individuals into this public ministry, the Lord himself is acting through the church (Acts 20:28). We believe that the church has the freedom to establish various forms within the one ministry of the Word, such as pastors, Christian teachers, and staff ministers. Through its call, the church in Christian liberty designates the place and scope of service.\n\u201c9. We believe that the church\u2019s mission is to serve people with the Word and sacraments. This service is usually done in local congregations. We look upon the pastoral office as the most comprehensive form of the public ministry of the Word. Pastors are trained and called to provide such comprehensive spiritual oversight for the gathering and nurturing of souls in congregations (1 Peter 5:2).\n\u201c10. We believe that women may participate in offices and activities of the public ministry except where that work involves authority over men (1 Timothy 2:11,12). This means that women may not serve as pastors nor participate in assemblies of the church in ways that exercise authority over men (1 Corinthians 11:3; 14:33-35).\u201d\nYou can read the paragraphs that were cited in context via this link.\u00a0 While the Bible prohibits women from the pastoral office, they enjoy equal status with men in the kingdom of God (Galatians 3:26-29)."}

I see God as more likely to help a \"bird with a broken wing\" than to take pleasure in its sacrifice.

This made me wonder, though, if they did not have baptism back then, then what brought David's son and other children soul-saving faith? \r\nAlso, what if a child of believers who planned to baptize the child is stillborn?\n\n\nWhile some Bible commentators interpret David\u2019s words as stated in your question, David\u2019s words in context mean that he, like his son, would die one day and not return to this world.\nThe gospel is what the Holy Spirit has always used to bring people to faith.\u00a0 For people in Old Testament times, the gospel message looked forward to the Messiah who would come into the world.\u00a0 For people in New Testament times like us, the gospel looks backs to the Messiah, Jesus of Nazareth, who came into the world to fulfill all prophecy.\nThe Bible does not specifically address your second question.\u00a0 We know that from conception people are sinful and in need of a Savior (Psalm 51:5), and that the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23).\u00a0 We know that Jesus came into the world to save all people (John 3:16), including children (Luke 18:15-16).\u00a0 God has revealed to us that he creates and sustains faith through the gospel in word and sacrament (Romans 10:14-17).\u00a0 We know that in the case of John the Baptist God worked in the heart of an unborn child, but that was in fulfillment of a specific prophecy (Luke 1:15).\u00a0 Going beyond this revealed information would be speculation on my part.\nChristian parents who lost a child before the opportunity to baptize would not in any way be guilty of despising the sacrament God wanted them to use.\u00a0 In such situations, Christian parents entrust their child to the care of a gracious God whose ways and wisdom far transcend ours (Romans 11:33-36)."}

We know that Catholics are baptized as infants also, and receive faith in their Savior as a result.  We also know that it is not necessary to get baptized again, if they become Lutheran.  From here, it gets 'fuzzy' as far as what the Roman Catholics believe and whether they are saved or not.  If a Catholic, through the church's teaching, was led to believe that  he is required to do 'good works'  in order to maintain salvation, this is indeed a false teaching, yet he received the same Holy Spirit we received at baptism.   Then, it is the church's teaching that is 'corrupt' and I guess my question is, \"Is this a way for a person to 'lose' his salvation, through his own false beliefs?  Is this a good example of having our own 'will' in deciding what is true or false?  What if a person believes this teaching out of ignorance?  \r\nI would appreciate it if you could clarify this.  I do know that God is the judge of all and he only can read our hearts, and whether we are truly 'dependent on Him.'\n\n\nYou have a correct understanding:\u00a0 the Holy Spirit can plant saving faith in a person\u2019s heart, but then that faith can become corrupted by a person believing the false teachings of a church or believing the false teachings that arise from the person\u2019s own thinking.\u00a0 While ignorance of Scripture may explain why a person has a misguided faith, it does not exempt the person from being accountable to God.\nAll this is reason why you and I need to keep sharing the truths of Scripture with others.\u00a0 \u201cFor we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law\u201d (Romans 3:28).\u00a0 \u201cFor it is by grace you have been saved, through faith\u2014and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God\u2014 not by works, so that no one can boast\u201d (Ephesians 2:8-9).\u00a0 God bless your ongoing testimony!"}

No one could go to the town clerk of Bethlehem to find a birth certificate. The records, if there were any, may have been part of the Roman census, but they were gone. Could anyone suggest the day he was born?\n\u201cClearly, the answer to that question is no. But Christians in the third century felt that the coming of Jesus occurred on the day that God created the world. Really? Who knew that? Well, the cycle of seasons always began with the first day of spring and the coming of new life. So the first day of spring was also considered the day God created the world. For these people, spring began on March 25. Some adopted that date for the birth of Jesus, but others began to adopt that day as the day that Jesus was conceived. If you count nine months from March 25, you come to Dec. 25.\u201d\nThe fact of the matter is that we do not know the date of Jesus\u2019 birth.\u00a0 That is not a problem.\u00a0 This is what we do know:\u00a0 \u201cThis is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about\u2026\u201d (Matthew 1:18-25)\u00a0 God bless your Christmas celebration."}

I am told by the church I grew up in that I cannot sing at my mother's funeral. She was a life-long member. What is the thought process here? I am just being told no - that is the way it is. \n\n\nMay the risen Lord bring you comfort and strength by assuring you that those die in the Lord are forevermore blessed (Revelation 14:13).\nThere is, of course, no Bible passage that addresses your question specifically.\u00a0 That is, there is no Bible passage that states specifically who can and who cannot sing at a funeral service.\u00a0 What the Bible does present are broad principles of fellowship that we then need to apply to specific situations like funerals and weddings, and worship services in general.\nThe Bible does encourage us to work together with those who have a common faith, and to work together to promote the truth (3 John 8).\u00a0 At the same time God, through the Bible, tells us to separate from and not join in fellowship activities like worship with those who are not one in faith with us (Romans 16:17; Titus 3:10; 2 John 10-11).\nIn the situation you describe, the difficulty is that you have membership in a congregation of a synod with which WELS is not in fellowship.\u00a0 Your prior membership in a WELS congregation or the family connection to the funeral service does not override biblical fellowship principles.\nWhen you joined a congregation of the Lutheran Church\u2014Missouri Synod, you became part of a church body that is not in fellowship with WELS.\u00a0 As your synod and WELS are not in fellowship with one another, it is not possible for you to take a leadership role in a worship service in a WELS congregation.\nThis is not an indictment of your personal faith.\u00a0 Whenever I answer questions like this, I try to emphasize the difference between visible churches and the invisible church, the Holy Christian Church.\u00a0 WELS and LCMS congregations are visible churches.\u00a0 If an LCMS member is not able to sing a song at a funeral or receive Communion in a WELS congregation, in no way are we saying that the LCMS member is not a Christian, nor are we pretending to read what is in the individual\u2019s heart.\u00a0 We are happy when a person\u2019s sincere confession of Christian faith identifies him/her as a member of the Holy Christian Church, the invisible church.\u00a0 But only God knows who belongs to that Church; you and I operate in the realm of visible churches.\u00a0 So, while we may have a common membership in the Holy Christian Church with other Christians, their membership in a visible church outside our fellowship prevents us from doing the things we might like\u2014like singing at a funeral service.\nYou may or may not be aware that representatives of WELS and LCMS, along with the Evangelical Lutheran Synod, have had informal discussions in the past several years to clarify where there is and is not doctrinal agreement.\u00a0 The report closes with these thoughts:\u00a0 \u201cPerhaps God may guide us to a reestablishment of fellowship at some point in the future, a goal for which we pray and work. But even if we are not able to practice church fellowship, we have found benefit in talking together about church work, in patiently trying to understand the issues better, and in providing a measure of encouragement in our lives of repentance and fidelity to Scripture.\u201d\u00a0 Again, may Jesus, \u201cthe resurrection and the life\u201d (John 11:25), bring you comfort and strength through his gospel."}

Some view this as incorrect application of the headship/helper principle while others view it as an adiaphora/Christian freedom because that position does not exercise authority. \n\n\nYou and your congregation are experiencing firsthand how churches study God\u2019s word to understand and apply scriptural principles to their organizational life.\u00a0 God has established a role relationship for men and women.\u00a0 Men are to exercise authority as a loving head and women are to use their God-given gifts as a loving helper (Genesis 2:18; 1 Corinthians 11:3,8; 1 Timothy 2:11-13).\u00a0 Together, men and women\u2014enjoying perfect equality in God\u2019s family (Galatians 3:26-29)\u2014serve their Lord and one another.\u00a0 By specific job descriptions (which I do not have in your case) congregations spell out what authority is given to committee and board members and the individuals overseeing or coordinating their work.\nThere is a section in A Bible Study on Man and Woman in God\u2019s Word that you might find helpful.\u00a0 In answering the question \u201cWhat roles may women fill in the leadership and administration of the church?\u201d there is this response:\n\u201cWomen should not serve in offices of the church which have governing authority in the church and responsibility for discipline, such as elder and councilman.\u00a0 If such administrative tasks as treasurer and financial secretary are service positions separated from governing responsibility for the church, there is no reason women may not serve in such positions.\u00a0 Women can certainly function as evangelists, teachers, counselors, and visitors of the sick if their service in these areas is in harmony with the scriptural principles of headship and submission\u2026If the \u2018evangelism committee\u2019 consists of everyone who is trained to make evangelism calls, there is no reason women may not serve on such a committee.\u00a0 However, supervising authority and responsibility for congregational policy must rest with the governing boards of the congregation.\n\u201c\u2026it would be wise to use terminology that distinguishes the roles of various groups, such as governing boards and service committees.\u00a0 Distinctions of terminology should reflect genuine distinctions of function.\u00a0 They should not be imaginary distinctions, designed to evade scriptural principle.\u00a0 Calling a group a \u2018service committee\u2019 when in reality it acts as a governing board and policy-making group, perhaps with rubber stamp approval from the church council, would be a deception aimed at evading God\u2019s will.\n\u201c\u2026The key questions are, \u2018[Are women] being asked to serve in a way which is in harmony with scriptural principle?\u2019 and \u2018Are we giving a clear testimony concerning our adherence to the scriptural principles?\u2019\u201d (p. 41)\nFinally, you may or may not be aware that each district of our synod has a committee for constitutional matters which is charged with reviewing and approving revisions to congregational constitutions and bylaws.\u00a0 Whatever revisions to the bylaws your congregation adopts will be reviewed by the committee in your district.\u00a0 God bless your congregation and the work of its men and women."}

I'll then get the response, \"The Bible also says you shouldn't judge other people.\" \r\nNow, I realize that Matthew 7:1 says \"Do not judge.\" But we, as Christians, also have the responsibility to rebuke people, out of love, for their wrongdoings and lead them on a righteous path. I believe that by telling people of their wrongdoings, as a part of an effort to lead them to a righteous lifestyle, that I am doing the right thing.\r\nSo what exactly does it mean to \"judge\"? At what point does my loving rebuke become a sinful judgment?\r\n\n\n\nThere are several things to consider with your question.\nRather than seeing a wide divide between judging and rebuking, there is some overlap.\u00a0 Jesus said, \u201cIf your brother or sister sins against you, rebuke them; and if they repent, forgive them\u201d (Luke 17:3).\u00a0 How do I know if someone has sinned?\u00a0 I have to make a judgment, don\u2019t I?\u00a0 I have to compare what a person said or did with God\u2019s word.\u00a0 That is a judgment, an outward judgment, and the kind we are to make.\nJesus also said, \u201cIf your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault, just between the two of you\u201d (Matthew 18:15).\u00a0 Again, a judgment of the person\u2019s action needs to be made.\nIt is clear that Jesus did not forbid all judging.\u00a0 He forbade hypocritical judging (Matthew 7:1-5) and judging of the heart:\u00a0 one\u2019s motives and one\u2019s thoughts.\nWhen we do rebuke others out of love, it is not uncommon to hear that person respond by saying, \u201cDon\u2019t judge.\u00a0 Jesus said you are not to judge.\u201d\u00a0 That inaccurate response can be a defense mechanism whereby the person being rebuked tries to blunt the message of God\u2019s law and\u00a0 uphold a view toward life that is different from God\u2019s.\nIncidentally, when people counter your rebuke with a \u201cDon\u2019t judge.\u201d response, they are judging.\u00a0 They are judging what you said with an inaccurate idea they have about the Bible.\u00a0 Their judgment is that you are in the wrong.\u00a0 You are not.\nA simple answer to your question is that a loving rebuke becomes a sinful judgment if your rebuke is in any way associated with the attempt to judge another person\u2019s heart.\nYou may be interested to know that I did answer a similar question in a \u201cLight for our path\u201d column.\u00a0 This link will take you to the column.\nContinue to speak \u201cthe truth in love\u201d (Ephesians 4:15).\u00a0 Do that so others may hear the truth of God\u2019s word, believe the truth through the power of the Holy Spirit and then live the truth."}

{"prompt": "Acceptable to eat \"halal\" meat?", "completion": "As a Lutheran in this current time, should we steer clear of \"halal\" meat--considering that part of the preparation of this meat includes invoking Allah?  And especially in light of (at least here in the USA) the abundance of non-halal foods?\n\n\nHalal is an Arabic word meaning \u201cpermissible.\u201d\u00a0 Halal meat comes from animals that have slaughtered in keeping with Islamic laws of the Qur\u2019an.\u00a0 Included in the slaughter process is a ritual with prayer to Allah or the mention of his name.\u00a0 \u201cCan Christians eat such meat?\u201d you wonder.\nThe situation associated with your\u00a0 question is similar to what the apostle Paul addressed in 1 Corinthians.\u00a0 In ancient Corinth meat that had been associated with pagan worship practices was available for sale in the marketplace.\u00a0 Some Christians believed it would be wrong if they bought and ate that meat.\u00a0 Other Christians were convinced there was nothing wrong with the meat.\nHow did the apostle handle the situation?\u00a0 For starters, he reminded the Corinthians that there is only one God\u2014the God of the Bible, the Triune God:\u00a0 \u201cWe know that \u2018An idol is nothing at all in the world\u2019 and that \u2018There is no God but one\u2019\u201d (1 Corinthians 8:4).\u00a0 The food that had been sacrificed to idols was perfectly fine because, as Paul pointed out, idols do not exist.\u00a0 Similarly, meat today slaughtered in the name of a false god is not tainted, because the god of Islam does not exist.\n\u201cBut not everyone possesses this knowledge. Some people are still so accustomed to idols that when they eat sacrificial food they think of it as having been sacrificed to a god, and since their conscience is weak, it is defiled\u201d (1 Corinthians 8:7).\u00a0 Whether we are talking about ancient Corinth or 21st century America, if Christians believe it is wrong for them to eat meat that has been associated with idolatrous worship practices, then it is wrong for them.\u00a0 The apostle Paul reminded the Christians in Rome of that same truth:\u00a0 \u201cBut if anyone regards something as unclean, then for that person it is unclean\u201d (Romans 14:14).\u00a0 When a person\u2019s conscience has labeled something as \u201csin,\u201d that person needs to keep the law the conscience has established, or else the person sins against his or her conscience (Romans 14:22-23).\nOn the other hand, Christians who recognize their freedom in buying and eating meat associated with idolatrous practices can consume that product without sinning.\u00a0 At the same time, such Christians will exercise their Christian freedom with a loving eye toward those whose consciences are guiding them in a different direction.\u00a0 This is where the apostle Paul\u2019s instruction comes into play:\u00a0 \u201cBe careful, however, that the exercise of your rights does not become a stumbling block to the weak\u201d (1 Corinthians 8:9).\nSo, you \u201cshould steer clear of halal meat\u201d if your conscience is telling you to do that.\u00a0 If it is not, you can purchase it\u2014again, with a loving concern for those Christians who do not agree with you.\nI will provide a similar response to your question in a future \u201cLight for our path\u201d column in Forward in Christ."}

{"prompt": "Prayers in worship services and personal life", "completion": "How does the WELS promote active participation in prayer? Much of our service is so scripted (all for good reason I know) and so are additional prayers for before and after Communion, baptism, opening/ close of day, or before dinner. I think back to my WELS grade school days - our devotions and our Christ-Light book prayers were scripted as well. It is one thing to have prayer examples so that something important in our prayers to God aren't missed, but I'll speak for myself, and likely others, that it is so repeated that sometimes I fail to focus, to listen, and truly pray from the heart. I can't help but see a disconnect. My point is that the WELS is near and dear to my heart, and has given me a heart for Jesus, but I believe that we aren't taught to actively pray to the Lord. I don't understand why other denominations or non-denominational individuals feel so free to pray off the cuff. Are there any initiatives on this? If not, I'm strongly interested in hearing your comments. Thank you!\n\n\nMy response will address \u201cprepared prayers\u201d in worship services and the teaching of prayer in general.\u00a0 I hope that is adequate.\nYou already acknowledge good reason for \u201cscripting\u201d parts of our worship service.\u00a0 In Christian freedom our pastors\u2014in worship services\u2014can offer prayers that they or others have written ahead of time, or they can speak prayers that are not written out.\u00a0 While many pastors offer ex corde prayers in settings such as meetings, Bible classes, visits to hospitals, nursing homes and private residences, they often prepare prayers as part of their general worship service preparation.\u00a0 Such prayer preparation can offer the same advantage as writing out the sermon:\u00a0 the pastor will be able to choose his words ahead of time, and there is less likelihood of using the same words and phrases.\u00a0 In addition, this preparation can reduce and eliminate the worshipers\u2019 uncomfortableness and sense of awkwardness when the person praying is trying to find the right words.\nOn the other hand, there are pastors who can offer ex corde prayers week after week in worship services with freshness and variety, and with ease.\u00a0 For them, printed prayers are a luxury more than a necessity for their role as worship leader.\nI have used the terminology ex corde without explaining it for others who may read your question and this response.\u00a0 Ex corde refers to praying \u201cfrom the heart,\u201d when there is no printed prayer in front of a person.\u00a0 Obviously I have no problem with that definition.\u00a0 What can concern me is when people think an ex corde prayer is more spiritual\u2014or better\u2014than a prayer that has been written out\u2014by the person praying or by someone else.\u00a0 That is when I like to say this:\u00a0 even when I use a prayer that someone else wrote, that is as much of a prayer \u201cfrom the heart\u201d as the prayers that are called \u201cex corde.\u201d\u00a0 And, incidentally, using prayers written by others will often take me out of my own little world and lead me to pray for other people and for other things.\nRegarding the teaching of prayer in WELS, I can only comment on what I see and hear.\u00a0 When I go through the book of James with college students, I ask them what others have taught them about prayer:\u00a0 how to have a balanced prayer life in offering \u201cprayers, petitions, intercession, and thanksgiving\u2026for all people (2 Timothy 2:1).\u00a0 I regularly hear acronyms and memory hooks that can guide them in their prayer life.\nCould we do better in our teaching and modeling of Christian prayer?\u00a0 Certainly.\u00a0 We can do better and grow in all aspects of our Christian life.\nWhat we want to keep teaching is that prayer is the privilege God has given us whereby we can speak to him; prayer is a conversation we have with God.\u00a0 He speaks to us through the word, and we speak to him in prayer.\u00a0\u00a0 Because of God\u2019s invitation to pray and his promise to hear and answer our prayers, we can come boldly to him with our \u201cprayers, petitions, intercession, and thanksgiving.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "What does \"for Jesus' sake\" mean?", "completion": "I often read in Christian publications and in our own WELS literature the phrase \"for Jesus' sake.\"  This often appears at the end of written prayers and in the prayers said at the altar in my home church.  I really bristle at this.  For Jesus' sake?  Really?  He is holy and gave us eternal life through His holy blood.  Jesus doesn't need us to pray for him.  It is we poor sinners who need prayers of intercession.  As a life-long WELS member, I finally have to ask, what does this phrase mean, as I obviously am missing the meaning?\n\n\nYour question illustrates how words can have multiple meanings.\u00a0 \u201cSake\u201d can mean \u201cfor the benefit of\u201d or \u201con account of.\u201d\nThe expression \u201cfor Jesus\u2019 sake\u201d at the end of prayers does not intend to say that we are praying for (\u201cfor the benefit of\u201d) Jesus.\u00a0 \u201cFor Jesus\u2019 sake\u201d means that we are coming to God in prayer, not pleading our own merits, but (\u201con account of\u201d) Jesus\u2019 merits.\nJesus said, \u201cI am the way and the truth and the life.\u00a0 No one comes to the Father except through me\u201d (John 14:6).\u00a0 When we end our prayers with \u201cfor Jesus\u2019 sake,\u201d we are acknowledging that Jesus is the one who has bridged the gap between a holy God and sinners.\u00a0 \u201cFor Jesus\u2019 sake\u201d has the idea of asking that our prayers be heard and answered, not because of who we are but because of who Jesus is.\u00a0 And of course whether or not we use that expression, that thought is foundational to all our prayers.\nSo, keep presenting your \u201crequests, prayers and intercession\u201d (1 Timothy 2:1) to God.\u00a0 God will hear and answer your prayers for Jesus\u2019 sake, because he has \u201creconciled us to himself through Christ\u201d (2 Corinthians 5:18)."}

{"prompt": "Angels and Satan", "completion": "I had a conversation with a Christian recently (not sure of her denomination) who has two beliefs for which I can't find a scriptural basis. One is that angels are sent by God, but we must ask for their help before they will intervene in our lives - almost as though they are just standing by, waiting to be called up by us. The other is that by blessing a building and writing a series of numbers and letters above an entryway with chalk (which she does annually) she can \"keep the Devil out.\"  Are these some kind of distortion of Scripture, or am I just uninformed? Thank you.\n\n\nAngels are \u201cministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation\u201d (Hebrews 1:14). While God can certainly direct his holy angels to action in our lives as an answer to our prayers, there is nothing in the Bible that says \u201cwe must ask for their help before they will intervene in our lives.\u201d And aren\u2019t we glad that is the case? If we always had to ask for their help, would we remember to ask? Would we be timely in remembering to ask for help before danger struck? We enjoy many blessings of God even before we ask for them (Isaiah 65:24). God tells us he is the one who orchestrates his holy angels into action for the good of his children (Psalm 91:11).\nRegarding your second question, the letter and number writing can easily come across to someone as a superstitious practice. How do we \u201ckeep the devil out\u201d of our lives? We cannot eliminate him entirely from our earthly lives, but we do have this instruction and promise: \u201cResist the devil, and he will flee from you\u201d (James 4:7). We resist Satan with the spiritual armament God provides (Ephesians 6:10-18). The great Reformation hymn reminds us how powerful that weaponry is in the battle against Satan: \u201cOne little word can fell him\u201d (Christian Worship 200:3)."}

{"prompt": "Moral lives of unbelievers and lives of Christians", "completion": "How do you answer someone who says that their atheist friend is more moral and upright than some of their Christian friends?  Where do moral values differ from an atheist to a Christian if at all?\n\n\nThe answer is understanding the difference between unbelievers who do nice things and Christians who do good works.\nUnbelievers can be motivated to do nice things and be good citizens (we call that \u201ccivic righteousness\u201d) for a variety of reasons. Like all people, they know from creation that there is a God (Romans 1:19-20; Hebrews 3:4). Like all people, they naturally know right from wrong and they have a conscience that, unless it is dulled or completely obliterated, convicts them when they do wrong (Romans 2:14-15). Unbelievers may be motivated to do nice things to gain recognition from people, to stay out of trouble, to create an atmosphere of cooperation among others, or any other number of reasons.\nNon-Christians can be motivated, like all people by nature, to do nice things in the hope that they can influence God and somehow receive his reward.\nWhile unbelievers may be motivated to do nice things in life, those nice things remain simply nice things. God is not impressed by them. In fact, it is quite the opposite. Scripture says: \u201cEverything that does not come from faith is sin\u201d (Romans 14:23).\nOn the other hand, because of the power of God in their hearts and lives, Christians are able to do good works that are acceptable to God because of Jesus his Son (Ephesians 2:10; Philippians 2:13). Good works are the things Christians do to thank God for their salvation. God\u2019s word serves as a guideline, explaining what good things Christians can do to direct their praise to God.\nIn the eyes of the world, might it appear that an unbeliever\u2019s nice things are more numerous than a Christian\u2019s good works? That could be the case. Such a comparison might be between an unbeliever who is a good citizen and neighbor, and a Christian whose sinful nature is showing itself more than the new self.\nWhat we cannot do is be fooled by what we see. Nice things and good works are on \u201cthe outside.\u201d Faith and unbelief are matters of the heart. \u201cWhoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned\u201d (Mark 16:16). Because of their gratitude for God\u2019s free gift of salvation, Christians have every reason to do good in life (Colossians 3:17).\nGod\u2019s desire is that his children let their \u201clight shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven\u201d (Matthew 5:16). When we let our light shine, others may become interested in Jesus Christ and be brought to faith by the Holy Spirit through the gospel. When that happens, then the nice things those former unbelievers now do become good works in God\u2019s sight because they stem from hearts that are filled with Christian faith and they are prompted by proper motivation."}
{"prompt": "Feeling distant from God", "completion": "I have had Christian education from kindergarten through high school. Now I am studying at a private university with no religious affiliation. I was surprised to see how different people behaved when I first went to college. I've been through the ups and downs, but I got used to this contempt for moral behavior and Christianity. However, I've been recently feeling like God isn't here. It seems like he is so far away. I go to a nearby WELS church every Sunday, but it feels like I can only \"find\" God and the message of Christ there. What words of comfort can you offer me for this feeling of distance from God six days a week?\n\n\nYour scenario underscores the importance of personal Bible study. Worshiping with fellow Christians on Sunday is good encouragement for Christians (Hebrews 10:25). But just as we would not expect one meal to sustain us for a week, so it is not realistic to expect one feeding from God\u2019s gospel to carry us through the week.\nWhat you will want to do is supplement your Sunday worship with regular Bible readings and devotions. (Perhaps you are doing that already, but that was not part of the information you provided.)\nHere is where there are many resources at your disposal. This link will take you to the area of the synod\u2019s web site where you can sign up for daily email devotions. You could look on the web sites of Martin Luther College and Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary for live-streamed and archived devotions. This link will take you to the Campus Ministry section of our synod\u2019s web site. You can sign up there to receive materials. Finally, talk to the pastor of the congregation where you are worshiping as a student. Perhaps he knows of a WELS campus ministry that exists nearby. Or, maybe he can put you in touch with other students at your university who are united with you in faith.\nAbove all, keep close to God through regular reading and study of his word. Through his word the Lord will assure you of his continual presence in your life. \u201cGod has said, \u2018Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you\u2019\u201d (Hebrews 13:5). \u201cAnd surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age\u201d (Matthew 28:20).

I know that I still need to evaluate everything they are saying against the truth of the Bible, but am I okay to still take away positive messages from them that I can apply to my life? I found these organizations because I was craving more Christian content in my life but I am not sure where the line is. I know that I should not participate in prayer with them but what about singing along to their songs, and applying their messages, take- aways to my life?

{"prompt": "Origin of concept of triune God", "completion": "When did the concept of a triune God come into being?\r\n\n\n\nThere never was a beginning to the triune God\u2019s existence. God is eternal, without beginning and without end (Psalm 90:2).\nPeople came to a knowledge of the unique nature of God when God revealed that in his word\u2014as early as the first verse of the Bible: \u201cIn the beginning God created the heavens and the earth\u201d (Genesis 1:1). In the original Hebrew, \u201cGod\u201d in that verse is plural in form. That is a tip-off right there to the plurality of persons in the Godhead.\nLater in the chapter \u201cGod said, \u2018Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground\u2019\u201d (Genesis 1:26). Note the plural pronouns in that verse.\nAs time went on, God revealed more information about himself as a triune God. That information became clearest in the New Testament, with these words from Jesus\u2019 great commission: \u201cTherefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit\u2026\u201d (Matthew 28:19).\nThe eternal God is triune. We know that because he has revealed that information to us in his word."}
{"prompt": "Souls in heaven aware of events on earth?", "completion": "Can souls in heaven see what happens on earth?\n\n\nThe Bible does not reveal much information about the existence of individuals between the time of death and the last day. We do know from the Bible that when people die, body and soul separate from one another, and they either enjoy the glories of heaven or experience the horrors of hell based on faith in Jesus Christ or unbelief.\nAs the Bible describes heaven as a place of perfect joy and peace (Psalm 16:11; Revelation 21:4), one wonders how souls in heaven could have that perfect joy and peace if they were able to see the sinful things that happen on earth. Some point to passages like Psalm 88:10-12; Ecclesiastes 9:10; and, Isaiah 63:16 for support that souls are not aware of what happens on earth.\nWhat souls in heaven do see is their Savior God (Philippians 1:23). They will see him face-to-face forever (1 John 3:1-2). That is something Christians eagerly anticipate!"}
{"prompt": "How could God hate Esau?", "completion": "God loves the whole world.  John 3:16:  \"For God so loved the world...\"  So how can he hate Esau?  Malachi 1:3 \"but Esau I have hated.\" \n\n\nJohn 3:16 does beautifully describe the gospel message: the message of God\u2019s love for sinners. What kind of God would love sinners? The only God, the God who \u201cis love\u201d (1 John 4:16).\nAnd yet, the Bible tells us that the God of love who loves sinners also hates sin and hates sinners (Psalm 5:5). That is the message of the law. The messages of the law and the gospel are not contradictory messages; they are different messages.\nIf Esau died without saving faith, the verse from Malachi you cited could reference God\u2019s declaration of an unbeliever on the last day. On the other hand, the verse you cited could describe how God lovingly treated two individuals in different ways. Let me explain.\nTo the Jews of Malachi\u2019s day who grumbled about the lack of love on God\u2019s part (Malachi 1:2), God reminded them that he had showed generous, undeserved love to their ancestor Jacob by overriding the normal order of the birthright, taking that blessing from Esau and giving it to Jacob. In that sense, God \u201chated\u201d Esau in much the same way as when Jesus instructed people to \u201chate\u201d members of their family: \u201cIf anyone comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters\u2014yes, even their own life\u2014such a person cannot be my disciple\u201d (Luke 14:26). \u201cHatred\u201d there too speaks of a lesser degree of love.\nThe verse from Malachi that you quoted can be understood in different ways. However, it cannot be understood to mean that God, from eternity, chose Esau to be condemned. That is not the God of the Bible. The Triune God does not want \u201canyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance\u201d (2 Peter 3:9). He \u201cwants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth\u201d (1 Timothy 2:4)."}
{"prompt": "Family members in heaven", "completion": "I understand that when God brings us to heaven solely through Jesus' merit we will experience perfect joy and happiness basking in the glory of the Lord.  I also realize that marriage is an earthly institution only.  However, I am troubled by the concept that my wife and children will be no more special to me than some other believer that I never met.  What am I missing?\n\n\nYou are correct in understanding that the Bible speaks of marriage as \u201can earthly institution only\u201d (Matthew 22:30). What the Bible does not do is provide many details on the eternal life we will enjoy with God and fellow believers.\nSome point to the account of Jesus\u2019 transfiguration (Matthew 17:1-13; Mark 9:2-13; Luke 9:28-36), where Peter, James and John recognized Moses and Elijah for who they were on earth, as an indication that in heaven we will appreciate greatly those fellow believers who were earthly family members. Others refer to 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 to demonstrate that God will bring together his believers of all time. And that certainly includes family members. Passages like these can suggest that earthly family members will indeed be \u201cspecial\u201d to us in heaven. But of course, our God will be our number one love (Revelation 5).\nAny specific questions about our eternal life that the Bible does not answer now are addressed in general by these words: \u201cDear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when Christ appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is\u201d (1 John 3:2). How we long for that day!"}

Would you please give me the Bible verses that say that?\r\nAlso, my daughter is in to Joyce Meyer Ministries. How does the WELS recognize her and her teachings?  Thank you and God bless you.\n\n\nBible verses that address your question are: 1 Corinthians 11:3; 14:33-35; and, 1 Timothy 2:1-3:13.\nOur synod does not have an official evaluation of ministries like Joyce Meyer Ministries. The Statement of Faith on her web site reveals some basic Christian teachings, but also includes decision theology, emphasis on charismatic gifts like spiritual healing and a prosperity gospel that is placed in the context of helping others. Elsewhere on her web site she speaks of God communicating with her apart from the Bible.\nErrors like these call for the implementation of biblical instructions like Romans 16:17 and 2 John 9-11."}

{"prompt": "Differences between WELS and CLC", "completion": "In my area there are many Lutheran churches, including a WELS church and a CLC (Church of the Lutheran Confession) church? What are the differences between these two branches of conservative Lutheranism?\n\n\nThe differences have largely been in the area of applying biblical fellowship principles. The Church of the Lutheran Confession (CLC) was founded in 1960 by congregations and pastors who left the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) and the Evangelical Lutheran Synod (ELS) because they maintained WELS and ELS did not break fellowship with the Lutheran Church\u2014Missouri Synod (LCMS) quickly enough.\nIt is encouraging to report that representatives from the CLC, WELS and ELS have recently been participating in formal doctrinal discussions. The following information is from a December 2015 Together newsletter (WELS):\n\u201cRepresentatives from the Church of the Lutheran Confession, the Evangelical Lutheran Synod, and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod met in Waukesha, Wis., on Nov. 13 to continue formal doctrinal discussions. The group made final edits to a joint statement on the biblical doctrine of fellowship. This statement had been adopted as a draft by the group in an earlier meeting and had been shared with the doctrinal committees of all three synods. Comments from those committees were considered in the writing of the latest draft. The revised statement will be shared again with the doctrinal committees for additional input.\n\u201cThe group also spent a portion of the meeting addressing how the biblical doctrine of fellowship is applied in various situations. One significant area of discussion is how the biblical fellowship principles impact participation in various organizations that may have religious elements in their governing documents or in how the organizations function. Another subject for discussion was the biblical doctrine of the role of men and women in the church, in marriage, and in society. Discussion of these matters will continue at the next meeting, planned for early in 2016.\n\u201cThe talks have been constructive and positive, with all involved fully committed to a faithful understanding and application of God\u2019s Word.\u201d\nIt is the prayer of many that God continue to bless these efforts to restore doctrinal fellowship."}
{"prompt": "Possible to fall from faith?", "completion": "I have heard that Lutherans believe it is possible for a believer to fall from faith and the WELS web site has confirmed this (This We Believe IV. Justification #9). However, I have also heard that Lutheran doctrine teaches that Christ gives assurance of salvation in a way that implies some sort of \"once saved, always saved\" doctrine. Is this true and if so, how does it not contradict the belief that a Christian can fall? Also, does the belief that we are saved by baptism or by election mean that there is more than one way to be saved?\r\n\n\n\nIt is clear from Scripture that people can fall from faith (Luke 8:13; 1 Corinthians 10:12; Galatians 5:4; 1 Timothy 1:19-20; 2 Peter 3:17).\nWhile God\u2019s law warns us about falling away from faith, God\u2019s gospel assures us that we are safe and secure in God\u2019s hands (John 10:28-29). While we definitely pay attention to the warnings of the law, we cling all the more in Spirit-worked faith to the gospel of Jesus Christ. The gospel is \u201cthe power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes\u201d (Romans 1:16). The gospel is God\u2019s message of eternal life (John 3:16).\nIf God has elected a person to salvation, God will bring that individual to saving faith and preserve that individual in saving faith. None of the elect are lost; all the elect enjoy eternal life. In figurative language Revelation 7 describes all the elect on this earth, and Revelation 14 describes all the elect in God\u2019s presence in heaven.\nIf a person at one point in life professed Christian faith but then distanced himself or herself from God and died without saving faith, that person was not among the elect.\nThere is only way to be saved: that is through faith in Jesus Christ (Acts 4:12; 17:31). God works saving faith through the gospel (Romans 1:16). God can work saving faith through the gospel in word alone or through the word and water\u2014baptism. Because baptism connects people to Jesus Christ in saving faith, Scripture can rightly say that baptism saves (Titus 3:5; 1 Peter 3:21). When people are brought to saving faith in Jesus and leave this world with saving faith in their hearts, God was responsible for that through his gracious election (2 Timothy 1:9)."}
{"prompt": "Life beyond planet earth?", "completion": "Does the Bible preclude life on another planet? With the vastness of space, we often hear of other planets that could be capable of sustaining life. Genesis details the creation of earth, but doesn't mention the possibility of life elsewhere. Can we read from its silence that there could be no life elsewhere, or could life beyond earth be possible, according to Scripture?\r\nThank you.\n\n\nThe only extraterrestrial life of which the Bible speaks is that of the angels. Scripture throughout speaks of God\u2019s interaction\u2014especially his saving activity\u2014with people on this earth (John 3:16). Similarly, Jesus spoke of the need to take his gospel message to \u201call the world\u201d (Mark 16:15).\nGod\u2019s record of creation in Genesis 1 and 2 describes a vast universe, with people on earth as the crown of his creation. There is nothing in the Bible that suggests the possibility of life elsewhere."}
{"prompt": "Figures of speech and the Lord's Supper", "completion": "I am home schooling my son and we were watching a video on similes and metaphors.  While a simile uses words like \"is like\" or \"as\" such as \"Joe is like a  horse\" or \"Joe is as strong as a horse,\" a metaphor uses the word \"is\" such as \"Joe is a horse.\" The first thing that came to my mind was the bread: This \"is\" my body, and the wine:  This \"is\" my blood. And immediately my faith was shaken. Can you help me?  \r\n\n\n\nDuring his ministry Jesus certainly used figures of speech such as similes (Luke 17:24), metaphors (Luke 13:32) and parables (Luke 13:18-21).\nWhen it comes to Jesus\u2019 words of institution, understanding the context will determine how to interpret the meaning of his words. There is nothing in the immediate context that tells us to understand his words in a figurative way. He is speaking words meant to be taken literally.\nThe wider context of the Bible confirms this. In 1 Corinthians 10:16 the apostle Paul, by inspiration of the Holy Spirit, asks: \u201cIs not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ?\u201d His questions anticipate and expect the answer \u201cyes.\u201d So, yes, there is a participation, a communion, between the cup of thanksgiving\u2014the wine\u2014and the blood of Christ, and there is a participation between the bread and the body of Christ. Jesus\u2019 body and blood are present in, with and under the bread and wine in the sacrament.\nIn the next chapter of that same letter, the apostle speaks of the real presence of Jesus\u2019 body and blood in the sacrament when he writes: \u201cSo then, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord\u201d (1 Corinthians 11:27). That verse highlights very clearly the four items present in the sacrament: the bread and wine, and Jesus\u2019 body and blood.\nThere is no reason for your faith to be shaken. In fact, it is quite the opposite. Through his holy supper your Lord comes to you to strengthen your faith and to offer and give you forgiveness of sins. So be a guest at his supper often! Take to heart not only the words \u201cThis is my body\u2026this is my blood\u201d but also the words \u201cfor you\u201d (Luke 22:19, 20). In the sacrament Jesus is giving you his body and blood to forgive your sins and deepen your trust that you are redeemed child of God."}
{"prompt": "Take classes before baptism?", "completion": "Does the WELS make a new Christian take classes before they are baptized? If so, why? \n\n\nFollowing biblical examples (Acts 8:26-40; 16:16-34), it is the normal practice in our congregations to instruct adults before baptizing them. (I would avoid the terminology that we \u201cmake them\u201d take classes.) The amount of instruction varies from congregation to congregation.\nWhy instruct? Through baptism adults become members of the local congregation. Instruction provides biblical explanation of what baptism is and offers, and that instruction explains the public confession of the congregation to which baptism connects that person.\nWe recognize that God brings people to saving faith through the gospel (Romans 1:16), whether that is the gospel in word alone, or water and the word (baptism). In the case of an adult whom God has brought to faith through the word alone, that person would seek baptism\u2014to do what Jesus says and to receive, in addition to the message of the Bible, another guarantee of God\u2019s love and forgiveness in Christ."}
{"prompt": "Jesus' death and his descent into hell", "completion": "In Luke 23:43 Jesus says, \"Today you will be with me in paradise.\" In our creeds, however, we say, \"He descended into hell.\" I am certain the the Bible is true, and I am not trying to sound like a skeptic, but could you explain where Jesus went after dying and how these two statements are compatible?\n\n\nOn the cross, Jesus told the repentant thief: \u201cTruly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise\u201d (Luke 23:43). At death, the body and soul separate. When Jesus died on Good Friday, his body and soul separated, as did the body and soul of the repentant thief. Their bodies remained on earth, while their souls entered paradise, heaven. Recall that just prior to his death, Jesus cried out: \u201cFather, into your hands I commit my spirit\u201d (Luke 23:46).\nWhile the body of the repentant thief remains in some form on the earth and his soul is in heaven, Jesus\u2019 body (which did not decay\u2014Acts 2:31) and soul were reunited \u201con the third day,\u201d just as Jesus had said numerous times (e.g., Matthew 16:21; 17:23).\nBefore Jesus appeared to people on earth on Easter Sunday morning, he descended into hell with his body and soul to proclaim his victory over sin, Satan and death (1 Peter 3:18-20)."}

What are Apostolic Lutherans and what do they believe?\n\n\nThe web site of the Apostolic Lutheran Church of America provides this information:\n\u201cThe Apostolic Lutheran Church was organized in the United States in 1872, having its roots with a group of people who came from Finland, Sweden, and Norway in the 1860\u2019s. The Apostolic Lutheran Church of America has 55 churches with about 9,000 members.\n\u201cApostolic Lutheranism, as a whole, has been and still is mostly a lay movement with ministerial training not a pre-requisite for ordination to the ministry. Evidence of a \u201ccall by God to preach the Word\u201d is the main criteria for ordination of the clergy and elders. The church buildings in which members worship are very simple in structure and beauty. The worship service consists of a simple liturgy. A typical worship service includes an opening hymn, prayer, a hymn and free will offering, a sermon from the Bible, communion, and a closing hymn and benediction.\n\u201cThe Apostolic Lutheran Church of America recognizes as true, the Christian Doctrine, based on the Old and New Testaments of the Holy Bible, the Lutheran Doctrine, and the Book of Concord, and the three ecumenical symbols: the Apostolic, the Nicene, the Athanasian [Creeds, as well as the], and the Augsburg Confessions, (those parts) which are in agreement with the Holy Bible and uphold the Confession of True Faith, and love as the greatest law.\n\u201cAll ritual and polity of the Church are to be governed according to the immovable truths of the above mentioned Confessions, namely, that the Holy Word of God (both the Old and New Testaments) shall be the sole authority of truth in the light of which all doctrine in this Church shall be examined and determined.\n\u201cThe principal calling (duty) of this Church shall be the propagation of the true doctrine, which shall manifest itself in the preaching of repentance and the remission (forgiveness) of sins, and by the administration of the sacraments of Holy Baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper customarily practiced by the Apostolic Lutheran Churches. The Apostolic Lutheran Church emphasizes the importance of a personal experience of justification by faith (salvation experience).

{"prompt": "1 Corinthians 11:29 and the Lord's Supper", "completion": "In 1 Corinthians 11:29 (AKJV) we read, \"For he that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.\" According to this verse taking communion improperly is a sin against Jesus' body. With this verse in mind, can a member of a church who improperly administers Communion, like a church that denies the Real Presence, go to heaven when they are eating and drinking damnation to themselves?\n\n\nAnswering your question means understanding the \u201cdamnation\u201d (in the translation you cited) brought about by unworthily receiving the Lord\u2019s Supper.\nThe Greek word in 1 Corinthians 11:29 means \u201cjudgment\u201d or \u201ccondemnation.\u201d \u201cDamnation\u201d speaks of an everlasting judgment that is irreversible. The immediate context (1 Corinthians 11:30) speaks of temporal judgments, and not damnation, that some Christians in Corinth received for their unworthily reception of the Lord\u2019s Supper.\nCould such temporal judgments lead to an everlasting judgment of condemnation or damnation? Certainly, that is the serious nature of impenitence and unbelief. However, Bible translations that speak of \u201ccondemnation\u201d and not \u201cdamnation\u201d in 1 Corinthians 11:29 hit the mark in light of the immediate context.\nThis does not minimize the seriousness of those who fail to \u201cdiscern the body of Christ\u201d (1 Corinthians 11:29). All doctrinal errors are serious and potentially faith destroying. Without question, the apostle Paul\u2019s prayer that his readers would grow in knowledge and faith (Ephesians 1:17-19) is our prayer for people who do not profess the truths of Scripture."}

Certainly. That is the essence of the Christian cross\u2014suffering for the Christian faith. But Jesus said, \u201cDo not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul.

{"prompt": "The real presence in the Lord's Supper", "completion": "The Augsburg Confession, Article10, states that Lutherans believe in the real presence. How do the body and blood of Christ become present in the Eucharist according to WELS Lutherans? Do you believe that the Eucharist of other Lutheran denominations (such as LCMS) is validly consecrated? What about other denominations who believe in the Real Presence like Anglicans?\n\n\nThis We Believe, a statement of belief of the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod, states: \u201cWe believe that all who join in the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper receive the true body and blood of Christ in, with, and under the bread and wine (1 Corinthians 10:16). This is true because, when the Lord instituted this sacrament, he said, \u2018This is my body. This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins\u2019 (Matthew 26:26,28). We believe that Christ\u2019s words of institution cause the real presence\u2014not any human action.\n\u201cWe reject any attempt to set the precise moment within the celebration of the Lord\u2019s Supper when the body and blood of Christ become present. We therefore reject the view that one must believe that Christ\u2019s body and blood are present as soon as the words of consecration have been spoken and the view that one must believe that Christ\u2019s body and blood become present only at the moment of eating and drinking.\u201d\nThe Lutheran Confessions address this subject in more detail in Article VII of the Formula of Concord.\nThere is a valid consecration in other Lutheran churches, since they use the word of God by which Jesus instituted the sacrament and the earthly elements designated by the Lord.\nWhile using the Lord\u2019s words and the earthly elements designated by the Lord, the Church of England teaches that only believers receive the body and blood of the Lord, and they receive that only by faith. While that is the official teaching, the wording of the Holy Eucharist liturgy in The Book of Common Prayer has been purposely ambiguous over the years to accommodate a wide variety of belief: real presence, representation and transubstantiation. The intent to create a \u201cbig tent\u201d for diversity of beliefs\u2014in regard to the Lord\u2019s Supper and other doctrinal matters\u2014finds its origin in the Elizabethan Settlement of 1559."}

So paradise is a place where the souls waited for Jesus to get them when he went to heaven.\r\nShe told me there are three heavens and paradise is one of the three heavens. This is a little beyond my knowledge. I need some help to explain this one. Thank you.\n\n\nThe first half of John chapter three tells us about a conversation between a Pharisee named Nicodemus and Jesus. In his part of the conversation Nicodemus demonstrated a woeful ignorance of the converting work of the Holy Spirit.\nIn verse eleven Jesus described what often happened during his ministry when he taught people the truths of God\u2019s word: people stumbled over his words in unbelief and rejected them. In verse twelve Jesus inquired as to how Nicodemus was going to believe the \u201cheavenly things\u201d Jesus might discuss, since Nicodemus had not believed the \u201cearthly things\u201d of which the Lord had spoken. Then follows the verse you cited.\nWith the context of the preceding verses, it is clear that in verse thirteen Jesus is saying that he alone has firsthand knowledge of \u201cheavenly things.\u201d Other teachers of the word of God, like Nicodemus, do not have that firsthand knowledge. Jesus came from heaven to this earth as a little child to teach people the will of God and to fulfill all the prophecies of the Messiah. He alone can speak truthfully of \u201cheavenly things.\u201d No other person \u201chas ever gone into heaven\u201d (John 3:13) in the way, and with the authority, that Jesus \u201ccame from heaven\u201d (John 3:13).\nWhen we keep verse thirteen in its context, we will see the verse speaking of Jesus as an authoritative teacher and not the barring of heaven\u2019s gate until Jesus\u2019 death.\nIn 2 Corinthians 12 the apostle Paul does speak of being \u201ccaught up to the third heaven\u201d (2 Corinthians 12:2), to \u201cparadise\u201d (2 Corinthians 12:4). This was an experience that baffled even the apostle. He wrote: \u201cWhether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know\u2014God knows (2 Corinthians 12:2). \u201cThe third heaven\u201d and \u201cparadise\u201d are synonymous with \u201cheaven.\u201d The adjective \u201cthird\u201d can denote the glory of heaven, or it can reference the place where God reveals himself in all his glory (with the \u201cfirst\u201d heaven being the sky and the \u201csecond\u201d heaven being the farther regions of the sun, moon and stars). While this particular biblical reference to heaven challenges our understanding, the Bible consistently speaks of one heaven and one hell. Of utmost importance is knowing how one enters heaven and avoids hell. That is through God-given faith in Jesus Christ, the Messiah, the Son of God."}
{"prompt": "Jesus' words to the repentant thief", "completion": "My neighbor says when people die they do not go to heaven or hell at that time, only when Jesus comes back. I was taught that their souls went to heaven or hell right away and when Jesus returns the body and soul will be reunited. I used the thief on the cross and Jesus' answer:  today you will be with me in paradise.  She said in the Greek there is no comma after today, so he didn't mean it to be right now. How do I answer her?\n\n\nScripture teaches that the body and soul separate at death, and people face immediate judgment (Ecclesiastes 12:7; Luke 16:22-23; 23:43; Hebrews 9:27).\nThe way to arrive at the intended meaning of Jesus\u2019 words to the repentant thief is to keep his words in the context of the conversation. The thief asked that Jesus remember him. He made that request with an element of time included: \u201cwhen you come into your kingdom.\u201d The thief\u2019s words looked to the future. Jesus acknowledged the man\u2019s request and graciously granted it. Jesus did so also with an element of time included: \u201ctoday.\u201d While the thief, in faith, sought Jesus\u2019 remembrance of him at some time in the future, Jesus assured the man that his soul would be with his Savior \u201ctoday,\u201d when both of them died.\nYour neighbor is correct that the inspired writers did not use punctuation marks like commas. We insert them in our translations according to the rules of our grammar. In Luke 23:43 we insert a comma between the two clauses that constitute the sentence. To place a comma after \u201ctoday,\u201d has no basis whatsoever. Jesus was certainly speaking those words \u201ctoday\u201d and not \u201cyesterday\u201d or \u201ctomorrow.\u201d The comma belongs before the word \u201ctoday\u201d because that fits with the context of Jesus\u2019 words."}

{"prompt": "Seventh-Day Adventists and legalism", "completion": "I get into a lot of discussions with a Seventh-Day Adventist. One such discussion was that he believes eating processed foods is a sin. I believe that is legalism. The only dietary mandate for the New Testament Christian is \"everything in moderation.\" If a person puts themselves in a position where eating too many processed foods is harming them, then it could be a sin, yes. Otherwise, processed foods are neutral and something to be eaten with thanks. Is this correct? He insisted that only \"natural\" foods are worthy of thanks. \"Unnatural\" foods are not gifts from God. I took the approach that \"the earth and all that is within it is the Lord's.\"\r\n\r\nIn an effort to make my point to him about legalism, I brought up the subject of marijuana. If marijuana was legal, would a Christian be sinning by using it in \"moderation?\" Since there is no biblical mandate on marijuana, I said it could be possible. That really angered the Seventh-Day Adventist because Ellen G. White has made statements on drugs, which they have to take as God's word on the subject, because they elevate her writings to Scripture in some cases.\r\n\r\nOf course, it is a moot point. Marijuana use is a sin because it is illegal, and that puts it under the category of obeying the government. Nevertheless, am I correct in my attempts to not get mired in legalism in my discussions with this Seventh-Day Adventist? We do not have the authority to make things sin that God has not called sin.\n\n\nYou are correct in saying that \u201cwe do not have the authority to make things sin that God has not called sin.\u201d Seventh-Day Adventists have a history of taking \u201cindifferent matters,\u201d including items of food and drink that God has neither commanded nor forbidden in his word and putting them on a \u201cforbidden list.\u201d Their web site lists such items. The book of Galatians is a wonderful exposition and application of Christian freedom. Do share that book with your friend.\nWhile some 23 states have legalized medicinal marijuana usage and four other states have legalized \u201crecreational\u201d marijuana usage, the substance remains illegal elsewhere in our country. Where it is illegal, it is a matter of obeying the government, as you noted. Where it has been legalized, Christians will recognize that government legislation does not necessarily or automatically make something God pleasing. Consider the legalization of abortion, no-fault divorce and same-sex marriage.\nThoughts of using that legalized substance need to be balanced by asking: If something is permissible, is it beneficial? (1 Corinthians 10:23) Is an activity beneficial for me\u2014and others? The 1 Corinthians 10:23 passage occurs in the context of exercising our Christian freedom with an eye on how our actions might impact others\u2014especially emboldening them to act against their conscience, and so to sin against their conscience. Would usage lead a person to dull his/her senses and lose self-control? (Proverbs 31:4-5; Luke 21:34; Romans 13:13; Galatians 5:21; Ephesians 5:18) The Bible tells us to \u201cBe alert and of sober mind\u201d (1 Peter 5:8). Would usage lead to addiction? The first time the phrase \u201ceverything is permissible for me\u201d occurs in 1 Corinthians is in chapter 6. There (verse 12) Paul explains that we will not want to \u201cbe mastered by anything.\u201d Might a person act in doubt and thus sin? (Romans 14:23) Will a person be harming the body that God created and which belongs to him? (This is a 5th commandment issue.) Questions like these urge extreme caution in a specific area of which the Bible is silent.\nFinally, you are correct in that you do not want to \u201cget mired in legalism\u201d in your discussions with your friend. To a person who belongs to a church which officially teaches work righteousness, point your friend to Jesus Christ as Savior\u2014complete Savior, perfect Savior. Show your friend from Scripture that salvation is entirely God\u2019s work not ours (Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:5-7). God bless your discussions!"}
{"prompt": "Red Letter Christians", "completion": "What can you tell me about the Red Letter Christians?  \n\n\nOn its web site the organization describes itself as espousing \u201can evangelical theology.\u201d \u201cEvangelical\u201d is a broad term that individuals and churches use to mean different things. It often designates a theology that professes a set of doctrines, including decision theology and a rejection of the sacraments as means of grace, but then \u201cagrees to disagree\u201d in other matters of Scripture.\nThe goal of Red Letter Christians is: \u201cTo take Jesus seriously by endeavoring to live out His radical, counter-cultural teachings as set forth in Scripture, and especially embracing the lifestyle prescribed in the Sermon on the Mount.\u201d\nWhile that sounds laudable, the result is a liberal theology that addresses social issues in ways that depart from Scripture. The organization would do well to apply the red letter words of Jesus in the sermon on the mount in a manner consistent with the rest of Scripture and then put greater emphasis on other red letter words of Jesus\u2014words that speak of the enslaving nature of sin (John 8:24) and words that speak of full and free forgiveness through him (Luke 7:48)."}
{"prompt": "A Christian and career decisions", "completion": "Hello. I am considering a career in either marketing or graphic design. Can a Christian consider an occupation in those areas?  \r\nIt seems like modern-day marketing (specifically advertising) portrays many sinful things contrary to God's Word. Many current ads are not afraid to portray sin in them. They could show people being covetous for their product. They could show men or women in scantily clad clothing trying to make the consumer lust. They could show a homosexual couple with the intent of making that acceptable. Or it might show people being discontent, rude, or hateful towards a competitor's product. Therefore, could a Christian be a marketer if they would have to create advertisements that portray sin in them?  \r\nAs for graphic design, you can't decide the content that you can show. Yet, the graphic designer would still try to design material for the company to try to promote that product in the best way they can to try to make the consumer buy the product by any means necessary. So, would the graphic designer be trying to make the consumer covet the product or could he do his job without trying to do this?\r\nOr is all of this simply a matter of trying to do your job by adhering to what it says in God's Word? Are we simply to try to do any job (that isn't intentionally sinful) to the best of our ability to the glory of God without trying to sin and/or trying to make others sin?\r\nSo what is the Christian to do? I think about passages like Matthew 18:6-7 and 1 Corinthians 10:23. Or is this simply a matter of what Romans 14 says? A broader question is what jobs could a Christian consider doing?\r\nThank you for your time. God bless.\n\n\nThe numerous questions I read appear to come from a very conscientious approach to life. For that I commend you. At the same time, I am interested in tempering your concerns with a realistic view of what we call Christian vocation.\nBecause it becomes impractical in this forum to respond to each of your questions, I am thinking the best way to provide help is to steer you to reading material that addresses Christian vocation. This link will take you to a short paper on the topic. This link takes you to a Bible study written by the same author. Perhaps your pastor or congregation already has that Bible study. These materials will make clear how it is, and why it is, that we serve God with our lives.\nI can assure you that you do not have to shy away from your fields of interest\u2014marketing or graphic design\u2014because of built-in, universal conflicts to the Christian faith. There could be projects that challenge you, but the industry itself is not off-limits for Christians. Who knows? You could even be involved in the marketing or ad design of a new prescription drug that serves as a great benefit to people!\nI began by commending your conscientious approach to life. Certainly, we do not want to act against our conscience or God\u2019s word. At the same time, we want to recognize the freedoms God has given us\u2014even in the ways in which we can serve him and others. God bless your reading of those materials and your subsequent vocational plans."}
{"prompt": "Any churches close to where we might move?", "completion": "My husband & I are considering moving to Blaine, Washington but there are no WELS or ELS churches nearby. As a lifelong WELS member I'm very nervous about living somewhere where I cannot attend a church that will support my faith. What would you recommend?\n\n\nWidening the search radius on the WELS Locator to 50 miles reveals that there is an ELS congregation (St. Luke\u2019s Lutheran Church) in Mt. Vernon, Washington. The church is 45 miles south of Blaine and it looks like mostly interstate driving.\nIf the distance appears to be impractical, you might want to contact the pastor of St. Luke\u2019s to see if there are other WELS/ELS members in Blaine who might be served in some way or serve as the nucleus for a new mission start.\nIn addition, if you look north, WELS-Canada has a church in Vancouver, British Columbia: Savior of the Nations Lutheran Church. That appears to be about 30 miles from Blaine.\nIf you live in the Midwest and are fairly close to your current congregation, these may seem like great distances to drive to church. I can assure you that there are people, outside the Midwest, who do travel distances like these\u2014and greater\u2014to their churches.\nYou certainly have wonderful priorities and the right concern in contemplating a move.

{"prompt": "Participate in paganism blessings ritual?", "completion": "Our daughter has left the church to practice various forms of paganism.  She is getting married this fall and wants us to attend.  I told her we could attend and acknowledge that she and her new husband love each other.  She wants us to participate in a \"blessings\" ritual. Each person is invited to give the couple some sort of blessing.  I asked if we could offer God's blessing and she agreed.  Now I have no idea how to ask God to bless this sort of thing.  Are we even right to attend?  I am heartbroken over the whole thing\r\n\n\n\nI am saddened to hear about your daughter\u2019s departure from your church. God willing, through your Christian witness she can be reminded of biblical truths and then embrace them again and profess them through membership in a church like ours that proclaims Jesus Christ as Savior.\nCan you attend the blessings ritual? It seems like you answered your own question. You can attend and support your daughter, unless your conscience is telling you that you would be doing wrong. Scripture warns us about acting in doubt and against our conscience (Romans 14:23).\nIf you attend the blessings ritual, can you participate? God tells us in his word not to participate in events like that (Romans 16:17; 2 Corinthians 6:14-16). You could explain to your daughter that you will be happy to ask God, in prayer, to bless her marriage, but not in the setting of a blessings ritual of paganism. You could ask her to respect your wishes.\nYou are in a challenging situation. What can help direct your actions is trying to determine how you can most lovingly and most clearly testify to others about the truths of Scripture: that Jesus Christ is Savior and there is no salvation outside him (John 14:6); that God\u2019s word is true (John 17:17); and, that followers of Jesus hold to all of his teachings (John 8:31). I would have to ask myself if taking part in a ritual blessing with pagans (as I understand it from your question) would be a clear testimony to the truths of God\u2019s word, or would such action be misunderstood to mean that everyone participating in the ritual blessing is imparting legitimate truth of some kind? I would not want to be sending that message.\nYou may wish to consult your pastor about this. I will pray for God\u2019s blessings on you and your family."}
{"prompt": "Apostles today?", "completion": "Are there apostles today?\n\n\nLiterally, apostle means \u201csent out,\u201d \u201cone who is sent out.\u201d With that idea in mind, we reserve the title of apostle for those men who personally saw the Lord and were commissioned by him to do his work. So, no, there are no apostles today.\nThen, again, there is one Apostle today. The writer to the Hebrews encourages his readers: \u201cTherefore, holy brothers and sisters, who share in the heavenly calling, fix your thoughts on Jesus, whom we acknowledge as our apostle and high priest\u201d (3:1). Jesus is an apostle in that his heavenly Father sent him to this world on a search and rescue mission: seeking and rescuing lost sinners. For that, we are eternally grateful!"}
{"prompt": "Using pre-service time to prepare for worship", "completion": "Paul rebuked the Corinthian congregation when its lax practices hindered a worshipful attitude. He instructed the members to eat and drink at home in order to quell the unruly nature of their gatherings. In these modern times, must we instead do our preparing for worship and/or the Lord\u2019s Supper at home because the atmosphere in the sanctuary is full of robust conversations and laughter? The organist has prepared pre-service music complementing the readings and hymns, but if someone wishes to listen and pray and prepare, he is hindered by the non-worshipful atmosphere all around him. I understand that our congregations are a type of family reunion gathering. But isn\u2019t there a proper place and time for the loud chatter outside the pre-service period?\n\n\nYou have proper concern for wanting an atmosphere before the worship service that is conducive for contemplation, meditation and preparation.  \nA common practice of churches is that hushed conversations among worshipers end with the beginning of pre-service music.  I would encourage you to forward your concern to your pastor and the congregation\u2019s board of elders."}
{"prompt": "Purpose of Luther's Catechism", "completion": "Hi. I understand that the WELS teaches from the Bible and regards the Bible as the true Word of God. However, I am confused about the Catechism and Martin Luther. Is the Catechism an explanation of doctrines in the Bible or is it teachings of Luther? Thank you. \n\n\nElsewhere on this web site you can read that \u201cMartin Luther wrote the Small Catechism as a brief summary of the basic truths of the Christian faith. It was primarily intended to educate the laity and was designed as a tool that parents could use to teach their children. It provides summaries or explanations of the Ten Commandments, the Apostles Creed, the Lord\u2019s Prayer, the Sacrament of Baptism, the Sacrament of the Altar (Holy Communion), and the Ministry of the Keys and Confession.\u201d\nLuther also wrote the Large Catechism. \u201cCovering in greater depth the same doctrines and subjects as the Small Catechism, the Large Catechism was really a series of edited sermons of Martin Luther. It was intended primarily as a tool that could be used by pastors and teachers to broaden their knowledge of the teachings of the Bible.\u201d\nThe Catechisms provide an explanation of biblical teachings. Scripture alone is the source of our faith (Ephesians 2:20)."}
{"prompt": "WELS and Bible translations", "completion": "Why does the WELS use a Bible that is based on the Catholic Alexandrian manuscripts instead of the KJV?\n\n\nAllow me to address a couple of misconceptions in the question.\nWELS does not have and has not had an official Bible translation. Congregations are free to use the translation of their choosing. The recent discussions in our church body over Bible translations have dealt with which translation to use in our publications. The current approach is an \u201ceclectic\u201d one, meaning that publications might use a particular translation based on the preference of the author or editor.\nWhen it comes to Bible translations, you will want to keep in mind that the King James Version (1611 A.D.) was based on about 100 manuscripts of the New Testament that dated from approximately 900 to 1500 A.D. In the past century or so, numerous manuscripts have been discovered that date back to 200 to 500 A.D. This means that more recent Bible translations will utilize the manuscripts that were available to the translators of the King James Version and the earlier manuscripts."}
{"prompt": "Heaven and marriage", "completion": "My wife of 24 years passed away from cancer. When I go to heaven, will I still be married to her? Will I recognize her as my wife and what we had on earth? \n\n\nFirst, let me express my sympathy to you and remind you that those who die in the Lord are blessed by being in the Lord\u2019s presence (Revelation 14:13). Christians enjoy that blessing of eternal life because Jesus conquered death (1 Corinthians 15:54-57).\nThe Bible does teach very clearly that marriage is an earthly institution only (Matthew 22:23-33). There is no marriage between individuals in heaven. The only marriage in heaven is that between the Church and Jesus Christ (Revelation 21:1-4).\nThere is little information in the Bible on our recognition of others in heaven. Many point to the account of Jesus\u2019 transfiguration where Peter knew who Moses and Elijah were, even though he had never met them before in person (Matthew 17:4; Mark 9:5; Luke 9:33). They take that to mean that we too will know who other Christians in heaven are and how we might have interacted with them during our earthly lives. Others point to 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 where Paul comforted the Christians in Thessalonica with the assurance that they would see Christians who had died in the past and be with them together forever.\nThe biblical truth is that Christians will be with the Lord forever. While we may have questions now about that wonderful, perfect life, we will find out for sure one day (1 John 3:2). May Jesus\u2019 victory over death and his promises of sharing in that victory (John 11:25-26) always be your comfort and strength!"}
{"prompt": "How to answer a test question", "completion": "I have to answer a question on a teacher's exam asking \"When did the earliest humans enter Wisconsin?\" According to the WI Website, it says \"the first known inhabitants of what is now Wisconsin were called Paleo-Indians, who first arrived in the region in about 10,000 BC.\" Of course, we don't believe that the earth is that old. How can I answer according to our Christian beliefs?\n\n\nIf one goes by the genealogies in the Bible, as Archbishop Ussher did, there is a world history of approximately 6,000 years. Recognizing that the biblical genealogies are not complete, it becomes realistic to add some time to that total. It is not uncommon to read of conservative theologians speaking of creation having taken place within the last 6,000 to 10,000 years. So, the date that you provided is not striking. However, many anthropologists and archaeologists speak of Paleo-Indians within the context of a time frame of the human race that far exceeds what is suggested by the Bible.\nChristian test-takers in a secular environment who want to pass exams and not compromise their faith do face a dilemma. One person who was in that situation years ago told me how she handled it. Because it was an open-ended question, there was space to write: \u201cI know you\u2019re looking for this answer\u201d [and then she listed it], \u201cbut this is what I believe.\u201d God guide you in your response."}
{"prompt": "Applying biblical fellowship principles", "completion": "I ring handbells for a secular community choir and have recently faced difficulties with church fellowship. Many of the ringers are from non-WELS congregations and when their church choir needs a substitute, they often ask us for assistance. Am I correct in saying that acting as a substitute ringer for worship (or performing as part of a small ensemble) at a non-WELS congregation would go against fellowship principles in this case? What about substituting for rehearsals but not worship? And finally, what about playing for a non-WELS wedding at the request of a friend?\r\n\r\nI suspect that the answer for most, if not all, is that it does indeed go against our fellowship principles, but it would help set my heart at ease to be sure of my doctrinal grounds for refusing to participate.\n\n\nYou have a correct understanding of biblical fellowship principles. It is one thing to participate in a musical group (of singers or instrumentalists) in performance or concert settings and quite another matter for a group to pool their talents in worship service settings. In the latter, doctrinal agreement among the participants is necessary (Romans 16:17; 2 John 10, 11).\nWhen you are not able to participate with other musicians in worship service settings, you have an opportunity to explain biblical fellowship principles to others. God bless the testimony you give with your words and actions!"}
{"prompt": "Questions about the Bible", "completion": "I'm an older man and I've been Lutheran all of my life, so you can imagine how many times I've heard the \"God is love\" sermon. It just seems as though the older I get the more difficult it is for me to believe much of what I've been taught over the last 70 years.\r\nAs an example. We're told that the devil is a fallen angel and that God is the creator of all things. He knows when a bird falls from the sky, knows the number of hairs on our heads, and hears all of our individual prayers. Why then would he subject those he loves to hardships supposedly caused by a single evil entity?\r\nHow about identifying the reason for Jesus? We don't need a Savior, we have God.  He knows our faults and if we  honestly are sorry for what we've done wrong. \r\nWhat about the \"flood?\"  Are we to believe that when God killed every man, woman and child, that they were all vile sinners and there wasn't a good soul among them?\r\nWe are told that the prophecy of a Savior had been told for hundreds of years, that a star would show the way. Why then did that star only show the way to the three wise men, who were the richest men in town?\n\n\nI am sorry to hear about your struggles in clinging to the truths of Scripture that you have heard and believed for so long. We do know from the Bible that the devil wants to snatch God\u2019s word from our hearts and lives (Luke 8:5, 12). In addition, our sinful nature (Romans 8:7) and the unbelieving world (1 John 2:15) are opposed to God and his word. This means that we need to build up the new self within us through regular use of God\u2019s gospel in word and sacrament.\nNow, to your specific questions.\nGod does not explain to us in the Bible why he allowed sin to enter his perfect creation. What he does explain is what he did when sin threatened to plunge all people into eternal death: he gave of himself that we could have life and forgiveness through his Son (1 John 4:9-10).\nGod\u2019s Son, Jesus, is upfront with us when it comes to troubles in life. What he first told his little band of followers holds true for you and me: \u201cIn this world you will have trouble.\u201d But more than simply opening our eyes to the reality of life\u2019s difficulties, Jesus promised: \u201cBut take heart! I have overcome the world\u201d (John 16:33) And of course in God\u2019s wisdom and love, hardships in life are signs of his love for his children (Hebrews 12:7-13).\nThe reason for Jesus? Certainly God knows our faults and if we are sorry for the wrongs we have done. But neither God\u2019s knowledge nor our confessions of wrongdoing remove sin from our lives. God determined that \u201cwithout the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness\u201d (Hebrews 9:22). That was the message of the animal sacrifices in the Old Testament\u2014all of which pointed to Jesus and the shedding of his blood on the cross that \u201cpurifies us from all sin\u201d (1 John 1:7).\nThrough the flood of Noah\u2019s day, God did destroy the godless, impenitent and unbelieving world. Noah is described as \u201ca righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked faithfully with God\u201d (Genesis 6:9). Noah was not without sin (we see that in Genesis 9), but Noah and his family had penitent, faith-filled hearts through God\u2019s working in them.\nWe don\u2019t know how many Magi, wise men, there were. People often think in terms of three men because three gifts are mentioned (Matthew 2:11), but we do not know the number. Were they the richest men in town? We don\u2019t know that either. They were definitely spiritually rich because they knew and believed that the Savior born in Bethlehem was also their Savior. That is the great truth of the account of the Magi visiting and worshiping Jesus: Jesus came into the world to be the Savior of all people, including Gentiles, including you and me.\nI encourage you to speak to your pastor if you have doubts and questions about the faith. He will be happy to address them, and pray with and for you. In addition, continue to use God\u2019s gospel in word and sacrament faithfully and regularly. That is the means God uses to strengthen your faith. God bless you."}

Therefore, could a believer in Jesus as their Savior from sin go to hell if that person intentionally does or lives in at least one sin the rest of their life until death?\n\n\nIn the sermon on the mount Jesus taught: \u201cNot everyone who says to me, \u2018Lord, Lord,\u2019 will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven\u201d (Matthew 7:21). God\u2019s will is that people repent of their sins and trust in Jesus Christ as their Savior through the power of the Holy Spirit (Mark 1:15).\nPassages that you cited, especially 1 Corinthians 6:9-11, teach that impenitence over sin\u2014not any one particular sin\u2014bars people from the kingdom of God. An outward profession of faith in Christ, accompanied by willful sin and an impenitent attitude, is not a description of saving faith. The words of Christ from the sermon on the mount previously cited can be applied to people who lull themselves into spiritual apathy toward sin and yet claim an allegiance with the Lord.\nSin is serious. It is so serious that it cost the life of God\u2019s Son. God\u2019s will is that people who enjoy his forgiveness through faith in his Son live a new life to his glory (Romans 6:1-4)."}
{"prompt": "Jesus' early knowledge of his divinity", "completion": "Did Jesus know he was God as a human child? \n\n\nIn the days and years before the Lord\u2019s crucifixion and burial, Jesus did not always or fully make use of his divine powers, such as omniscience. The Bible tells us that Jesus, \u201cbeing in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death\u2014even death on a cross!\u201d (Philippians 2:6-8).\nWhile the Bible does not specifically provide information for your question, we do know that even before Jesus was born, Joseph and Mary knew that their child was Immanuel, God with us (Matthew 1:20-25; Luke 1:26-35). They would have had every reason to share that information with Jesus. What we do know from Scripture is that the 12-year-old Jesus was very much aware of his relationship with his heavenly Father (Luke 2:49)."}
{"prompt": "What does \"doing all to the glory of God\" look like?", "completion": "Hi Pastor,\r\nI have a question about what it means to do everything to the glory of God. Does that mean that our thoughts are to be constantly occupied with that task at every moment of the day--in the sense that we are to be consciously giving thanks and praise to God while talking to a friend, working at our vocation, watching a ball game, etc.? How could we even function in day-to-day life and concentrate on what is before us if that was the case? I guess I'm just confused about what this is supposed to look like in our day-to-day living. \n\n\nYou ask a very practical question. The answer is seen best by considering the instruction of doing everything to the glory of God (1 Corinthians 10:31) in its context.\nIn the preceding verses\u2014going all the way back to chapter eight\u2014the apostle Paul had been addressing the subject matter of meat sacrificed to idols. Christians in Corinth had divided opinions. Some were of the conviction that it was wrong to eat such meat since it had a track record of being associated with pagan worship practices. Others believed there was nothing wrong with the meat, so it could be eaten.\nHow did the apostle seek to resolve this? By leading the Corinthians to think of one another. Those who recognized their freedom to eat that meat were to refrain from doing so if their actions would lead others to go against their conscience and sin. Those who felt they could not eat that meat were not to condemn those who did. With his instructions, the apostle was teaching the Corinthians in a very practical way that \u201cNo one should seek their own good, but the good of others\u201d (1 Corinthians 10:24).\nAfter thoroughly treating the issue of food sacrificed to idols, the apostle made a conclusion: \u201cSo whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God\u201d (1 Corinthians 10:31). His point was that even something like taking part in a meal\u2014even if the menu included food that had been sacrificed to idols\u2014could be done to the glory of God when the Christian participants treated others with love and when they gratefully received the food as a gift of God (1 Timothy 4:3-5).\nWe do things to the glory of God, then, when we do what is right in the sight of God and when we show love to others.\n\u201cWhat does this look like in our day-to-day living?\u201d It is not the continual assessment of an activity, as you illustrated. That approach is reminiscent of pietists, who advocated continual soul searching for proper motives. Rather than the continual assessment of an activity, \u201cdoing all things to the glory of God\u201d would show itself especially in evaluating a course of action ahead of time: \u201cIs this something that will give glory to God?\u201d \u201cWill God be glorified by doing this?\u201d\nWith that in mind, we can eat and drink and take part in innumerable activities in life to the glory of God. And giving glory to God is exactly what he desires and deserves (Revelation 14:7)."}
{"prompt": "Sin and forgiveness", "completion": "I was wondering whether Lutherans distinguish between God's forgiveness as judge, on the one hand, and his fatherly forgiveness on the other? When a Christian falls into sin and goes to God for forgiveness, is this him being saved all over again?  Or is it more like he is restored unto fellowship? I'd hate to think that we lose salvation or even God's good love and favor every time we sin.\n\n\nIf you are asking whether Christians fall out of faith each time they sin, the answer is \u201cno.\u201d The apostle Paul describes Christians like himself losing daily battles in the hour of temptation, yet still enjoying the forgiveness of sins won by Jesus Christ (Romans 7).\nThis does not minimize the seriousness of sin, especially those sins that are deliberate and intentional. Following God\u2019s directives, Christians take sin seriously. They avoid it as best they can, and when they are guilty of it, they confess it to God and receive the assurance of his forgiveness in faith (1 John 1:9).\nThe apostle\u2019s point earlier in the epistle is that Christians \u201care not under the law, but under grace\u201d (Romans 6:14). And it is gratitude for God\u2019s gracious love that leads us to avoid sin and live for God (Romans 6:1-4)."}
{"prompt": "Chapter and verse divisions", "completion": "When were the chapters and verses added to the Bible?\n\n\nStephen Langton is generally recognized as the individual who was responsible for the chapter divisions of the Bible. Langton served as Archbishop of Canterbury and died in 1228. Credit for the verse divisions of the Bible goes to a Paris printer by the name of Robert Stephens in 1551.\nWhile some of the chapter and verse divisions are awkward, they serve a very practical purpose. Now, for example, we can just say, \u201cJohn 3:16,\u201d and many people will know what we mean."}
{"prompt": "The purpose of worship", "completion": "A friend has asked me:  Why does God require worship? Why does He require thanks, and praise?  When I do something genuinely good for someone else, I don't ask for thanks or praise or quid pro quo. It's nice if someone \"chooses\" to say thanks or notice that something was done for them, but it's not a necessary component. What is the purpose of \"worship\"?\r\n\r\nI have my own thoughts, but I would sincerely appreciate your answer to this very good question so I can share it with her!\n\n\nIn the Bible God does condescend and describe himself in human terms so we can better understand him. With that in mind though, our human comparisons to God and his attributes and actions can fall short. What I mean is that there is no comparison between a human act of kindness\u2014for which someone might or might not express gratitude\u2014and God\u2019s self-sacrificial love. The highest form of love is not our love for God or other people; it is God\u2019s love for us. \u201cThis is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins\u201d (1 John 4:10).\nGod does not hold out gratitude and worship as optional activities for people. It is his will for them (1 Chronicles 16:29; Psalm 96:9; Matthew 4:10; Revelation 14:7). And more than commanding our worship, it is the mercies of God in Christ that invite and encourage our worship of God (Romans 12:1).\n\u201cWorship\u201d can describe the joyful, thankful life of Christians. \u201cCorporate worship\u201d describes what Christians do together in God\u2019s house in worship services. What is the purpose of that worship, you ask? Corporate worship provides opportunities for the people of God to gather together to feed their souls with the gospel in word and sacrament. Corporate worship also provides opportunities for God\u2019s people to direct their praise and gratitude to God in ways that go beyond the praise they can offer in their personal lives. Corporate worship, too, is God\u2019s will for people (Hebrews 10:25).\nThe sinful nature in Christians wants nothing to do with personal or corporate worship. The sinful nature is an enemy of God (Romans 8:6). The new self in Christians desires and delights in doing what God commands regarding worship (Romans 7:22) and rejoices in opportunities to gather in God\u2019s house with fellow Christians to praise him for his love and goodness. As we build up our new self through word and sacrament, our desire to worship God will also increase.\nMuch more could be said about personal gratitude expressed to God and corporate worship, but I hope this helps you in your conversation with your friend."}

{"prompt": "Questions regarding Jesus' return", "completion": "I'm considering changing religions and in researching yours.  I read through \"This We Believe\" in regard to Jesus' return. You state some believable things in this section, however, you never quote the Book of Revelation. #4 and #5 in this section seem to be contradictory to each other.  Can you please just help me to understand your thoughts on what you believe when it comes to Jesus return? I'm trying to make the best decision in which church to go to.  Also, what is Paul's blessed hope? In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, I Cor. 15: 51-52.  Many state that is regarding the rapture as well. Regarding the 1,000 year time period, why don't you believe in an actual 1,000 years? I take it as literal, but would like to hear your explanation as to why you don't believe in this.  I know in the Bible it says a thousand years are like a day and a day is like a thousand years, but I'm not sure if that's supposed to be applied here.  \n\n\nWe believe from the Bible that when Jesus visibly returns to this world, the bodies of those who died will be raised and reunited with their souls (John 5:28-29). The Lord will judge all people on the basis of faith or unbelief (Mark 16:16). Because only God can see what is in a person\u2019s heart, Scripture speaks of judgment on the basis of how saving faith and unbelief showed themselves in daily living (Matthew 25:31-46; Revelation 20:11-15). The judgment that took place at the time of a person\u2019s death (Hebrews 9:27) will be made public, as will the judgment of those who are alive at the time of Jesus\u2019 visible return.\nFrom judgment day on, believers will spend eternity in God\u2019s presence with both body and soul. Their bodies will be glorified and freed from every weakness caused by sin (1 Corinthians 15:35-57; Philippians 3:21). From judgment day on, unbelievers will spend eternity in hell with both body and soul (Matthew 25:41).\n1 Corinthians 15:51-52 does not refer to a rapture of any kind. (1 Thessalonians 4:17 speaks of what will happen on the last day.) The verses explain how God will transform and glorify the bodies of Christians who are alive on the earth when Jesus returns visibly (just as he will do for those Christians who have died).\nNumbers in Revelation are symbolic (cf. the 144,000 in chapters 7 and 14). The 1,000-year time period of chapter 20 means anything but 1,000 years. We understand that to be the New Testament time period. Jesus made it very clear that his is not an earthly kingdom (John 18:36).\nThe 2 Peter 3:8 reference of \u201ca thousand years\u201d and \u201ca day\u201d simply describes how God is unaffected by earthly time. He is eternal and is not bound by time as people are.\nIf you would like to read more about these topics, I can recommend End Times: Jesus is Coming Soon.

{"prompt": "Receiving Communion in other churches", "completion": "I believe in the Lord's Supper as a sacrament, with the Lord's body and blood fully present.  I also agree with the practice of closed communion for WELS congregations.  Yet during my school year at college, I often don't have the opportunity to attend a WELS church.  Traditionally I have always stayed out of receiving Communion at other churches that do not treat Communion as a sacrament, however, more recently I have wondered if it is right to partake in Communion there, given I do not follow their false teachings.  More simply does closed communion exclude me from participating in communing in  non-WELS churches, since I follow the biblical view of Communion?  I'm too afraid I am acknowledging their false view even if I don't follow it, and would not want to dishonor the sacrament.\n\n\n1 Corinthians 10:17 (\u201cBecause there is one loaf, we, who are many, are one body, for we all share the one loaf.) teaches that the reception of the Lord\u2019s Supper is an expression of fellowship in the faith and unity of doctrine. There would be a false picture of unity if individuals who were not one with us in faith and doctrine would partake of the sacrament in our churches. Similarly, there would be a false picture of unity if you were to receive the sacrament with people who were not united with you in faith and doctrine.\nThe historic practice of closed communion has the intent of expressing a genuine picture of unity in the faith, not one that is false or forced, and ensuring, as far as humanly possible, that those receiving the sacrament will do so to their benefit and not their harm (1 Corinthians 11:27-32)."}
{"prompt": "Paul's sins in Romans 7", "completion": "Hello, Pastor,\r\n\r\nI have a question about Romans 7:14-25. I believe that Paul is here writing about himself as a mature believer in his struggle against sin. My question is, is it the case that the sins Paul kept committing were unintentional ones? I have heard that view put forth by some people but I doesn't seem to square with the text so far as I can tell. It doesn't always ring true to experience either. Thanks, Pastor.\n\n\nIn Romans 7:14-25 the apostle Paul explained the struggle that took place between his sinful nature and his new self. Certainly, Paul\u2019s sinful nature wanted to sin at any and every opportunity, but in this section Paul described how he fought to put down his sinful nature and instead live life God\u2019s way. In spite of that, he fell into sin. That is not the description of intentional sins.\nPaul\u2019s joy of course is our joy: there is forgiveness of sins through Jesus Christ (Romans 7:25)."}
{"prompt": "Marrying outside the faith", "completion": "I recently had a question posed to me by a teen in my church.  Can you offer me some guidance on addressing it?  If you marry a person with a different religion, would you take up their religion or stick with your own church? Would you go to your different churches?\n\n\nGood questions \u2013 and I\u2019m glad the teen asked them. I would offer a response by first underscoring the nature of marriage and the importance of having unity of faith and fellowship with a spouse.\nAccording to God\u2019s design, marriage is a union between one man and one woman. In marriage two people become \u201cone flesh\u201d (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:5). In marriage two people become one physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. Marriage becomes a team of two people intimately joined together.\nIn the areas where husband and wife become one, their spiritual oneness is most important. Can there be happy and \u201csuccessful\u201d marriages, humanly speaking, when husband and wife are not united in faith? Certainly. But something is definitely lacking in a marriage when husband wife are not united in faith. (1 Peter 3:1-6 addresses how Christian wives can best treat their husbands who are not united to them in the Christian faith.) Conversely, there are great blessings in marriage when husband and wife are united in faith.\nWith your particular questions in mind, I would encourage the individual from one of our congregations to remain with his/her church and not join the spouse\u2019s church. Husband and wife would most likely wind up attending their own church. That is hardly an ideal situation. The situation becomes even more challenging if/when God blesses them with children. Now, in which faith will their children be raised?\nWe can help our youth today greatly by emphasizing how important it is for husband and wife to be united spiritually. That means that we encourage our youth to talk about faith and church affiliation when dating. That means that we encourage our youth to put \u201coneness of faith\u201d at the top of a \u201cwhat is important in a spouse\u201d list.\nGod bless your conversations with the teen who asked you these questions. You both may want to know that there is worthwhile reading material on this subject from Northwestern Publishing House."}
{"prompt": "Fellowship with other Christians", "completion": "I read that WELS Lutherans don't \"fellowship\" with Christians of other beliefs. What is meant by that? Would you not pray with a non-WELS Lutheran over a Thanksgiving meal? If you lived in an area without a WELS Lutheran church, would you be okay attending an LCMS Lutheran church?\n\n\nElsewhere on this web site you will find these statements on our fellowship practice that answer your questions. (You can read the statements in context via this link. )\n\u201c5. We believe that God directs believers to acknowledge oneness in faith with Christians whose confession of faith submits to all the teachings of Scripture (John 8:31; 1 Thessalonians 5:21,22). We believe, furthermore, that individuals through their membership in a church body commit themselves to the doctrine and practice of that church. To assert that unity exists where there is no agreement in confession is to presume to look into people\u2019s hearts. Only God can look into people\u2019s hearts. It is not necessary that all Christians agree on matters of church ritual or organization. About these the New Testament gives no commands (Romans 14:17).\n\u201c6. We believe that those whose confession of faith reveals that they are united in the doctrines of Scripture will express their fellowship in Christ as occasion permits (Ephesians 4:3). They may express their fellowship by joint worship, by joint proclamation of the gospel, by joining in Holy Communion, by joint prayer, and by joint church work. God directs believers not to practice religious fellowship with those whose confession and actions reveal that they teach, tolerate, support, or defend error (2 John 10,11). When error appears in the church, Christians will try to preserve their fellowship by patiently admonishing the offenders, in the hope that they will turn from their error (2 Timothy 2:25,26; Titus 3:10). But the Lord commands believers not to practice church fellowship with people who persist in teaching or adhering to beliefs that are false (Romans 16:17,18).\u201d\nDo keep in mind that if we are not able \u201cto practice fellowship with people who persist in teaching or adhering to beliefs that are false,\u201d that does not mean we jump to the conclusion that they are outside the kingdom of God. \u201cThe Lord knows those who are his\u201d (2 Timothy 2:19).

Both the Old and New Testaments clearly command us to abstain from blood. (Genesis 9:4; Leviticus 17:10; Deuteronomy 12:23; Acts 15:28, 29) Also, God views blood as representing life. (Leviticus 17:14) So we avoid taking blood not only in obedience to God but also out of respect for him as the Giver of life.\u201d\nThe Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses greatly misunderstand the Old Testament ceremonial laws, which are no longer in effect today.\nOf even greater concern of course is the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u2019 rejection of the Trinity and the deity of Jesus Christ.

Their rationale for this understanding is that the color white in Revelation and elsewhere in the Bible represents holiness and purity. Furthermore, they point to Revelation 19:11-16, where the rider on a white horse, who is now wearing many crowns, is identified as Jesus.\nThen there are those who see the rider on the white horse symbolizing false Christs. Their rationale for this understanding is that the content of Revelation 6 closely parallels that of Matthew 24. The \u201cfalse Christs\u201d of Matthew 24:4-5 would correspond to the rider on the white horse in Revelation 6:2. In addition, they note that the rider in Revelation 6:2 is holding a bow (perhaps associated with the \u201cflaming arrows of the evil one\u201d in Ephesians 6:16) and not \u201cthe sword of the Spirit\u201d (Ephesians 6:17).\nWhile there may not be consensus on the identity of the rider on the white horse in Revelation 6:2, we can say that Scripture clearly teaches those two positions.

{"prompt": "Female police officer?", "completion": "In applying the biblical roles of men and women, is it wrong for a woman to become a police officer? There will obviously be times in her career where she will have to exercise authority over men. My understanding is that women being submissive to men is a general principle and applies to all areas of life, not just to marriage or church matters.

Those studies emphasize, as you pointed out, that God\u2019s principles of loving head and loving helper (Genesis 2:18; 1 Corinthians 11:3) do not become invalid when Christians live and work in society. For various reasons that those studies will spell out, Christian women may find themselves in vocations in which there is responsibility and authority over both women and men. If that is the case, Christian women will want to go about their work respecting the biblical principles of leadership. (And of course a Christian woman might steer clear of such vocations or positions for reasons of conscience \u2013 Romans 14:23).\nCould it be wrong for a woman to serve in law enforcement? Yes, if her motive for the profession were simply to deny God\u2019s principles of leadership and to exercise authority over men.

So, did Jesus step in and take the place of all people, receiving the punishment their sins deserved? Yes.\nIn This We Believe, a statement of belief of our church body, we confess this: \u201c3. We believe that Jesus Christ, the God-man, was sent by the Father to redeem all people, that is, to buy them back from the guilt and punishment of sin. Jesus came to fulfill the law (Matthew 5:17) so that on the basis of his perfect obedience all people would be declared holy (Romans 5:18,19). He came to bear \u201cthe iniquity of us all\u201d (Isaiah 53:6), ransoming all people by his sacrifice for sin on the altar of the cross (Matthew 20:28). We believe that he is the God-appointed substitute for all people. His righteousness, or perfect obedience, is accepted by the Father as our righteousness, his death for sin as our death for sin (2 Corinthians 5:21). We believe that his resurrection gives full assurance that God has accepted the payment he made for all (Romans 4:25).\u201d\nThe message of the Bible is that in Jesus we have a perfect Savior\u2014one who took our place in life and in death. \u201cFor just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous\u201d (Romans 5:19). \u201cChrist redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: \u2018Cursed is everyone who is hung on a pole\u2019\u201d (Galatians 3:13)."}

The struggle I have is feeling guilt over the consequences of my sins on my family.  I tend to get stressed out and lose it with my children.  Often I lack the patience I should be displaying and my children need.  We have a large family, so often there is conflict taking place within it.

Family members can be drawn closer together in the bond of love when they confess their sins to one another and forgive one another.\nIf you are concerned about \u201cleaving lasting marks\u201d on your children\u2019s lives in a positive way, one of the best things you could do for them is modeling the Christian faith in the areas of confession and absolution. Your children will learn a great lesson when you have reason to say to them, \u201cYou know, kids, we are all the same in God\u2019s eyes. We are sinners who have been forgiven by God. We all sin in different ways every day. Try as I might, I fail in my efforts in being the best parent I can be. Please forgive me for _______. With God\u2019s forgiveness, I want to do better in being his representative in your lives.\u201d Christian families can experience the \u201cjoy of salvation\u201d (Psalm 51:12) again and again when parents and children engage in heartfelt conversations of sin and forgiveness.\nAs you go about your parenting responsibilities, take heart in the fact that God works through imperfect people. In spite of our mistakes and sins, God can carry out his good and gracious will in the lives of others\u2014including our children. The truth of Romans 8:28 applies even to your parenting skills.\nFinally, I don\u2019t know if you are aware of a resource for parents through Forward in Christ. It\u2019s \u201cHeart to Heart Parent Conversations.\u201d This link will take you to the site. God bless you and your family!"}
{"prompt": "1 Peter 2:8 - \"destined\"", "completion": "In 1 Peter 2:8 it is written: \"They stumble because they disobey the message\u2014which is also what they were destined for.\" It seems that this means some people were destined to disobey God's Word, therefore leading to damnation. So, it seems this part of Scripture supports the doctrine of double predestination. On the other hand, God's Word tells us that He wants all people to come to repentance (2 Peter 3:9). God's Word cannot contradict itself, so how should 1 Peter 2:8 be understood? Thank you and God bless your faithful responses to all these questions!\n\n\nYou are approaching that Scripture verse with a correct understanding (and one given to you by the Holy Spirit)\u2014that \u201cGod\u2019s Word cannot contradict itself.\u201d Throughout the Bible, God makes it clear that he does not want people to perish eternally. \u201c\u2018As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live\u2019\u201d (Ezekiel 33:11). God \u201cwants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth\u201d (1 Timothy 2:4). It is the wider context of Scripture that helps us understand the Bible verse in question.\nIt is also the narrower context of Scripture that leads us to a correct understanding of that verse. In the previous verses of 1 Peter chapter 2, the apostle explained how differently believers and unbelievers regard Jesus Christ. To believers, Jesus is a precious cornerstone (v. 7). To unbelievers, Jesus is a stone over which they stumble (v. 8). These opposite reactions to Jesus illustrate what the Lord pronounced during his ministry: \u201cWhoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters\u201d (Matthew 12:30). There is no neutrality toward Jesus.\nBut what about the phrase in question\u2014\u201cwhich is also what they were destined for\u201d? (1 Peter 2:8) We know from Scripture that God, in eternity, has not predestined people to hell. Peter\u2019s words in verse 8 explain that those who reject Jesus in unbelief are destined to have Jesus as a stumbling stone and not a cornerstone. Unbelievers set their course for eternity by their rejection of Jesus.\nThe Bible makes it very clear that people receive the blame when they are lost eternally, while God gets the credit for people\u2019s salvation.\n(And thank you for your kind words!)"}
{"prompt": "Not always feeling forgiven", "completion": "I have been a WELS member for 30+ years.  I know and believe Jesus lived a perfect life for me and died to pay for my sins.  But I still sin daily, and many of those sins are sins I keep on doing even though I hate them and I hate offending God over and over.  It makes me wonder if I really believe that my sins are forgiven.  I know that when I feel the guilt of my sins that I should look to the cross and not at myself.  But I don't understand why I still feel guilty.  I wonder if I really have true saving faith.  Why don't I feel forgiven?  Can you offer any help?  Thank you!\n\n\nI do see you answering your own question in that you realize the need to \u201clook to the cross and not at myself.\u201d Facts, faith and feelings do not always align properly. Martin Luther wrote much about this. Here\u2019s an excerpt:\n\u201cWe must not judge by what we feel or by what we see before us. The Word must be followed, and we must firmly hold that these truths are to be believed, not experienced; for to believe is not to experience. Not indeed that what we believe is never to be experienced but that faith is to precede experience. And the Word must be believed even when we feel and experience what differs entirely from the Word. Therefore when in calamities our hearts think that God is angry with us, does not care for us but hates us, faith is nevertheless convinced that God harbors neither wrath nor hatred nor vindictiveness against us nor imputes our guilt\u2026To this conclusion I have come, not by way of my feelings or my present circumstances but through the Word, which says that the mercy of the Lord is over me and all who believe, that His wrath is over all who do not believe. Therefore I shall overcome my thoughts by the Word and shall write this promise in my heart, that after I have come to faith in Jesus Christ and do not doubt that my sins are forgiven me through His blood, I shall not be put to shame though all my senses and my experience speak a different language. Within myself I feel the wrath of God; the devil vents on me his hatred and the world its extreme fury. But the Holy Spirit tells no lies. He bids me hope; for \u2018with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him is plenteous redemption\u2019 (Ps 130:7).\u201d [What Luther Says. Vol. I. Page 513]\nHere is a way of understanding the difference between facts and feelings. I am 61 years old. Quite honestly, I feel half that age. But does that youthful feeling change my age? Not at all. I cannot lengthen the span of my life, as Jesus said (Matthew 6:27), and I certainly cannot decrease my age. My age is a fact; I am that old whether or not I feel like it.\nIn a similar way, God says to you: \u201cI have redeemed you; I have summoned you by name; you are mine\u201d (Isaiah 43:1). He promises you: \u201cThough your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool\u201d (Isaiah 1:18). Your Lord assures you: \u201cPeace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid\u201d (John 14:27). The peace of forgiveness is yours through Jesus Christ. That is a fact. You have God\u2019s own word on that. Your feelings do not negate that fact.\nWhen you find yourself losing the battle against sin, like the apostle Paul did (cf. Romans 7), find comfort and strength in God\u2019s gospel in word and sacrament. Through those means, hear the voice of your Savior who says to you: \u201cFriend, your sins are forgiven\u201d (Luke 5:20). Hear those words and, through the Spirit\u2019s power, embrace them in faith. Those words are factual, regardless of what your feelings might say. God bless your walk of faith."}
{"prompt": "Being sure of the truth", "completion": "I fully believe that Jesus is my Savior, that's not the question. The question is, How do I know that what I have been taught is the true word of God? There are so many religions that claim to be the true religion. How do I know that the WELS is?\n\n\nChristian faith is a matter of the heart, isn\u2019t it? Christian faith is the result of the Holy Spirit\u2019s work in a person\u2019s heart through the word of God. Because of that, Christian faith is not arguable or debatable. What I mean is that I cannot convince you or anyone else of the truths of Scripture; only God can do that. And God does that.\nGod can do that because his word is truly unique. \u201cFor the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart\u201d (Hebrews 4:12). The Emmaus disciples understood what the living word of God was all about when the risen Lord spoke to them: \u201cWere not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?\u201d (Luke 24:32) When you read Scripture, the Holy Spirit convinces you that it is truthful and that Jesus Christ is the world\u2019s only Savior (John 14:6).\nBeyond these matters of faith, I can point out these contrasts between Christianity and all other religions. Only Christianity speaks of a God who freely offers salvation (Romans 6:23; Ephesians 2:8-9). Only Christianity speaks of a God who gave of himself because he cared about people in their lost condition (1 John 4:10). Only Christianity speaks of a living Savior\u2014one who willingly died and rose from the dead (Revelation 1:17-18). Only Christianity speaks of the testimony of many witnesses who saw their eternal Savior (1 Corinthians 15:3-8).\nWhen it comes to visible Christian churches, you and I need to \u201ctest the spirits\u201d (1 John 4:1). We need to examine the confessions and doctrinal statements of churches and compare them to what the Bible says. Then we will recognize true and false churches. And then we will know whether or not to join together with them (Romans 16:17).\n\u201cNow faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see\u201d\n(Hebrews 11:1). Christian faith is Spirit-worked confidence and trust in what God says in his word. That same word is what God uses to create and strengthen faith (Romans 10:17). I encourage you, then, to \u201cLet the message of Christ dwell among you richly\u2026\u201d (Colossians 3:16) and to be a frequent guest at the Lord\u2019s Supper (1 Corinthians 11:25), so that the Holy Spirit has opportunities to convince you all the more that \u201cJesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name\u201d (John 20:31)."}
{"prompt": "Wrong to shop at a store?", "completion": "I have a few questions/needing advice for the recent decision of Target making their bathrooms transgender. I believe Target is liberal. Is it wrong for me to shop there since I don't support the transgender/gays/lesbians? By me shopping there, does it show to others that I support their decision on transgender bathrooms?\r\n\r\n Also, I recently had a friend say some harsh words stating that Christians are complaining too much about other people (meaning transgender people). My friend thinks we use God as an excuse to be hateful and stupid. Yes, we are sinners too. I just always feel like we as Christians cannot state how we feel about gays/lesbians etc., as we immediately get shot down, but those who do support that can say what they want and not get shot down for saying what they believe.\n\n\nIt is wrong for you to shop there\u2014or anywhere else\u2014if that is the message of your conscience. It is important for Christians to act in faith, not doubt (Romans 14:23).\nI Corinthians 8 can also provide some guidance. The situation in ancient Corinth is that Christians were divided over the appropriateness of buying meat that had a track record of being associated with pagan worship practices. The apostle Paul\u2019s instruction to those Christians was that buying such meat did not mean supporting false religions; buying and eating the meat could be done without any indictment of their actions. Still, if people\u2019s consciences told them it was wrong to make such a purchase, then it was wrong for them.\nPersonal boycotting of a business can guide actions that conform to conscience. Boycotting by many people can catch the attention of business owners and executives and lead them to examine their ways of doing business.\nWhile boycotting may change actions, our concern\u2014and God\u2019s concern\u2014is about changing hearts. That kind of change is not brought about by altering our spending habits but by sharing the powerful word of God (Hebrews 4:12), through which the Holy Spirit can lead people to confess their sins and profess faith in Jesus Christ.\nAnd when we do share God\u2019s word and live the Christian faith, we can encounter opposition and rejection, as you indicated. One of the ironies of our world is that the people who insist on tolerance become intolerant of Christians. Those people do not see their actions as being inconsistent; they often say that the intolerance of Christians (in their opinion) gives them reason to match that intolerance.\nSo what can Christians do in times like these? Continue to speak the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15) to others. The truth of God\u2019s word includes his law that condemns sinners and his gospel that embraces sinners. Continue to let your light shine (Matthew 5:16) in daily actions. When others condemn you for your words and actions, recognize that opposition as the Christian cross\u2014and then bear it gladly (Luke 9:23) and follow in faith the One who bore the cross for all."}
{"prompt": "Selling church property", "completion": "If a WELS church sells their current building because they are expanding and building a new facility, but they sell to a church that WELS feels preaches false doctrine, is that wrong?  The church made a profit in the sale to the Unitarian Universalists. We are taught that bake sales, pork dinners, salad suppers are wrong because it brings in money from other sources, but isn't selling a building to a church that teaches false doctrine also wrong?  Profiting from outside sources?\n\n\nThe real estate transaction you described would not be wrong. The scenario you described is that of a congregation relocating to a new site, necessitating the selling of the facility they no longer needed. If their assets\u2014especially the land value\u2014increased over time, then there was the potential to sell at a profit. Selling to another church, even a false church, would not be wrong.\nThere is a difference between a one-time real estate transaction and the other kinds of events you mentioned that might take place regularly in a congregation. It is possible for the congregational events you mentioned to give people the impression that the church cannot support itself financially and needs the financial assistance of others outside the church family. I would not equate the selling of church property with fundraisers that seek community involvement."}
{"prompt": "Broken to be saved?", "completion": "Recently I have been having many discussions with a young man who believes that you must be broken in order to be saved. What is the correct answer to this question?\n\n\nI do not have the context of your conversations, but I would understand your friend to be saying that the Holy Spirit needs to convict us of our sins through the law before he can bring us the comfort of forgiveness through the gospel. Before the Holy Spirit can bring the comfort of spiritual health and healing in the forgiveness of sins, he needs to impress upon people how spiritually sick\u2014spiritually dead\u2014they really are.\nThe Bible speaks of the Holy Spirit going about his \u201cstrange work\u201d and \u201calien task\u201d (Isaiah 28:21), as he convicts people of sin. When people are led to despair of their sins and reject any means of saving themselves, the Holy Spirit can then comfort people with the precious news of the gospel, pointing them to Jesus Christ.\nIt is the Holy Spirit, through the word of God, who carries out this work in the hearts of people. Through the word he leads people to confess, \u201cWhat a wretched man I am!\u201d (Romans 7:24). Through the word he leads people to confess, \u201cWith you [,Lord,] there is forgiveness\u201d (Psalm 130:4).\nAll this is the work of the Holy Spirit\u2014to whom we give special praise this Sunday, Pentecost Sunday."}

As he stood on trial before the Sanhedrin, and before an angry mob began to stone him to death, Stephen addressed the members of that religious court: \u201cYou stiff-necked people! Your hearts and ears are still uncircumcised. You are just like your ancestors: You always resist the Holy Spirit!\u201d (Acts 7:51) When God works through the means of grace, people can resist his power."}
{"prompt": "Purpose of Ladies Aid organization", "completion": "We are a small town with a membership of 150 people.  We can never seem to get  any ladies to join our Ladies Aid program. \r\nMy question is, what is the real reason to have a ladies group in the church?  What is our real purpose?  Suggestions would be great.  Thank you.\n\n\nYou ask a good question. Church organizations need to ask why they exist and what their purpose is.\nChurch organizations usually answer those questions with a mission statement of some kind. A statement might look like this: \u201cThe Ladies Aid organization of St. John\u2019s Lutheran Church exists to provide opportunities for Bible study and Christian fellowship for ladies of the congregation and to furnish occasions for service projects to the congregation and community.\u201d Those service projects might include making available the purchase of Christian greeting cards by members, coordinating congregational dinners and funeral luncheons, offering assistance to the pastor by serving as an Altar Guild, serving as a liaison between WELS Lutheran Women\u2019s Missionary Society (LWMS) and the women of the congregation, making worship service banners or customizing baptismal napkins, or many other activities that would fit your local situation.\nHere are some other ideas from the Women\u2019s Ministry section of the synod\u2019s web site.\nOrganizations\u2014whether they are in church or outside the church\u2014need to define their purpose for existing. If there is no real purpose, then there can be little surprise why an organization struggles to involve people in it.\nI would encourage you and your fellow sisters in Christ to brainstorm purposes for your Ladies Aid organization. If you do not have a mission statement, you could draft one, thus giving clear direction for the organization. No doubt, you would want to involve your pastor and other church leaders in your discussions and plans.\nGod bless you and the ladies of your congregation as you seek to imitate the example of the women who supported the work of the Lord and his kingdom (Luke 8:1-3)!"}
{"prompt": "Paul instructed by Jesus", "completion": "I was told that Paul was taught by Jesus for three years. Is that true?\n\n\nIn the opening chapter of Galatians the apostle Paul indicated the way in which he received instruction in the Christian faith. \u201cI want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel I preached is not of human origin. I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ\u201d (Galatians 1:11-12).\nLater in the same chapter the apostle mentioned his travels into Arabia and Damascus. After that he wrote:\u00a0 \u201cThen after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Cephas and stayed with him fifteen days\u201d (Galatians 1:18). The \u201cafter three years\u201d refers to the interval of time after his conversion and before he went to Jerusalem\u2014and not the duration of time he received instruction from the Lord.\nIt is challenging to piece together the events from Paul\u2019s life as described in Galatians and Acts. What is certain is that God intervened in the life of one of his most ardent opponents and turned him into a passionate and tireless kingdom worker. God\u2019s grace shown to you and me is no less amazing (Ephesians 2:1-10)."}
{"prompt": "The parable of the shrewd manager", "completion": "Would you please explain the shrewd servant parable in Luke 16? Thanks!\r\n\r\n\n\n\nThe parable describes a dishonest manager at work. After his dishonesty was discovered, he continued to be dishonest\u2014and shrewd. He cut deals with his master\u2019s debtors to try to pave the way for new employment once his present job came to an end.\nIn short, the manager mismanaged someone else\u2019s money for the benefit of his own earthly life. In verse 9 Jesus tells us to do just the opposite: to use our earthly wealth unselfishly for the eternal benefit of other people.\nCertainly, our financial support of gospel outreach and mission work is a way of using our earthly wealth for the eternal benefit of other people.\nOne of our hymns captures that thought well. \u201cMay our zeal to help the heathen Be increased from day to day, As we plead in true compassion And for their conversion pray.

{"prompt": "Church and state flags in church?", "completion": "I have been told that the origin of having the US and Christian flags displayed in our churches (often in the chancel itself) arose during WWI in an effort to show that German Lutherans were first and foremost loyal citizens of the USA.  Why is this practice still followed?  In view of the increasing hostility of government and society to the Christian faith, this practice seems out of place. In any case, correct positioning of the US flag is on the right-hand side of the \"speaker,\" but many churches have the Christian flag in that position. It would seem to me, if a congregation wants the US flag in the church, it would be better placed at the back. Comments?\n\n\nAs Scripture is silent on this topic, congregations are in a position to exercise their Christian freedom. Information from Christian Worship: Manual, the companion book to Christian Worship: A Lutheran Hymnal, provides information to help congregations examine their freedom in light of what practice might send the best theological message to worshipers.\nIn the chapter titled \u201cThe Worship Space,\u201d there is this guidance: \u201cSome churches like to include the national, Christian, and denominational flags in the chancel. While many Lutheran congregations have displayed flags of one sort or another, building committees ought to carefully analyze this tradition. Altar, pulpit, and font \u2018all point to Christ,\u2019 while national flags \u2018speak not of Christ, but of the nation\u2019 [Brugginck and Droppers, Christ and Architecture, pp. 250ff]. Especially in an age when so many Christian churches confuse the separate roles of church and state, it may be wise to place national flags in the narthex rather than in the chancel. The use of the Christian flag may promote an imprecise view of the church and false ecumenism besides. Denominational loyalty is important in a congregation, but recent history seems to indicate that it is better to teach loyalty to the Scriptures that cannot err than to denominations that can. The important work of the church body can surely be emphasized in better ways than with a flag\u201d (pp. 85-86).\nAgain, because this is a matter on which Scripture is silent, congregations do well to explain clearly their rationale for whatever their particular practice in this area might be."}
{"prompt": "Translating Luther's German Bible?", "completion": "I'm a Christian from a Lutheran Church in China.  Some people would like the German Bible translated from Greek by Luther in the 16th century to be translated into Chinese.  My question is whether it is necessary to translate that German Bible into English or other language now. \n\n\nBible translations are undertaken so that the message of God\u2019s word can be communicated clearly to people in a language they know and understand. Martin Luther\u2019s translation of the Bible was immensely important because it put the truths of God\u2019s word into the language that common people in Germany could understand.\nIs it necessary to translate Luther\u2019s Bible into English or another language? No. It would be preferable to translate from the original languages of the Bible\u2014Hebrew and Greek\u2014as Luther did. A translation of his translation would amount to a paraphrase.\nI understand that numerous Chinese Bible translations are available to you: for example, the Chinese Union Version, the Revised Chinese Union Version and the Chinese Contemporary Bible.\nIf you are interested in other Bible-based materials in Chinese, this link will take you to the Chinese section of Multi-Language Publications available from Northwestern Publishing House.\nGod bless your study of his word!"}
{"prompt": "Forgiving and forgetting", "completion": "It has been said, \"Forgive and forget.\" \r\nDoes the Bible state the same for mankind?\r\nThank you.\n\n\nGod is certainly one who forgives and forgets. He states with absolute certainty: \u201cI, even I, am he who blots out your transgressions, for my own sake, and remembers your sins no more\u201d (Isaiah 43:25). The writer to the Hebrews draws on Jeremiah 31 in relaying these words from God: \u201cFor I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more\u201d (Hebrews 8:12). God\u2019s forgiveness is complete.\nThe Bible\u2019s message is that people who enjoy God\u2019s forgiveness through faith in his Son Jesus Christ are to forgive others who sin against them. \u201cBe kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you\u201d (Ephesians 4:32). \u201cBear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you\u201d (Colossians 3:13).\nIn response to the apostle Peter\u2019s question about the frequency of forgiving people for multiple offenses committed against him, Jesus told the parable of the unmerciful servant (Matthew 18:21-35). The account ends with the Lord referencing the harsh treatment the servant who did not forgive others received, and then pronouncing: \u201cThis is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart\u201d (Matthew 18:35). In the sermon on the mount, after teaching his disciples to pray \u201cforgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors,\u201d Jesus warned: \u201cBut if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins\u201d (Matthew 6:15).\nForgiving others is our responsibility and privilege. Forgetting the sins people have committed against us may not be all that easy. There may be visible, ongoing reminders in life of some sins that people have committed against us. In addition, our sinful nature will not want to let go of the wrongs people have done to us. Still, trying to move on from the memories of other people\u2019s sins will be best for our spiritual, mental, emotional and physical health.\nHow can we grow in our Christian lives as \u201cforgivers\u201d and \u201cforgetters\u201d? Faithful, regular use of God\u2019s gospel in word and sacrament is essential. The more we understand and appreciate the great debt of sin that God has forgiven us, the more we will be motivated to forgive\u2014and forget\u2014the smaller sins that people commit against us (cf. the parable of the unmerciful servant)."}
{"prompt": "Is the soul immortal?", "completion": "I was raised with the belief that after death, our soul goes to either heaven or hell.  I have come across a few sites and posts about the immortal soul being false doctrine (from the Greeks).  \r\nSome of their supporting passages were Ecclesiastes 9:5, \"For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing; they have no further reward, and even their name is forgotten.\"  And 1 Corinthians 15:50, which says we are perishable until the last day, when we are made imperishable - and before that the perishable cannot inherit the kingdom. John 3:13: \"No one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man.\" And also Acts 2:34 says even David did not ascend into heaven. Is the soul immortal, or do we \"sleep\" until the last day?\r\n\n\n\nYou have been taught accurately. Numerous Scripture passages speak of human beings having an immortal soul. Here are a few such references: Genesis 2:7, Ecclesiastes 12:7; Matthew 10:28; Matthew 16:26; Luke 16:19-31; 2 Corinthians 5:6-9; Revelation 6:9; and, Revelation 20:4.\nEcclesiastes 9:5 needs to be understood in its context. Much of Ecclesiastes speaks of \u201clife under the sun,\u201d life in this world. With that in mind, the verse from Ecclesiastes accurately speaks of death removing people from this world. If there is any thought of Ecclesiastes denying the biblical teaching that people have an immortal soul, that thought is shattered in the last chapter of the book: \u201c\u2026and the dust returns to the ground it came from, and the spirit returns to God who gave it\u201d (Ecclesiastes 12:7).\n1 Corinthians 15:50 teaches that the bodies of believers, affected by sin, need to undergo a change, a transformation, before they can enter God\u2019s presence in heaven. Verse 54 of that same chapter speaks of that transformation taking place on the last day.\nThe context of John 3:13 shows us that Jesus is talking to Nicodemus about entering into God\u2019s kingdom. Jesus is telling Nicodemus that no one can enter heaven except through faith in Jesus as his/her Savior. In verse 3 Jesus speaks about being born again. People enter this world spiritually dead and they have a need for spiritual rebirth (Ephesians 2:1-10). In verse 6 Jesus says that the Spirit gives birth to spiritual life. In verse 13 Jesus explains that no one enters heaven on his own except the one who came from heaven, and in verses 15-18 Jesus says that only those who believe in him as the Savior will have eternal life in heaven.\nActs 2:34 states that David died, and yet before he died, he spoke in Psalm 110 of the Messiah to come. The apostle Peter drew upon this and another of David\u2019s psalms\u2014Psalm 16\u2014in his sermon in Jerusalem on Pentecost.\nWhen death takes place, body and soul separate. Any biblical references to sleep pertain to the body, which is motionless. The soul is in heaven or hell, based on Christian faith or the absence of it. Luke 16:19-31 illustrates that God\u2019s judgment is final and eternal.\nAll this demonstrates how important it is to attend to spiritual matters now (2 Corinthians 6:2)."}
{"prompt": "Reacting to unloving people", "completion": "How do you as a Christian react to people who irritate and  want to use  you for their own goodness?  I know we should be loving at all times, but sometimes it's tough to deal with certain situations. Any spiritual advice would help.Thanks.\n\n\nCertainly we want to \u201cbe loving at all times,\u201d and sometimes that love will show itself by rebuking people for their sins (Matthew 18:15; Galatians 6:1; James 5:20). I do not have the context of your situation, but if you are encountering sinful words, attitudes or actions from people, you can serve them best by pointing out their sin. No one is benefited when sin is ignored.\nRomans 12:17-21 can provide direction for your life. That section of Scripture speaks of not repaying \u201cevil for evil\u201d but overcoming \u201cevil with good.\u201d Our sinful nature of course would like to get even with those who sin against us and to harbor grudges against them. Our new self wants nothing to do with those sinful thoughts, but instead desires to show love even to those who do not love us.\nCertainly, keep bringing this situation to God in prayer. Keep praying that God will change hearts and lives. Keep praying that God will strengthen you to deal with the unloving attitudes and actions of others. Remembering that God provides strength for Christian living through his gospel in word and sacrament, keep using his gospel faithfully.\nBeyond that, I would have to know more about your situation to offer any specific advice. I wish you well and pray that God guides and blesses your course of action."}

{"prompt": "The Bible and suicide", "completion": "I have a friend who recently lost a relative to suicide.  She has been hearing from different people what happens to a person's soul when they take their own life.  Does God tell us what happens to someone who does?  Where in the Bible does it say?\n\n\nGod\u2019s fifth commandment prohibits the taking of someone else\u2019s life or our own (Exodus 20:13). God is serious about protecting a person\u2019s life because that is the only time a person has to be brought to saving faith in Jesus Christ. When life on earth comes to an end, judgment also takes place (Hebrews 9:27). People with saving faith will enjoy eternity with God, while unbelievers will spend eternity apart from God, in hell (Mark 16:16). While we do not know the judgment that takes place at a person\u2019s death, that judgment will be made public on the last day (Matthew 25:31-46).\nIn years past, individuals who took their own lives were often treated as a group: they were automatically considered to be people who were lost forever. In more recent times there has been a greater understanding of psychological and mental issues that might contribute to a person taking his or her life, while still dying in the Christian faith. This does not minimize the seriousness of suicide or its tragic effects on survivors; it provides explanation only.\nThe biblical accounts of suicide (1 Samuel 31:4; Matthew 27:5; Acts 1:25) do not give us hope for the individuals involved. But, again, we do not jump to the conclusion that all people who take their own lives are eternally lost. We leave the judgment of hearts to God."}
{"prompt": "Luther's opinion of the Jews", "completion": "What was Luther's opinion of the Jews?\n\n\nYour question is one that is asked regularly, so allow me to pass along part of a response to a similar question about Martin Luther that appeared in the October 2013 Forward in Christ.\n\u201cWas Luther an anti-Semite? Accusations of anti-Semitism against Luther usually stem from reading his 1543 tract \u2018On the Jews and Their Lies,\u2019 in which the Reformer used immoderate language and gave questionable counsel on how to deal with Jews at that time. While we have never endorsed what and how he wrote in that treatise, we also believe a fair, historically-sensitive appraisal of the man and his message will show the Reformer was not anti-Semitic.\n\u201cExcellent books have been written on this topic, but here we must limit ourselves to these brief points: Luther also wrote about Jews in sympathetic ways and rebuked European Christians for their treatment of Jews. Here\u2019s one example: \u2018The fury of some Christians (if they are to be called Christians) is damnable. They imagine that they are doing God a service when they persecute the Jew most hatefully, think everything evil of them, and insult them. . . . Whereas, according to the example of this psalm (14:7) and that of Paul (Romans 9:1), a man ought to be most heartily sorry for them and continually pray for them. . . . They ought to attract them by all manner of gentleness, patience, pleading and care\u2019 (What Luther Says: An Anthology, Vol. 2, 683).\n\u201cLuther\u2019s attitude is more accurately characterized as anti-Judaism rather than anti-Semitism. His opposition was not racial or ethnic, but theological. He was targeting people who persistently and vigorously rejected the truth of salvation through faith alone in Jesus the Messiah and Savior of the world. Luther wrote harshly against the Roman pope and his theological supporters for the same reason.\n\u201cLike everyone else, Luther was a child of his times. It\u2019s difficult for people today to put themselves into his historical context, yet it\u2019s unfair to judge him according to our standards of civility. Luther\u2019s language sounds cruel, but his opponents often used similar language, and literary style of the era included harsh ridicule, name calling, and deliberate excess. Ultimately we must conclude that the treatise in question doesn\u2019t represent Luther at his best. We cannot endorse or excuse what he wrote. From a historical viewpoint, it should not surprise us that he sometimes shared unacceptable attitudes of his day. What is amazing is how often he rose above his times and advocated magnificent and eternal truth, most of all the full and free gospel of forgiveness.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia", "completion": "All my siblings and I were raised Lutheran, but recently my brother has taken an interest in joining an Orthodox (ROCOR) church. I am a little razzled by the whole situation and I really have no clue what the Orthodox believe. I tried to search the Internet, but every article was about Greek Orthodox, and none of them were from a Lutheran perspective. What is the difference between Lutherans and Russian Orthodox?\n\n\nThe differences between confessional Lutheranism and The Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia (ROCOR) are similar to the differences between confessional Lutheranism and Roman Catholicism.\nMajor differences include the ROCOR\u2019s rejection of Scripture as the only source of Christian doctrine; they consider church tradition as an additional source. The ROCOR rejects the Bible\u2019s teaching that people are spiritually dead by nature, teaching instead that people can cooperate with God in their salvation. As with Roman Catholicism, there are also doctrinal errors regarding the Lord\u2019s Supper and prayer.\nPerhaps the best way you can serve your brother is to ask him if he understands the teachings of the ROCOR and how they compare to the Bible. Keep pointing him to Jesus Christ as his perfect and complete Savior. Pray that God guide and keep him in the truths of his word."}
{"prompt": "Earthly disciples knowing heavenly visitors", "completion": "Good afternoon.  I will try to make this brief.  I was born into a nominally Mormon home.  For most of my growing years my parents never attended services, so I went by myself for many years.  It was all I knew.  After joining the Navy and much witnessing by several people, I finally read God's Word.  I was convinced I was in the wrong place and resigned from the Mormon Church.  I did the Bible Church thing for a while, then the base chapel and finally nothing for several years.  I am now a member of an LCMS congregation.  However, from time to time Mormon doctrine still rings in my head.  Mormons believe in a pre-existence of our soul and when I read about the transfiguration, how would the disciples know who Christ was talking with having never met them before?  It does not concern me to the point of doubting my faith, and I don't lose sleep over it, but it does make me wonder.\n\n\nAs you have come to know and believe, the Bible does not speak of the pre-existence of souls. That is one of many false teachings in the Mormon Church. It is good to read of your dissociation from that church.\nThe transfiguration accounts (Matthew 17:1-13; Mark 9:2-13; Luke 9:28-36) are truly amazing. Two Old Testament prophets appeared with Jesus, who revealed himself in all his glory as the Son of God. Peter, James and John were there to witness that glorious sight.\nIt was Peter who wanted to prolong the experience by erecting shelters for the Lord, for Moses and for Elijah. How did Peter and his companions recognize Moses and Elijah, since their earthly lives did not come anywhere close to overlapping? That is a question Scripture simply does not address. What we can do is rule out any kind of prior meeting of those individuals in a pre-existent soul setting.\nWe can also look forward to the time when we will see all the individuals in the transfiguration account\u2014especially our Lord\u2014and all fellow believers. There will be no need to try to prolong the experience. It will be forever!"}
{"prompt": "Trying to understand predestination", "completion": "Could you please give me a detailed explanation of predestination?  I am currently reading the Concordia, but find it a bit hard to understand.\n\n\nI understand it this way. Open your Bible to the very first page. Genesis chapter 1 explains what God did in the beginning of time, when he established time. What is on the opposite page of Genesis chapter 1 in your Bible? In the Bible I mainly use, there is a table of contents. Imagine that page opposite Genesis chapter 1 representing eternity, before God created anything.\nNow imagine your name and mine on that page opposite Genesis chapter 1. That would represent the idea that in eternity, before God began his work of creation, he graciously chose people to be part of his family. That choosing was not because of anything God saw in people; he did not look into the future and elect people to be his own because he saw what they would turn out to be. Predestination is due entirely to God\u2019s grace, his undeserved love.\nAfter graciously choosing people to be his own, God sees to it that those same people come into contact with his gospel, are brought to saving faith in Jesus and kept in that saving faith until their lives on earth come to an end (Romans 8:28-30).\nScripture speaks only of a predestination, or election, to salvation. There is no counterpart like a predestination to damnation, as God makes it clear that he wants all to be saved (1 Timothy 2:4; 2 Peter 3:9).\nWhile predestination challenges our understanding, it is intended to be a comfort to us. The comfort is that our salvation\u2014from beginning to end\u2014is entirely God\u2019s doing. And when salvation is God\u2019s doing and not ours, in any way, there is absolute certainty about it.\nSo, the next time you read Genesis chapter 1, look over at the opposite page and visualize your name there. That will give you another reason to praise God for his gracious love."}
{"prompt": "The ark of the covenant", "completion": "When was the ark of the covenant's end? \n\n\nThe Bible is silent on what happened to the ark of the covenant. A common thought is that the Babylonians destroyed it, along with other temple furnishings and the temple itself, when they invaded Jerusalem in 586 B.C. Some Bible scholars wonder if the ark of the covenant was even extant at that time. Your question is one that the Bible does not answer."}
{"prompt": "WELS and the Athanasian Creed", "completion": "Every year, for Trinity Sunday, we read the Athanasian Creed in church. For me, it usually starts out great, as it's a logical explanation of what we believe regarding the Trinity. But then, as we get to the end, I read the \"whoever does not believe this cannot be saved\" and I cringe, if I read it aloud at all. How is this statement biblical? \r\n\r\nSalvation depends on one thing alone, faith in Christ as their Savior. Nowhere in the Bible (to my knowledge at least) is salvation dependent on believing the Trinity. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not downplaying the importance of the Trinity, or any other teaching of the Bible that doesn't grant salvation.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that pops into my head is the thief on the cross. It's possible that he heard Jesus talk before he was hanging next to him, maybe even heard him teach about the doctrine of the Trinity. The Bible doesn't tell us that though, but it does tell us that he was saved. \r\n\r\nThe definition of a creed is a statement of what we believe. In most cases, if a visitor asked what we believed, I'd point them to one of the other two creeds. I guess my question is this: why (and how) does the WELS agree with this creed?\n\n\nIn answering your question and addressing your concerns, it will be helpful to keep in mind that, as was the case with the Nicene Creed, the Athanasian Creed was written at a time of theological controversy in the church.\nWritten perhaps around 500 A.D., the Athanasian Creed stated scriptural truths to confront the heresy of Arianism. Arianism argued that Jesus Christ was a created being, so therefore he was not equal to the Father and the Holy Spirit. You can see that such a denial of Jesus is a rejection of the Bible\u2019s teaching of the Trinity; with that denial of Jesus, there would no longer be three persons of the Godhead equal in power and majesty and glory. The Athanasian Creed was drafted to combat the error of Arianism and state what Scripture says about the God of the Bible being a triune God and that there is salvation only through Jesus Christ, the God-man.\nThe wording of the Athanasian Creed does not demand that people understand the mysteries of the Trinity and the incarnation of Jesus Christ. The Athanasian Creed does declare that the only saving faith that exists is that which is centered in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the second person of the Trinity (Matthew 3:16-17; John 14:6; 10:30; Acts 4:12). Because the Creed states scriptural truths, our church body finds agreement with it and uses it\u2014if only sparingly\u2014in our worship services."}
{"prompt": "The name \"Jesus\"", "completion": "The name Jesus?  I have seen information recently that the name Jesus did not exist until about 400 years ago. What would the disciples have called Jesus by name?  Why don't we use his name from the time period he was on earth?\n\n\nIn the gospel accounts we will find the disciples addressing the Son of God with \u201cMaster,\u201d \u201cTeacher,\u201d \u201cLord,\u201d and \u201cRabbi\u201d rather than his personal name \u201cJesus.\u201d That was very much in keeping with what the Lord told his followers: \u201cYou call me \u2018Teacher\u2019 and \u2018Lord,\u2019 and rightly so, for that is what I am\u201d (John 13:13).\nIf we were to use \u201chis name from the time period he was on earth,\u201d as listed in the New Testament which was originally written in Greek, we would use the name . When the Bible is translated into other languages, that name becomes \u201cJesus\u201d (English), Ges\u00f9 (Italian), etc. \u201cJesus\u201d is the English form of the Greek name."}
{"prompt": "How did we get the Bible?", "completion": "I've heard there are a lot of old religious books that didn't make it into the Bible.  How did we get the Bible we have today?  Was there some kind of church council where they just picked which books belonged?\n\n\nMuch has been written on the subject matter of which you asked. What follows are excerpts from an article that appeared in The Northwestern Lutheran, the predecessor of Forward in Christ. The article addresses your questions well.\n\u201cFrom Scripture we know that there were many ancient books of a religious nature, which never became part of the Bible. Thus we read in 1 Chronicles 29:29,30. First Chronicles is a part of the Scriptures, but these books to which it refers as authorities are not. (See also 2 Chronicles 9:29, 12:15 and 13:22.)\n\u201cWho determined which books belonged to the Old Testament? The Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament made by the Jews living in Alexandria, Egypt, and completed by about the year 250 B.C., contains all the books we have in our Old Testament plus a few others. The Jewish Council of Jamnia in the year 90 A.D., however, accepted only those we have in our present Old Testament. Who was right, the Septuagint or the Council of Jamnia? And which of these was empowered to determine the number of the Old Testament books?\n\u201cIn determining the content of the Old Testament we are not dependent on the Old Testament believers living in Egypt around 250 B.C. or on the Jewish rabbis who gathered at Jamnia in A.D. 90. Rather, it is Christ who has made this decision for us.\n\u201cOn Easter evening Christ appeared to the apostles in the upper room and showed them his hands and his feet and ate before them to convince them that he was indeed the risen Lord. And he did more than that. He pointed them to the Scriptures, saying, \u2018This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.)\u2019 Luke continues: \u2018Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures.\u2019\n\u201cIn those words the Lord himself marks the perimeter of the Old Testament: the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms\u2013the same books we at present have in our Old Testament. Furthermore, no others are quoted in the New Testament as Scripture. For us that is decisive. No one can know better than our Lord. That Ezra and the men who worked with him originally collected these books is granted, but that is not the decisive issue. What our Lord said, however, is.\n\u201cDoes our Lord Jesus lay down any principles we can apply in judging the New Testament? Indeed he does. He gives us an advanced list of the writers when he says to his disciples: \u2018But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you\u2019 (John 14:26). He assures us that what they speak in his name and write in his name is God\u2019s Word.\n\u201cThis is also the witness of the rest of the New Testament. Paul, whom our Lord Jesus called as his apostle on the road to Damascus, wrote to the Galatians (1:11,12): \u2018I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up. I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.\u2019 And in Ephesians 2:19,20 he added: \u2018Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and aliens, but fellow citizens with God\u2019s people and members of God\u2019s household, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone.\u2019 The term \u2018prophets\u2019 refers to the Old Testament, and the term \u2018apostles\u2019 to the New Testament. Such is the testimony of the New Testament to itself.\n\u201cThis is the way Paul speaks about himself in 2 Thessalonians 2:13-15: \u2018But we ought always to thank God for you, brothers loved by the Lord, because from the beginning God chose you to be saved through the sanctifying work of the Spirit and through belief in the truth. He called you to this through our gospel that you might share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. So then, brothers, stand firm and hold to the teachings we passed on to you, whether by word of mouth or by letter.\u2019 And in his first letter to them (1 Thessalonians 2:13) he had already stated: \u2018And we also thank God continually because, when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men, but as it actually is, the word of God, which is at work in you who believe.\u2019 Paul taught that these writings of his were inspired, and the recipients of his writings recognized them as such.\n\u201cThe gathering and distribution of the New Testament writings began shortly after they were written. Paul, for example, tells the Colossians (4:16): \u2018After this letter has been read to you, see that it is also read in the church of the Laodiceans.\u2019 In other words, congregations and individuals who received these writings shared them with other congregations and individuals. In each case the testimony of the first recipients was available in addition to the witness of the individual writings themselves.\n\u201cIn 2 Peter 3:15 Peter speaks of the existence of a collection of Paul\u2019s letters. \u2018Bear in mind,\u2019 he writes, \u2018that our Lord\u2019s patience means salvation, just as our dear brother Paul also wrote you with the wisdom that God gave him. He writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.\u2019\n\u201cThe evidence is clear. God saw to it that the inspired writings of the apostles and prophets, which constitute our Old and New Testaments were collected and preserved. His inspiration authenticated them all. And above all, we have the witness of the Scripture itself.\n\u201cThus, as we investigate the history of the canon, there can be no doubt that the canon was fixed not by men, not by the church, but by God. The 66 books we have in our Bible are the books inspired by the Holy Spirit. As such they are self-authenticating. Yes, our Bible is reliable; we can trust its promises; nothing is missing!\u201d"}

Can you answer this question and tell me where in the Bible I can find the answer?

{"prompt": "God's approval of a relationship", "completion": "How you know if God approves of a romantic relationship? I like this person that I work with. \n\n\nIt would be nice if God gave you some kind of sign (cf. Judges 6:36-40), wouldn\u2019t it? What God does though is give you freedom in this area of life. People have freedom to marry or not marry (1 Corinthians 7:1-7). And they have freedom in the relationships they might enter into before marriage.\nWhat you can do of course is seek feedback from your circle of Christian friends and family\u2014especially your parents. You can talk to Christians whose judgment you respect and solicit their thoughts on your relationship with your co-worker.\nWhat you can also do is look at your relationship in light of what Scripture says about the way in which spouses are to treat one another (Ephesians 5:22-33; 1 Peter 3:1-7). You can ask yourself to what degree you find those attitudes and actions in your friend.\nWhile God does not prohibit a Christian from marrying a non-Christian (1 Peter 3:1-2), there are so many more blessings when husband and wife are united in the faith (Joshua 24:15; Ecclesiastes 4:12).\nYou may find it valuable to do some reading on this subject.

{"prompt": "Reconciliation efforts rejected", "completion": "What are you to do if you have wronged someone, (a fellow WELS member), but they seem to refuse forgiveness by ignoring your attempts at reconciliation? Are we to continue to reach out to the person? \n\n\nThe confession of the lost son in Jesus\u2019 parable (Luke 15:11-32) illustrates godly actions when we sin against other people. When he rehearsed his conversation with his father and when he actually met his father, he said, \u201cFather, I have sinned against heaven and against you\u201d (vv. 18, 21). The son realized that a sin against other people is a sin against God; a transgression of the second table of the law is a transgression of the first table.\nIt sounds like you have followed that example: you confessed sin to someone you wronged (and presumably also confessed that sin to God).\nAs a child of God you know and believe you have God\u2019s forgiveness. But now you desire the forgiveness of a fellow child of God. That is understandable and entirely in keeping with what God says in his word: \u201cBear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you\u201d (Colossians 3:13). Jesus spoke words of warning if people do not forgive those who have wronged them: \u201cFor if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins\u201d (Matthew 6:14-15).\nYou have made efforts at reconciliation, but those efforts have been rejected. So, what can you do? You and I cannot change another person\u2019s heart, but God can. Pray that the other person involved understands the seriousness of withholding forgiveness, and then does become reconciled with you. Continue to show love to that person. Your expressions of love may stir up a guilty conscience to godly action (Romans 12:20). Do your best to pattern your life after the apostle\u2019s instructions: \u201cLet the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace\u201d (Colossians 3:15). God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Baptism's pledge of a good conscience", "completion": "What's technically \"the pledge of a good conscience toward God\" (1 Peter 3:21)? It confuses me making baptism a confession of faith. Thank you.\n\n\nBaptism would simply be a confession of faith on our part if the \u201cpledge\u201d in the verse you cited referred to people\u2019s actions toward God. In the context of that section of Scripture, and the context of all of Scripture, the \u201cpledge\u201d refers to God\u2019s actions toward people.\nThe word that the apostle Peter used that is translated \u201cpledge\u201d speaks of a legal claim that may be made in court. Because baptism \u201csaves\u201d by bringing into people\u2019s lives the forgiveness of sins that Jesus won by his holy life and sacrificial death, baptized children of God can lay claim to God\u2019s guarantee that their consciences are clean. When God declares that sins are forgiven, they are forgiven and there is no legitimate reason for our consciences to lead us to think otherwise.\nAll this is reason for us to think daily of the benefits and blessings of baptism!"}
{"prompt": "The invisible church", "completion": "What is the invisible church and who is part of it?\n\n\nIn This We Believe, a statement of belief of our church body, we profess: \u201c1. We believe that there is one holy Christian church, which is the temple of God (1 Corinthians 3:16) and the body of Christ (Ephesians 1:23; 4:12). The members of this one church are all those who are the \u2018sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus\u2019 (Galatians 3:26). The church, then, consists only of believers, or saints, whom God accepts as holy for the sake of Jesus\u2019 righteousness, which has been credited to them (2 Corinthians 5:21). These saints are scattered throughout the world. All people who believe that Jesus is their Savior from sin are members of the holy Christian church, regardless of the nation, race, or church body to which they belong.\n\u201c2. We believe that this holy Christian church is a reality, although it is not an external, visible organization. Because \u2018man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart\u2019 (1 Samuel 16:7), only the Lord knows \u2018those who are his\u2019 (2 Timothy 2:19). The members of the holy Christian church are known only to God; we cannot distinguish between true believers and hypocrites. The holy Christian church is therefore invisible and cannot be identified with any one church body or with the total membership of all church bodies.\n\u201c3. We believe that the presence of the holy Christian church nevertheless can be recognized. Wherever the gospel is preached and the sacraments are administered, the holy Christian church is present, for through the means of grace true faith is produced and preserved (Isaiah 55:10,11).

You can see who belongs to those churches. By contrast, only believers in Christ are part of the invisible church, and because only God can look into a person\u2019s heart, only God knows who is a member of that church.

{"prompt": "The sacrifices of Cain and Abel", "completion": "On p. 99 of David Limbaugh's book \"The Emmaus Code,\" he quotes J. Vernon McGee as saying \"The life is in the blood. This is a great, eternal truth. This explains why Abel's sacrifice was acceptable and Cain's was not. It is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.\" He also uses Leviticus 17:11 and Hebrews 9:22 to back up his point. Is this an acceptable interpretation? The Genesis account doesn't appear to specify the reason for God's rejection of Cain's offering. \n\n\nLeviticus 17:11 points out how instrumental blood is in sustaining life. Hebrews 9:22 explains that in God\u2019s plan of salvation the shedding of his Son\u2019s blood was necessary to forgive sins. 1 John 1:7 states a similar truth. The animal sacrifices prescribed in the Old Testament ceremonial laws pointed ahead to Jesus\u2019 sacrifice on the cross.\nWhen it comes to God\u2019s acceptance of Abel\u2019s sacrifice and his rejection of Cain\u2019s sacrifice, the Genesis account simply speaks of God looking upon one brother\u2019s sacrifice \u201cwith favor\u201d and \u201cnot looking\u201d upon the other brother\u2019s sacrifice with favor.\nHebrews 11:4 informs us that it was not the kind of sacrifice the brothers brought that resulted in God\u2019s different reactions to their sacrifices. It was a matter of one brother (Abel) bringing a sacrifice to God out of faith in the promised Savior, while another brother (Cain) brought a sacrifice to God with a different motive. God\u2019s different reactions toward the brothers is explained not by what they brought, but by what was in their hearts. That account of Cain and Abel shows us already what we would learn from a later account in Scripture, that \u201cThe LORD does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart\u201d (1 Samuel 16:7)."}

{"prompt": "Harry Potter series", "completion": "Is fantasy acceptable for a Christian? Specifically Harry Potter, which  contains magic and witchcraft. I grew up with the movies, have read all the books, and have a ton of merchandise. I am worried that this is satanic? \n\n\nAllow me to pass along what one of my predecessors wrote for Forward in Christ a few years ago in response to a similar question.\n\u201cWhat is the WELS position on the Harry Potter series? Some say they are wrong and won\u2019t allow their kids to read them, while others let their kids read them.\n\u201cYour question yields no simple answer. Some are ready to hold a book burning and want our synod to ban books. They need one answer. Others see no harm from children (or adults) becoming absorbed in these books. They need quite a different answer. Allow me to offer answers for both extremes.\nBanning isn\u2019t necessary\n\u201cFirst, let me address those who lean toward condemning any reading of such books except to refute them. Most literature contains large quantities of things with which we disagree. Other than the Bible, we need to exercise discretion whenever we read. Developing spiritual discretion is an essential skill in an unbelieving world: \u2018Test everything. Hold on to the good\u2019 (1 Thessalonians 5:21). Much of what we disagree with in Harry Potter is quite obvious compared to far more subtle influences. When Satan wishes to do his worst, he doesn\u2019t wear wizard\u2019s robes but \u2018masquerades as an angel of light\u2019 (2 Corinthians 11:14). Much of what comes out of Christian publishers, containing subtle mixtures of truth and error, is far more dangerous than Harry Potter because the Christian may read it with his guard down. Couldn\u2019t a Christian parent read a Harry Potter book with a child and sort through what is right and wrong? Might that help children toward a lifetime of better discernment of what comes at them from all media? What\u2019s more, we would not say that every flight of a child\u2019s imagination is evil. A child (or adult) can find enjoyment in make-believe.\n\u201cIn one of the talks I had with my 11-year-old about these books, I reminded him that there is no such thing as good and bad magic, but all such claiming of powers apart from God is stealing God\u2019s glory. My son reminded me that he understood Harry to be literature, not life, by saying, \u2018I know, Dad, but he\u2019s fake!\u2019\n\u201cOne final warning: to set up as many rules as possible is not the heart of our faith. We would not necessarily be stronger Christians if we could boast that nothing tainted by the world has ever entered our homes or minds. Listen to what Paul said to those who were becoming a little too enamored by rules and regulations: \u2018Since you died with Christ to the basic principles of this world, why, as though you still belonged to it, do you submit to its rules: \u2018Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!\u2019? These are all destined to perish with use, because they are based on human commands and teachings. Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-imposed worship, their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body, but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence\u2019 (Colossians 2:20-23).\n\u201cIn the immediate context, Paul isn\u2019t addressing banning books, but a false asceticism that labeled as evil all physical things in God\u2019s creation. However, there is a principle for our discussion. As we work hard to keep evil from getting at us from the outside, the danger is that we forget our real problem is sinful hearts on the inside. My heart needs a daily humbling dose of the reality of my own sinfulness so that I run, not to find better rules, but to the cross of Christ for free forgiveness and for power to live in the world but not of it. Remember: those who caused Jesus the greatest trouble were the most scrupulous moralists of the day. \u2018Taste not! Touch not! Handle not!\u2019 was the Pharisees\u2019 theme song.\nCaution is needed\n\u201cBut now for the sake of those who may be waving high their Harry Potter books in triumph that Forward in Christ magazine has given its approval, allow me to sound some real cautions in your direction. Although fantasy books and movies have existed for years, the culture in which those books and movies appear today is vastly different from our parents\u2019 and grandparents\u2019 culture. We have moved from an outwardly Christian culture to one that loves anything \u2018spiritual\u2019 as long as it isn\u2019t biblical. Wisconsin Christians were rudely awakened to the shifting sands of our \u2018spiritual\u2019 brave new world when my state hired a Wiccan priestess (the Rev. Jaymi Witch!) as a prison chaplain. It is particularly among adolescents and young teens that interest seems to be on the rise in things bordering on the occult. In such a spiritual smorgasbord environment, isn\u2019t there reason for concern if our children idolize someone whose triumphs are riding his Nimbus 2000 broom and becoming as adept at casting spells as his schoolmates? The danger is one of developing a spiritually unhealthy fascination with things magical and superstitious.\n\u201cThe apparent progression of the intensity of the magic in the successive books of the series also bears watching. Allowing our children to read what may confuse and disturb them with little or no Christian guidance is spiritual child abuse, even if the vast majority of those children never try to make a feather levitate or run out to buy a how-to book on casting spells. The most deadly combination is a home without many words from Jesus but with plenty of words about Harry. Christian discernment doesn\u2019t flow naturally from sinful hearts. Discernment is a spiritual gift nurtured by frequent contact with the Spirit\u2019s inspired words. It\u2019s a gift best \u2018tested\u2019 under the loving guidance of mature Christians. Our sinful nature loves to twist Christian freedom into a \u2018cover-up for [doing] evil\u2019 (1 Peter 2:16). To soar above other supposed \u2018weak\u2019 believers by proudly boasting that potential spiritual traps can\u2019t bother us, leaves us sounding ridiculously similar to a fellow named Peter who crash landed amidst the flames of his boasts. Against such proud arrogance Paul wrote: \u2018So, if you think that you are standing firm, be careful that you don\u2019t fall\u2019 (1 Corinthians 10:12)!\nFinal thoughts\n\u201cWhere does this leave us? A banned book list substitutes limited rules for exercising sound wisdom and discretion. Nor is the answer to repeat the proud mantra of some in Corinth: \u2018Everything is permissible for me.\u2019 To that Paul answered: \u2018\u2018Everything is permissible for me\u2019\u2014but not everything is beneficial. \u2018Everything is permissible for me\u2019\u2014but I will not be mastered by anything\u2019 (1 Corinthians 6:12). Neither a blanket condemnation nor a blanket endorsement is the \u2018Christian\u2019 answer. Christians need to wrestle with such questions without imposing their best solution as the only suitable response for every Christian family. We must heed the warnings Scripture speaks both to those who add and to those who subtract from it! We don\u2019t need our synod to supply us with an Oprah Winfrey reading list nor a banned book registry. We need Christians well-versed in Scripture and growing in Christ\u2019s saving love for them\u2014who then share that regularly with their children. We need Christians wrestling in prayer for spiritual wisdom to live in the world but not be of it\u2014who then model that for their children.\u201d"}

The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.

They are God\u2019s servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience. This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God\u2019s servants, who give their full time to governing.

{"prompt": "Jesus' descent into hell", "completion": "What does the Bible say about Jesus descending into hell? \n\n\nRight before Jesus died on the cross he said, \u201cFather, into your hands I commit my spirit\u201d (Luke 23:46). When he died, his body and soul separated. His body remained on earth, while his soul went to heaven.\nOn Easter Sunday morning Jesus\u2019 body and soul were reunited in Joseph\u2019s tomb. Then the Lord descended into hell. 1 Peter 3:18-20 states: \u201c For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive in the Spirit. After being made alive, he went and made proclamation to the imprisoned spirits\u2014 to those who were disobedient long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built.\u201d\nJesus did not descend into hell to suffer for the sins of the world or to offer people who had died a second chance at being saved. He descended into hell to \u201cmake proclamation\u201d of his victory over sin, death and hell. It was a triumphal event. Colossians 2:13-15 alludes to that: \u201cWhen you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins, having canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness, which stood against us and condemned us; he has taken it away, nailing it to the cross. And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.\u201d\nIn the Garden of Eden God had prophesied his Son\u2019s victory over Satan (Genesis 3:15). When Jesus descended into hell, he proclaimed that victory."}
{"prompt": "Attend Confirmation Class early?", "completion": "My child is very faithful and loves going to church and loves God. He recently said something to the point of, \"I understand Communion and what reflection means. Why can't I take it?\" I asked him what it meant and he really described it! This brought up a question. What can I do if my child, 12, wants to take the Lord's Supper? Can I put him in Confirmation Class early?\n\n\nThe Bible of course does not speak of the rite of Confirmation. It speaks of training children in God\u2019s word (Psalm 78:1-8; Proverbs 22:6; 2 Timothy 3:14-16), confessing Jesus Christ as Savior (Matthew 10:32), examining ourselves before receiving the Lord\u2019s Supper (1 Corinthians 11:28) and partaking of the Lord\u2019s Supper often (1 Corinthians 11:25). Established in Christian freedom, Confirmation\u2014the rite and the formal course of instruction that precedes it\u2014addresses these important areas.\nThe common practice in our church body associates the time of confirmation with a child\u2019s education in eighth grade. Good order in the congregation (1 Corinthians 14:40) is maintained when the youth of the congregation attend Confirmation Class at the time the class is normally offered.\nIt is wonderful that your son has a basic understanding of the Lord\u2019s Supper. Thorough instruction in Confirmation Class will enable him to profess at the time of Confirmation that what he has learned is what the Bible teaches. Through the rite of Confirmation he will become a communicant member of the congregation. Among other privileges, that will enable him to partake of the Lord\u2019s Supper.\nPerhaps your son can use his desire to receive the sacrament and his Christian maturity to encourage his peers to be faithful in their Confirmation Class instruction. May he and we always cherish God\u2019s gospel in word and sacrament. God\u2019s blessings to you and your family!"}
{"prompt": "God's mysterious ways", "completion": "I heard someone say that bad things happen because each person has a choice between good or evil. Yet, it is my understanding that Luther argued cogently from Scripture that human will is in bondage to sin and therefore not free. It is only through God's grace that any are able to belong to Him. Yet, being human, we are troubled by this question of why. Must we, like Job, just accept that God's ways are so far above us that we should cease with our questions and accept that some things are a mystery?\n\n\nBy nature, my free will is limited to making decisions about my earthly life. By nature, my will in spiritual matters is only that of sinning and rejecting God. When God brings me to faith, he gives me a new heart (Ezekiel 36:26). I am a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17). I now have a new self that desires to live in harmony with God\u2019s will (Ephesians 4:24). I now want to love God and others as God instructs (Romans 7:22). However, I still have a sinful nature that opposes anything good and godly, and that creates struggles in Christian living (Romans 7:15-25).\nAs a child of God, my free will is much different than before my conversion. Now my new self wants to use the means of grace to strengthen my faith; now I want to follow God\u2019s law as a tangible way of showing my thankfulness to him for my salvation in Jesus his Son. However, even when I, as a child of God, want to do those things in life that are good and godly, I recognize that it is God working in me: \u201cIt is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose\u201d (Philippians 2:13).\nOur lives as Christians will be more peaceful when we realize that, yes, there are mysteries of our faith and that it is not up to us to understand everything about God and his ways. The apostle Paul\u2019s doxology in the book of Romans directs us to stand in humble awe of God when we are confronted by God\u2019s mysteries: \u201cOh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out! \u2018Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?\u2019 \u2018Who has ever given to God, that God should repay them?\u2019 For from him and through him and for him are all things. To him be the glory forever!

{"prompt": "A Christian view of wealth", "completion": "Is Ecclesiastes 5:18-20 for Christians? What about verses like Matthew 6:19-21, Matthew 6:24, and Luke 12:33-34? Is 1 Timothy 6:17-19 a summary of how Christians can both enjoy earthly blessings as well as store up for heavenly blessings? Is everyone under a test from God, then, as to how we will use our earthly blessings with the reward being heavenly blessings? This is my reasoning, but I just want to confirm that my reasoning is biblically correct. Thank you and God bless.\n\n\nYes, those words from Ecclesiastes 5 apply to Christians. Christians recognize that God is the source of all their blessings. In his wisdom and love God bestows earthly blessings upon his children. God\u2019s gifts are good and perfect (James 1:17), and his children can receive them with thanksgiving and enjoyment (1 Timothy 4:4-5).\nIf God chooses to lavish earthly blessings on his children, those gifts too are good and perfect. Earthly wealth in and of itself is not evil. Earthly wealth becomes a problem when people value it more than God. That is a message of God\u2019s first commandment.\nWhile Christians are appreciative of God\u2019s earthly blessings to them, they recognize how much more important God\u2019s spiritual blessings to them are. The soul is much more important than the body. Jesus highlighted that truth when he asked: \u201cWhat good will it be for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul? (Matthew 16:26) The title of one of our hymns can go a long way in answering those questions: \u201cTake the world, but give me Jesus\u201d (CW 355).\nWhen we consider the temptations that both poverty and wealth can pose, we can appreciate this request made to God: \u201c\u2026give me neither poverty nor riches, but give me only my daily bread\u201d (Proverbs 30:8). Contentment with God\u2019s earthly blessings is a secret we all need to learn (Philippians 4:12).\nFinally, God does promise to bless faithful usage of the possessions he has entrusted to us (e.g., Luke 19:11-27). Those blessings are extra evidences of his love\u2014going beyond his gifts of forgiveness of sins and eternal life."}
{"prompt": "Regular use of the Nicene Creed", "completion": "Since going to every Sunday Communion we always say the Nicene Creed.

At the same time, Christians have historically\u2014for centuries\u2014used the Nicene Creed in Holy Communion services. There is something to be said about worship practices that tie us to Christians throughout the ages.\nYour question is one that you could certainly direct to your pastor and worship committee. Their rightful concern is that the worship of the congregation be vibrant and engaging and not mundane. That concern can manifest itself even in this regard: in explaining and educating congregational members on the liturgies we use week after week. God bless your worship of him!"}
{"prompt": "Cremation or burial?", "completion": "Is it okay to be cremated?\n\n\nSince the Bible is silent on the subject of cremation, Christians are free to choose burial or cremation.\nThere was a time not that long ago when some voices in the Christian church cautioned against cremation. In a day and age when some unbelievers utilized cremation as a way to defy God (\u201cLet\u2019s see if this supposed God can put me back together some day.\u201d), some Christians advocated that followers of the Lord not cremate their bodies, so as not to be associated with unbelievers or an activity of unbelievers. That element of taunting God has largely disappeared from the practice of cremation, so Christians today who make use of cremation are not likely to be confused with unbelievers.\nThe choice of cremation over burial often includes ecological, economical and convenience factors. In the end, cremation essentially speeds up the process that occurs with burial: \u201cDust you are and to dust you will return\u201d (Genesis 3:19). And, regardless of cremation or burial, \u201c\u2026all who are in their graves will hear his [Jesus\u2019] voice and come out\u201d (John 5:28-29).

{"prompt": "Does God place things on our hearts?", "completion": "My fellow WELS friend and I have been discussing an array topics lately. She is very skeptical of non-denominational churches, and their seemingly emotional basis of faith and God. She is very turned off by the mystical terms that many of them use about feeling God, and their relationship with God, based on their own human emotions and feeling. I agree with her, mostly. Lately, though, we were discussing the phrase that \"God placed this on my heart\" (to do or carry out some Christian task). She feels that this is another non-denomination emotional response. I agree that I don't believe God will whisper what I should make for dinner in my ear. But I do feel that there are certain life events that we pray for guidance about, and God answers our prayers about what we should do and how we can serve him best. I feel like I have felt God's hand in my own life, directing me to certain decisions in the past. I know that God has a perfect plan in place for each of us, so does he ever reveal that plan by \"placing an urge to fulfill his plan on our heart?\"\n\n\nThe prophet Jeremiah was a person who had reason to speak along the lines of \u201cGod placed something on my heart.\u201d But in the twentieth chapter of the book that bears his name he put it a little differently. \u201cYou deceived me, LORD, and I was deceived; you overpowered me and prevailed. I am ridiculed all day long; everyone mocks me. Whenever I speak, I cry out proclaiming violence and destruction. So the word of the LORD has brought me insult and reproach all day long. But if I say, \u2018I will not mention his word or speak anymore in his name,\u2019 his word is in my heart like a fire, a fire shut up in my bones. I am weary of holding it in; indeed, I cannot\u201d (Jeremiah 20:7-9).\nGod had called Jeremiah to relay messages to the people of Judah. Many of those people rejected Jeremiah\u2019s messages. Consequently, the prophet was tempted to reduce his rejection by keeping quiet about God. But you notice Jeremiah couldn\u2019t do that. When he thought of stifling God\u2019s message, he noted that God\u2019s \u201cword is in my heart like a fire, a fire shut up in my bones. I am weary of holding it in; indeed, I cannot\u201d (verse 9).\nGod\u2019s word was the driving force in Jeremiah\u2019s life and ministry. God\u2019s word moved the prophet into action in life. We could say the same thing about God\u2019s word being a motivating force in our lives. Let me provide a few examples.\nWe know that God wants us to share his word with all people. Perhaps I read an article in Forward in Christ about our synod\u2019s world mission work. Perhaps my reaction to the information in the article, then, is more fervent prayer for the Holy Spirit\u2019s blessing on the spread of God\u2019s word and increased personal mission offerings. Did God place something on my heart, or did the living and active word of God (Hebrews 4:12), planted in me (James 1:21), move me into action? I would opt for the latter.\nWe also know that God wants us to help others as we can, as opportunities arise (Galatians 6:10). Suppose I see news reports of people losing their homes to wildfires and raging floods. Suppose my reaction is a gift to our synod\u2019s Christian Aid and Relief. Did God place something on my heart, or did the living and active word of God move me into action? Again, I would opt for the latter. God certainly provides opportunities for doing good works (Ephesians 2:10), but it all comes back to his word.\nWhether it is confessing sin to someone I have wronged or sharing a word of encouragement from God\u2019s word with my neighbor, I can trace godly actions to God\u2019s word which provides direction and motivation. Whether my actions were prompted by something I read this morning in the Bible or by something I remembered from Sunday\u2019s sermon, I can link my acts of Christian love to God\u2019s word.\nIt is definitely God \u201cwho works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose\u201d (Philippians 2:13), and he works in you and me through his word."}
{"prompt": "Salvation without being baptized?", "completion": "Can a person go to heaven if they have never been baptized?\n\n\nYes. Think of all the Old Testament believers who were not baptized\u2014as baptism had not yet been instituted. Jesus stated that it is the lack of faith, not baptism, that condemns (Mark 16:16).\nWe speak of baptism being necessary in the sense that the Lord commands us to administer baptism. However, baptism not absolutely necessary for salvation because the Holy Spirit can bring people to saving faith in Jesus through the gospel in Word alone. In situations like that, people will still want to be baptized\u2014to do what Jesus says and to receive, in addition to the message of the Bible, another guarantee of God\u2019s love and forgiveness in Christ."}
{"prompt": "Belonging to labor unions", "completion": "Is it biblically incorrect to work for a union such as teamsters or labor unions? \n\n\nThe Bible does not address the subject of labor unions. It does speak of treating workers fairly (e.g., James 5:4).\nAs with any organization to which you might belong, concerns about how an organization represents you in society and uses your financial resources would be fitting. If you disagree with that representation and your conscience is bothered, re-examining your association with the organization would also be appropriate."}
{"prompt": "Needing the services of a pastor", "completion": "Staying connected to God when your loved one has terminal cancer. How can a member stay connected and grow closer to God during his last days if pastor doesn't share word and sacrament, if treatment or illness keeps cancer patient from attending church? We get sporadic, at best, calls most initiated by family. Occasional phone calls from appointed member but never sharing God's word or sacrament. When asking, I am told pastor is too busy. Is there a way to help people who can't get to church stay connected to God and grow in faith and partake of the sacrament and hear God's word?\n\n\nI trust that this is an unfortunate case of communication in the congregation that has gone awry somehow. The divine call that pastors receive to serve a congregation charges them: \u201cTo discharge toward all the members of our congregation the functions of a pastor, that is, to watch over their souls in an evangelical manner (Acts 20:28); in particular to visit the sick and the dying, to admonish indifferent and erring members (2 Timothy 4:2) and to be ever zealous for the winning of souls for Christ\u2019s kingdom.\u201d\u00a0 [italics added]\nYour pastor has been called to do the very thing you are asking: to minister with word and sacrament to those who are unable to attend worship services and to visit the sick and dying. Do contact your pastor and make him aware again of your loved one\u2019s situation. Request a visit. If necessary, enlist the help of a friend to make contact. When necessary, contact the chairman of your congregation\u2019s board of elders.\nI encourage you and your loved one to keep focused on Jesus (Hebrews 12:2), knowing and trusting him that you are safe in his hands, possessing the eternal life he won (John 10:27-30).

{"prompt": "Man and woman roles", "completion": "I have learned much about having a better marriage through understanding a husband's loving headship and a wife's way of serving God by respectfully helping her husband.  However, as a woman, I am still wondering about the origin of subordination. As far as I have come to understand, there are two competing views.\r\n\r\n1) In the beginning, God made the woman when Adam realized that all the animals had a fitting counterpart while he was all alone. He made her to make Adam happy, to be his companion through life, to overcome loneliness and have children. This does not necessarily mean that she was less than Adam, since having him also made her happy and gave her a counterpart, too.  \r\n\r\n2) Two arguments are brought forth: \r\nPaul says \"Adam was made first\" (1 Tim 2,13), thus making it clear that there must be some special value attached to men, since Adam was made \"just like that,\" for man to be made, while Eve was made for Adam, as some kind of accessory. Thus, men must be worth more than women in some way at least. The wife has been made for the sake of the husband, which proves that God had some kind of subordination in mind from the very beginning and women are somewhat second class (even though God loves them and Christ has fully redeemed them as sinners).  \r\n\r\nWhich side is right?  I would very much appreciate a theologically sound answer.\r\n\n\n\nThe first view is closer to the truth of Scripture. It is clear from the Bible that men and women are equal in God\u2019s eyes: \u201cSo in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham\u2019s seed, and heirs according to the promise\u201d (Galatians 3:26-28). There are no second class citizens in God\u2019s kingdom; all members\u2014male and female\u2014of God\u2019s kingdom are kings and priests in his sight (1 Peter 2:9; Revelation 1:6). The different and complementary roles and callings that God has given to men and women do not negate their equality before God.\nThe best thing I could do is to suggest further reading on this subject. This link will take you a doctrinal statement of our church body on the scriptural principles of man and woman roles. This next link will provide you with a study titled Man and Woman in God\u2019s World. These documents will provide you with theologically sound answers to your questions and concerns."}
{"prompt": "Dying while sinning", "completion": "If a Christian dies during a sinful act, will they receive God's forgiveness by their faith and have eternity in heaven?\n\n\nChristians are sinners/saints until life on earth comes to an end. Then, they are no longer sinners but only saints in God\u2019s eyes. Until life\u2019s end Christians possess a sinful nature, they wage war against Satan and his evil forces, and they remain vigilant to all that is evil in this world.\nIn spite of their best intentions and efforts, Christians sin. We distinguish between sins of weakness which do not cause us to lose our faith (Romans 7:15-25) and deliberate sins that can drive saving faith from the heart (Hebrews 10:26-27). Because of this distinction, the response to your question could go in different directions.\nThe comfort you and I have is that Christians stand in God\u2019s grace through faith in Jesus Christ (Romans 5:2). We are wrapped in God\u2019s forgiving love. When we stumble into sin out of weakness, we confess our sins to God. But even then our confession does not earn forgiveness from God. Forgiveness is God\u2019s free gift. \u201cForgiven\u201d is our daily status as Christians. If earthly life ends without the opportunity to confess sins of weakness, we still stand in God\u2019s grace and can look forward to standing in his presence.\nGod of course is the judge of people\u2019s hearts (Hebrews 4:13). His pronouncement of what is in people\u2019s hearts at the end of life is entirely accurate. It is finally Christian faith that saves and unbelief that condemns (Mark 16:16).\nYour question is a reminder to take sin seriously\u2014because of the high cost that was involved to forgive our sins (1 Peter 1:18-19) and the deadly nature of sin (Romans 6:23). Your question is a reminder to say \u201cno\u201d to sin and \u201cyes\u201d to godly living (Titus 2:12)."}
{"prompt": "The extent of Job's sufferings", "completion": "How long did Job suffer?\n\n\nIn one sense I could say, \u201cAll his life.\u201d That is because the Bible states that \u201cWe must go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of God\u201d (Acts 14:22) and because Jesus assured his followers that they would experience trouble in this world (John 16:33).\nBut I presume you are referencing the specific sufferings brought on by Satan\u2019s actions in Job\u2019s life, which God allowed in his wisdom and love. The Bible does not lay out a timeline of those sufferings.\nWhat the Bible does tell us is that when Job\u2019s satanic sufferings came to an end, \u201cThe LORD blessed the latter part of Job\u2019s life more than the former part\u201d (Job 42:12).\nIt was a wise and loving God who allowed Job to experience those particular sufferings. We can describe God in that same way when we find ourselves in the midst of sufferings (Hebrews 12:4-11; 1 Peter 1:3-9)."}
{"prompt": "Jehovah's Witnesses and heaven", "completion": "I am wondering how to respond to the Jehovah's Witnesses who come to my door.  Lately, they seem to want to bring people to their faith by bringing up the point that they believe that they will inherit a new restored earth with no violence.  They stress that they will enjoy the blessings of earth (family, fishing, building, etc.) and that they wouldn't want to spend eternity in heaven (What would you do when you can enjoy the earthly blessings?).  They reference Psalm 37:10-11 and how the meek will inherit the earth and enjoy peace on earth.  They also cite the Lord's Prayer (Thy Kingdom come, on earth as it is in heaven) and other passages in Isaiah referring to a new earth.  My question is which passages can I refer them to to show that we will not be brought back to earth but will enjoy the blessings of heaven.  What passages seem to hit the heart of Jehovah's Witnesses to show that we will not return to a restored earth after it is destroyed.  The Jehovah's Witnesses I have talked to seem to be stuck on a few references and examples that  they have been taught and refer back to those examples often in their talks with me,  Thanks and May God bless our efforts to reach out to the Jehovah's Witnesses with the truths of Scripture.  \n\n\nOne of the errors of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses is their belief that only 144,000 people will go to heaven, while the overflow crowd will have an eternal home on a new earth. Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses understand the numbers of Revelation 7:4-8 literally but the tribes figuratively. In addition, they fail to grasp what the apostle John writes immediately after that: \u201cAfter this I looked, and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb\u201d (Revelation 7:9). Heaven\u2019s capacity is not comparable to the population of Mesquite, Texas.\n(On a side note, the phrase in the Lord\u2019s Prayer, \u201con earth as it is in heaven,\u201d belongs with \u201cyour will be done\u201d not \u201cyour kingdom come.\u201d)\nWhat the Bible does teach (Isaiah 65:17; 66:22; 2 Peter 3:13; and, Revelation 21:1) is that on the last day God will destroy this world as we know it and fashion a new world to be the eternal home for his people.\nBut more than being wrong on how many people will be in heaven, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses are wrong on how people get to heaven. They deny the Trinity and Jesus\u2019 deity\u2014being co-equal with the Father (John 10:30). Sadly, theirs is a religion based on work righteousness.\nWhat you can do in your next conversation with Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses is ask them what they are doing to enjoy God\u2019s forgiveness. When they point to their deeds, show them the demands of God\u2019s law. \u201cBe perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect\u201d (Matthew 5:48). \u201cFor whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it\u201d (James 2:10). \u201cThe wages of sin is death\u201d (Romans 6:23). Explain that there is no salvation through people\u2019s efforts to keep God\u2019s law (Romans 3:20).\nThen, direct them to Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God (Matthew 26:63-64; John 8:58). Point them to Jesus\u2019 perfect life (Romans 10:4) and sacrificial death (Ephesians 1:7) as the only means by which God has forgiven the sins of people.\nLike me, you recognize that all we can do is speak the truths of God\u2019s word to people. We cannot control what happens after that. But do pray that God will use your witnessing to change hearts and lives and lead people to trust in Jesus alone for their salvation.\nIf you find yourself hosting Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses regularly at your home, you might benefit from these resources from Northwestern Publishing House.

{"prompt": "The Bible and Christians' giving", "completion": "Does the Bible give a specific amount/percentage of income that we should give to the ministry (like 10%), or are we Christians to give generously as we feel fit without a specific percentage in mind?\n\n\nNew Testament Christians enjoy freedom from the Old Testament ceremonial laws, including the tithe. Scripture does offer the guidance to New Testament followers of the Lord that offerings be in keeping with our income (1 Corinthians 16:2). Planning and giving back to the Lord based on a percentage of our income is definitely a scriptural approach. In essence, the tithe has been replaced by ___%. New Testament followers of the Lord are free to fill in the blank.\nRecognition that \u201cour\u201d money belongs to God (Psalm 24:1; Haggai 2:8) and gratitude for our salvation (Romans 12:1) provide good reasons for proportionate giving that is generous and cheerful (2 Corinthians 9:7).\nThe value of a percentage-based approach to giving is that it enables the giver to manage the fluctuations of income and still follow a plan for giving back to the Lord."}
{"prompt": "The Christian and paying taxes", "completion": "In  Matthew 22:17-21 Jesus instructs us to pay the taxes due the government.   When we are informed that our government is using tax dollars for the support of wicked and sinful enterprises such as Planned Parenthood (abortion), how are we to look at paying taxes?\n\n\nSome representatives of God in government (and the church and the home) represent him well, while others do not. The Caesar whose likeness was on the denarius presented to Jesus in Matthew 22:19-21 was one of those authorities who failed miserably in representing God faithfully. That was also the case with the Caesar in power when the apostle Paul wrote: \u201cGive to everyone what you owe them: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor\u201d (Romans 13:7). Neither our Lord nor his apostle qualified the directive to pay taxes to the Roman government, which even funded idolatrous worship practices.\nWhat Christian citizens certainly want to do is contact those who represent them in government when tax revenues are used in ungodly ways. Let your voice be heard!\nAnd more than communicating with your representatives, speak to the King of kings in prayer. Carry out what that same apostle wrote: \u201cI urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people\u2014for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness\u201d (1 Timothy 2:1-2).

{"prompt": "A flat earth?", "completion": "Is the idea of a flat earth unbiblical? Does it contradict the Bible in any way? I've read up on flat earth out of curiosity, and the main reason for a Christian to believe flat earth exists is that it would be almost undeniable proof that God exists. Globe earth is a secular evolutionary theory and suggests that we are nothing special, but a speck in the universe and we evolved from animals.  In a flat earth model, we would be the crown of God's creation. It seems possible Satan would deceive people through science like this. \n\n\nIt could be that people imagined the world to be flat from reading passages like Isaiah 11:12 (\u201cHe will raise a banner for the nations and gather the exiles of Israel; he will assemble the scattered people of Judah from the four quarters of the earth.) and Revelation 7:1 (After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth to prevent any wind from blowing on the land or on the sea or on any tree.).\nIn his word, however, God often uses language to come down to our level so that we can understand him and his ways better. The \u201cfour quarters\u201d and \u201cfour winds\u201d match up with the four directions (Luke 13:29). In the Bible God even used the terminology of people\u2019s understanding of his creation (cf. Joshua and the sun standing still, Joshua 10:1-15).\nThroughout Scripture there is a need to understand the varied ways in which God communicates to us. That is what biblical interpretation is all about. Accurate biblical interpretation will recognize that God is spirit (John 4:24) and not a bird having feathers and wings (Psalm 91:4). Accurate biblical interpretation will recognize Jesus Christ as true man and true God not an actual lion or lamb (Revelation 5:5-6). Similarly, accurate biblical interpretation will recognize how God describes our world in figurative ways.\nHuman beings are the crown of God\u2019s creation in that God made all things and then made people in his image (Genesis 1:26-27) to rule over and care for his creation (Genesis 1:28; 2:15).\nIt is creation itself (Psalm 19:1) that attests to the existence of God, along with our conscience (Romans 2:15) and God\u2019s word (Exodus 3:14). God be praised for his creation\u2014and for coming to the rescue of his fallen creation through Jesus Christ his Son."}

People cannot bring themselves to faith in Jesus because they are powerless to do so (Ephesians 2:1), they are naturally blind to the truths of salvation (2 Corinthians 4:4-6), and they have no desire to come to faith in Jesus because of their natural animosity toward God (Romans 8:7).\nWhat was true regarding Jesus\u2019 disciples is true of every child of God: \u201cYou did not choose me, but I chose you\u2026\u201d (John 15:16). Thank God for the gift of Christian faith!"}
{"prompt": "Witnessing to an atheist friend", "completion": "I have an atheist friend who asserts that the Bible cannot be the perfect and unerring Word of God, and who, to demonstrate this, cites Deuteronomy 17 (verses 2-5) which commands that the wicked who worship false gods must be stoned to death.  She also cites Hosea 13:16 and Hosea 9:14.  I think, by taking the Hosea verses out of their context, she is not understanding the nature of that story and what it is illustrating, but I don't know what to say to her about the Deuteronomy reference.  She thinks the Hosea verses are contrary to our pro-life stance. How should I explain this to her?\n\n\nWhen it comes to the disastrous conditions of Hosea 9 and 16, the people of Israel were reaping the fruits of their idolatrous ways of life. God had promised temporal blessings if the people followed his commands (Deuteronomy 28:1-14). Additionally, God had threatened to make the people\u2019s lives miserable if they did not follow his commands (Deuteronomy 28:15-68). By deserting the Lord and chasing after false gods, the people were suffering self-inflicted disasters. To me, this is evidence that God\u2019s word is \u201cperfect and unerring.\u201d There were no surprises in what was happening in the lives of the people of Israel described in Hosea. God laid out an offer of life and death (Deuteronomy 30:11-20), and the people chose death.\nThe command in Deuteronomy 17 to execute idolaters ties in with the previous information. If problems were going to result from idolatry, then idolatry needed to be checked. That truth is even more apparent when we consider that the greatest problem people could have experienced was eternal death, eternal separation from God in hell.\nIf there are objections to the provision of stoning idolaters in Old Testament Israel to death, people need to keep in mind what God says, \u201cSee now that I myself am he! There is no god besides me. I put to death and I bring to life\u201d (Deuteronomy 32:39). As the giver of life, God is the one who has the right to end life. He still authorizes governments today to act in his behalf when it comes to punishing criminals (cf. Romans 13)\nGod bless your witnessing efforts to your friend. Keeping directing her to God\u2019s law which points out sin and the need for a Savior from sin (Romans 3:20). Keep pointing her to God\u2019s gospel which speaks of God\u2019s forgiving love in Christ (John 3:16)."}
{"prompt": "Catholic or catholic?", "completion": "I have been to weddings and baptisms in Lutheran churches outside of WELS in which they confess their faith during the Creed in the Holy Catholic Church, instead of saying the Holy Christian Church like we do.  Why would a Lutheran church confess the Holy Catholic Church?\n\n\nFor starters, it would be good to review the difference between \u201ccatholic\u201d and \u201cCatholic.\u201d The former means \u201cuniversal,\u201d while the latter refers to a church body, the Roman Catholic Church.\nThere is a \u201ccatholic\u201d or \u201cuniversal\u201d church of which the Bible speaks (1 Corinthians 3:16; Ephesians 1:23; 4:4, 12). There is a \u201ccatholic\u201d or \u201cuniversal\u201d faith of which the Bible speaks (Ephesians 4:5). That faith is centered in Jesus Christ as Savior.\nWhen WELS congregations used The Lutheran Hymnal (1941), worshipers confessed in the Athanasian Creed: \u201cWhosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that he hold the catholic [i.e., universal, Christian] faith.\u201d Christian Worship:\u00a0 A Lutheran Hymnal (1993) eliminated potential confusion with that terminology by recasting the opening line of that creed this way: \u201cWhoever wishes to be saved must, above all else, hold to the true Christian faith.\u201d\nWith these things in mind, a Lutheran church can confess belief in the \u201choly catholic church\u201d but not the \u201choly Catholic church.\u201d"}

How can you put this passage in perspective of when you pray for a specific thing that is not happening or will not happen, such as healing of a serious or terminal illness?\n\n\nWhat we need to do is take that promise of answered prayer in Mark 11 and keep it in the context of what God says elsewhere in Scripture about prayer.\nWhen it comes to praying about our physical health and other bodily needs, we pray with the attitude of \u201cyour will be done\u201d (Matthew 6:10; James 4:13-15).

{"prompt": "Old Testament believers and heaven", "completion": "Is there, and where is it, a Bible passage that specifically states that Abraham (or Isaac, Jacob, Moses, etc.) went to heaven?  Like - \"and God took Abraham to heaven\"?\n\n\nRather than using those precise words, the Bible states that a person like Abraham \u201cwas gathered to his people\u201d (Genesis 25:8). Still, it is very clear what happened to Old Testament believers like Abraham when they died. The writer to the Hebrews included Abraham when he wrote: \u201cAll these people were still living by faith when they died. They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance, admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on earth. People who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own. If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had opportunity to return. Instead, they were longing for a better country\u2014a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them \u201c (Hebrews 11:13-16).\nThe Bible does use the terminology you referenced when it comes to Elijah and his fiery exit from this world: \u201cWhen the LORD was about to take Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal\u2026 As they were walking along and talking together, suddenly a chariot of fire and horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them, and Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind\u201d (2 Kings 2:1, 11).\nOld Testament and New Testament believers form that group that the apostle John saw in one of the visions God gave him (Revelation 7:1-8).

{"prompt": "Lazarus and heaven", "completion": "Someone asked me this question the other day and I didn't know how to answer them.  The question is: \"What happened to Lazarus' soul while he was in the grave?  Did he experience heaven during the time that his body was in the grave?  Would he then have had the opportunity to share his glimpse of heaven with those he knew after he was raised from the dead?\" I told them that Scripture doesn't give us any specific information on this event, but maybe there are other passages of Scripture that can help explain the question.  \n\n\nAs with any other human being, the body and soul of Lazarus separated when he died (Ecclesiastes 12;7). His soul went to heaven, while his body remained on earth. His soul remained in heaven while his body was in the tomb.\nResurrection is the reuniting of body and soul. That happened when Jesus summoned Lazarus to come out of the tomb (John 11:43).\nDid Lazarus have memories of his short time in heaven, and did he share those memories with his family and friends? It is an interesting question, but it is one the Bible does not answer.\nWhen it comes to Lazarus and other people who were raised from the dead in Old and New Testament times, the narratives in the Bible underscore the love and power of God and do not touch on the experiences of those involved."}
{"prompt": "Marrying an unbeliever", "completion": "Is marrying an unbeliever wrong? Or is it just foolish?\n\n\nIt is not wrong in that it is sinful. Sometimes people point to 2 Corinthians 6:14 (\u201cDo not be yoked together with unbelievers.\u201d) as God\u2019s prohibition of marriage between a Christian and a non-Christian. The context, however, is not about marriage. Without condemnation of any kind, 1 Peter 3:1-2 addresses Christian women who are married to unbelieving men.\nRather than labeling such a marriage as \u201cfoolish,\u201d I would say that a marriage between a Christian and a non-Christian is going to be set up for many challenges.

If the Christian spouse is not going to compromise the faith, he or she will need to face the fact that the unbelieving spouse will spend eternity in a different place, unless God the Holy Spirit changes the spouse\u2019s heart.\nThat lack of unity in the faith can pose problems when it comes to devoting time to worshiping the Lord in church, giving back part of one\u2019s income to the Lord, deciding how to raise children spiritually\u2014just to name a few issues.\nOn the other hand, what a great blessing there is when a man and a woman can be \u201cone\u201d in marriage in the most important way: when they are fellow members of the family of God. Such a marriage is not exempt from problems, but it has a wonderful foundation because it is built on the love of God in Christ."}
{"prompt": "Faith and regeneration", "completion": "Does faith precede regeneration?\n\n\nNo. Regeneration is a term for the work of the Holy Spirit whereby he brings people to saving faith in Jesus Christ.\nThe Bible explains that all people are spiritually dead by nature (Ephesians 2:1). Regeneration describes the work of the Holy Spirit in giving new life\u2014faith\u2014to people who were spiritually dead (Ephesians 2:4-5.) Regeneration speaks of being born again (John 3:3-6; 1 Peter 1:23)."}
{"prompt": "God and the origin of sin", "completion": "If God knew mankind would sin, wasn't he setting mankind up for failure by placing the tree in the garden? Couldn't God have made mankind without sin since he is perfect? If God created everything, didn't he also create sin?\n\n\nGod certainly could have prevented sin from corrupting his creation, but he does not reveal in the Bible why he did not choose that course of action. What God did reveal in Scripture is the following:\nGod created everything, and at the end of the sixth day of creation he pronounced everything \u201cvery good\u201d (Genesis 1:31). All was perfect in God\u2019s creation. Sin was absent. At some point thereafter angels rebelled against God and were cast into hell (2 Peter 2:4). Through Satan\u2019s temptation in the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve sinned against God (Genesis 3). Sin clearly came into the world through people\u2019s actions (Romans 5:12). God is removed from wrongdoing of any kind; he is holy (James 1:13; Exodus 15:11; Isaiah 6:3). God certainly knew that sin would infect and corrupt his creation. In eternity he formulated his plan to rescue the world (Revelation 13:8), and in time he carried out his plan in the person of his Son Jesus Christ.\nWhen it comes to our questions of God that the Bible does not answer, we do best to adopt the attitude of the apostle Paul: \u201cOh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out! \u2018Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?\u2019 \u2018Who has ever given to God, that God should repay them?\u2019 For from him and through him and for him are all things. To him be the glory forever! Amen.\u201d (Romans 11:33-36)"}
{"prompt": "Religious wars", "completion": "Should religious war--past, present, and future--be regretted as a lamentable consequence of sin, or is it a necessary evil? How should I answer to someone who considers the church's violent history a stumbling block? I have been talking with some non-Christian friends about our beliefs, and they cite the entry to Canaan, the Crusades, and the post-Reformation religious wars as reasons to not follow God. They say that Christianity cannot be a \"religion of peace\" when so many have waged war in God's name. Contrarily, some of my Christian friends argue religious war is necessary, especially given the current times.\r\nMy readings about the Crusades and the post-Reformation wars do not agree on the primary motivations (religion, politics, or a mix of both), so it's hard to refute them, and simply glossing them over or \"letting bygones be bygones\" doesn't satisfy any of us. The Bible seems conflicted about the nature of religious war; in the Old Testament it was justified and commanded by God, but the New Testament is less condoning. What should I tell them?\n\n\n\u201cThe entry to Canaan\u201d is in a category of war all by itself. God explained to Moses (Deuteronomy 20) and Joshua (Joshua 1) that the Israelites were to conquer the land that God had promised to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (Deuteronomy 34). God is free to do as he pleases (Psalm 115:3). Whatever God does is right (Deuteronomy 32:4).\nGod is a just judge. On the last day he will sentence unbelievers, body and soul, to hell (Matthew 25:41-46). As a just judge, God can carry out judgment against unbelievers in this life, as he did with the heathen people who were inhabiting the land of Canaan.\nThe Crusades are in an entirely different category. Pope Urban II called for a crusade in 1095 A.D. in response to a call for help from the emperor of the Byzantine Empire. The stated reason for help was that holy places in the land of Israel had fallen into the hands of Muslims who were also threatening to invade the Byzantine Empire. Unfortunately, the Crusades provided opportunities for many wrong attitudes and actions: work righteousness, power grabs, greed, the merciless slaughter of Muslims, Jews and others whom the church deemed to be heretics\u2014just to list a few.\nThe Crusades and other religious wars involving Christians are regrettable. Understandably, they do not provide others with an attraction to the Christian faith and life. What they do furnish are opportunities for Christians today to explain to others that the Christian Church has always consisted of sinful people, but people who stand holy and blameless in the sight of God through the faith he gave them in the Savior who lived and died for them.\nWhile God has given governments the authority to wage wars to defend their citizens (Romans 13), he instructs his people to love their enemies (Matthew 5:44) and live at peace with others as best they can (Romans 12:18). God has given governments authority to protect their people from their enemies. God has given his Church the mandate to proclaim his saving word to people who are his natural enemies because of sin and unbelief."}

Among them is the phenomenon that his workings were already beginning to take form at the time of the apostles and yet would continue to exist until exposed and condemned by the Lord Jesus at Christ\u2019s second coming (2 Thessalonians 2:7-8). That kind of description best fits an enduring institution.\n\u201cAlso, in similar as well as parallel apocalyptic prophecies, the pictures of individual animals (beasts) and people are used to denote empires or political as well as religious systems.

The reason I'm asking is because I know that Lutherans have a different  belief on baptism and how it works.\n\n\nThere would not be a need to be baptized again. While Baptist theology misunderstands the purpose and blessings of baptism, the baptism of such churches is a valid baptism. Water is applied in the name of the Triune God: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. That constitutes a valid baptism.\nWhat would be necessary to join one of our congregations is to attend and complete a course of Bible information classes.

{"prompt": "Request for funeral service", "completion": "My mother-in-law recently passed at the age of 85 and had not been a member of a church for some time.  When I called one of our churches and spoke with the pastor and asked him if he could do the service for us, he told me he did not feel comfortable with that since he did not know her.  (I had called another church earlier and was told the same thing.)  So I had said to the pastor, \"This is so disappointing, I thought we are all God's children and I was just looking for someone to bless her.\"  His reply to that was, \"I could say some very blunt things to you right now that would hurt your feelings, but I don't want to do that and hurt your feelings anymore than they are already.\"  What pastor would say something like this to someone grieving at the loss of a loved one? \n\n\nFirst, let me express my sympathy to you and your family upon the death of your mother-in-law. Death was an intruder into God\u2019s perfect world, but thanks be to God that Jesus Christ has conquered death and shares his victory with all who are joined to him in faith (John 11:25-26).\nOur pastors generally officiate at the funerals of church members and also non-members from whom they received a confession of faith during their ministry to them. When one of our pastors receives a request to officiate at the funeral of a person who did not desire the ministry of the church during life, it certainly seems to be consistent with the wishes of that person not to receive the ministry of the church when life on earth comes to an end.\nPastors conducting funeral services in our churches do not \u201cbless\u201d the deceased. Our pastors minister to the needs of surviving family and friends. If a pastor is not able to officiate at the funeral of someone who was not affiliated with his church or from whom he did not receive a confession of faith, there are ways in which he can minister to the needs of survivors outside a funeral service.\nA Christian funeral service is a worship service conducted by the pastor of that congregation. As such, the content of the funeral service reflects the faith that the church teaches and the members profess\u2014especially by their affiliation with the congregation.\nThrough their calls, our pastors serve as representatives of their congregations. The actions they take reflect on the congregations they serve. Through the decisions that they make regarding funeral service requests, our pastors seek to give the clearest testimony to others of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Through their words and actions, they want others to know that there is salvation only through Jesus Christ (Acts 4:12) and that acknowledging Jesus Christ as Savior is vitally important (Matthew 10:32).\nHuman beings are God\u2019s children in the sense that they received life from him (Acts 17:28-29), but Christians are adopted members of God\u2019s family who enjoy his forgiving love now and forever (John 1:12-13; Galatians 4:4-5).\nAs I was not privy to the conversation you had with one of our pastors, I am not able to address the details of it.\u00a0 I would simply encourage you to contact him so that this matter can be resolved peaceably. God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Martin Luther and the Bible", "completion": "Why was Martin Luther against so many of the books that are in the Catholic Bible, and some that remain in ours also?\r\nFrom what I have researched, he tried to get rid of some of the books we currently have, including Hebrews, James, and Revelation (and the seven Old Testament books he was successful with). He also said that \"the epistle of St. James is an epistle full of straw.\" (He seemed to really dislike James' writings). \r\nWhy did the Protestant Bible throw away so many books, ones it had before the Reformation?\n\n\nLike other church leaders, Martin Luther had opinions about books of the Bible and writings that were purported to be canonical. From the start, I need to emphasize that we, as confessional Lutheran Christians, do not base any of our teachings on the opinions of Martin Luther. We recognize that he was a highly gifted individual whom God used, along with others, at a critical time in history to restore the truths of his word. Luther\u2019s writings, however, are not the foundation of our faith. Scripture alone is.\nThat being said, Luther did have opinions\u2014strong ones sometimes\u2014on what constituted the canon. (In that regard, let me emphasize that the church did not establish the canon. God did.) Luther\u2019s early views on the book of James are understandable: the emphasis on good works seemed to be supportive of the Roman Catholic Church\u2019s teaching of work righteousness against which he was opposed.\nAs time went on, he softened his views on James. Luther\u2019s introductory remarks to the book of Romans illustrate an understanding of what the book of James stresses: \u201cOh, a living, energetic, active, mighty thing is this faith. It is impossible for it not to do good incessantly. Nor does it ask whether good works are to be done; but before the question is put, it has already done them and is forever doing them\u2026Faith is a living, daring confidence in the grace of God. It is so certain that a man would die for it a thousand times over. This confidence and knowledge of divine grace makes a person happy, bold and of high spirits in his relation to God and all His creatures. The Holy Spirit creates this attitude in faith. Hence a person, without constraint, becomes willing and eager to do good to everybody, to serve everybody, to suffer all sorts of things for the love of God and to the praise of Him who has shown him such grace. So it is impossible to separate works from faith, indeed just as impossible as it is to separate heat and light from fire.\u201d [What Luther Says, Volume I, pages 498-499]\nWhile Luther did have questions and reservations about books like Hebrews, James, Jude and Revelation, he included them in his translation of the Bible. (Incidentally, he also included the Apocrypha in his translation. He did so with the notation that those books were not to be considered equal with other books of the Bible, but they were useful for reading.)\nThe \u201cProtestant Bible\u201d did not throw away books that it had before the Reformation. By the time of Jesus, the books of the Old Testament were recognized as God\u2019s word. Jesus himself spoke of the threefold division of Old Testament books: \u201cthe Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms\u201d (Luke 24:44). After about three centuries, there was general consensus in the church that the New Testament books of the Bible were those written by Jesus\u2019 apostles or their acquaintances (Ephesians 2:20). The discussions and debates in the church though did not establish the New Testament canon. God did.\nIf you are interested in reading more on this topic, this link will provide you with many articles."}
{"prompt": "Sin and fruits of repentance", "completion": "Is our salvation in jeopardy if we do not make right an issue we have an opportunity to correct? I am struggling with whether or not I am truly forgiven for some things. I do believe in Christ's redemptive work on the cross and I am truly sorry for all my sins including the ones that I don't even know about. For example, let's say I have stolen something from someone and I am truly sorry for having done so. Do I need to give back in order to truly be forgiven?\n\n\nYour question addresses the topic of fruits of repentance (Matthew 3:8; Luke 3:8). Such fruits are tangible evidence of what is professed to be in the heart. With that in mind, when a person confesses sins to God, outward actions will line up with that confession. Something is wrong when that is not the case.\nLet me give an example. Suppose I rob a bank, tell God, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d but then keep the money. What are you led to think about my repentance? It looks like my repentance is superficial, doesn\u2019t it? It looks like my repentance consists simply of words that lack meaning. If I am sorry for the wrong I have committed, I will take actions that are appropriate to the sin. In that case, I would need to return the money and face the earthly consequences of my sin. Any earthly consequences would not negate God\u2019s forgiveness.\nSalvation is in jeopardy when people simply go through the motions of Christianity. Jesus spoke of that in the sermon on the mount (Matthew 7:21-23).\nYour faith is rightly centered in Jesus Christ. He lived and died in your place. He rose from the dead to guarantee your salvation (Romans 4:25). Keep looking to him for your complete forgiveness of sins. When you do not follow God\u2019s will, confess that to the Lord and receive the news of his forgiveness in faith (1 John 1:9). As a fruit of repentance, restore\u2014if possible\u2014whatever sin has ruined. God bless you!"}
{"prompt": "The fruit of the Spirit", "completion": "When referring to the fruit of the Spirit, do we use fruit in a singular or plural form? In other words, does it matter if we say that the fruit of the Spirit is one fruit with the attributes of  love, joy, peace or if we say each attribute is a fruit of the Spirit? \n\n\nWe use it in a singular form. \u201cThe fruit of the Spirit\u201d (Galatians 5:22) is an accurate translation of the original Greek. \u201cFruit\u201d is a collective noun that describes the parts it encompasses.\nIt does not matter how you describe the relationship of the attributes to the fruit. \u201cThe fruit of the Spirit\u201d is what the Holy Spirit works in people through the gospel in word and sacraments. The fruit that the Holy Spirit brings about in the lives of Christians is \u201clove, joy, peace, forbearance [patience], kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.\u201d\nHow different that \u201cfruit\u201d is from the \u201cacts of the flesh\u201d (Galatians 5:19-21). The attitudes and actions that the Holy Spirit brings about in us are far, far different from what our sinful nature produces. Through contrition and repentance we seek to control the acts of the sinful flesh, and through the gospel in word and sacraments we receive the fruit that the Holy Spirit bestows."}
{"prompt": "Understanding life's events", "completion": "Is it dangerous to treat coincidences as omens from God? I believe that God has a hand in every aspect of our life. If this is true, wouldn't it be safe to say that some coincidences, be it positive or negative, are God's ways of talking to us? Is it feasible that he uses coincidences to point us down a personal path he has picked out for us? If you say that this is feasible, then what happens if it swings the other way? Maybe something works out in our favor that is truly just a coincidence, but we interpret it as an omen from God and follow a path that brings negativity into our life. Interpreting coincidences seems like something that is very subjective, yet I constantly hear people saying, \"That was just God looking out for me,\" as they dodge something negative in their life. \r\n\r\nOr does WELS believe that God's only channel of communication to us is through the Bible?\r\nI understand that we should always  use what God has given us in Scripture to align our lives with his will. How do we answer questions that aren't about moral complications though? Is this where we may allow God's \"omens\" to help guide our decisions?\n\n\nThe starting point in my response is the acknowledgement that God communicates to us through his word (1 Corinthians 2:13; 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Timothy 3:16-17; 2 Peter 1:21). Through his word God has revealed plainly his law and gospel.\nI can probably best address the multiple questions you asked about coincidences by steering you to the topic of \u201cGod\u2019s providence.\u201d Beyond the great gift of life that God has given us, he protects and preserves us. He uses different means and events in life to carry out his good and gracious will. While we may not be able to understand or interpret life\u2019s events, we do know that God has promised to work for our eventual and eternal good in all those events (Romans 8:28).\nWas it a case of \u201cGod looking out for me\u201d when people dodged a negative in life? Sure. Was it also a case of \u201cGod looking out for me\u201d when people were not able to dodge a negative in life? Yes. The wisdom and love of God make it possible to answer that question in the affirmative (Genesis 50:20).\nThat general way of looking at life\u2019s events can provide a quiet contentment and confidence in life. If you and I try to interpret every one of life\u2019s events with an eye toward determining God\u2019s will, we will find that to be a frustrating experience. God\u2019s ways are beyond our ways (Isaiah 55:8). There is plenty of information about God that is hidden from us (Isaiah 45:15). In addition, when it comes to making decisions that concern our earthly lives, God has enabled us to work in the sphere of limited freedom.\nWith these things in mind, you and I go through life seeking, with God\u2019s help and strength, to give him glory in all we do, including the decisions we make (1 Corinthians 10:31)."}
{"prompt": "The public ministry and the Bible", "completion": "From what I have heard regarding the office of the holy ministry, the three distinctive functions of the ministry are preaching, administering sacraments, and exercising the Office of the Keys. Is this correct? If so, could you explain where in the Bible these three functions are described as exclusive to the ministry? Thank you.\n\n\nThe Shepherd Under Christ, a textbook for practical theology, addresses your questions well. It explains, from Scripture, to our seminary students how the public ministry relates to the universal priesthood of believers.\n\u201cGod has given the gospel to all Christians, individually and collectively. Jesus entrusted to each Christian and to groups of Christians gathered about the gospel the right to bind or loose, to forgive or retain sins, by declaring or withholding His gospel (Mt 18:18; Jn 20:21-23). Every Christian as a member of the royal priesthood has been called to proclaim the Lord\u2019s praises (1 Pe 2:9). He is called to function as a witness and servant of His Lord, as a light to the world (Mt 5:16). He has this call as a member of the universal priesthood of all believers. This is the ministry that Christ has enjoined on His New Testament church and that has been committed to every Christian (Mt 28:18-20; Mk 16:15).\n\u201cThe Lord has also established the public ministry in His church. This ministry does not set up a priestly caste apart from the laity, for, as noted above, all Christians are priests of God. The difference lies in the word public. The public ministry is a service performed in the church, in behalf of fellow Christians, in their name. Like the public official in a state who functions in the name of his fellow citizens that have elected him, so the minister has an office in which he carries out responsibilities that have been entrusted to him by fellow Christians. These responsibilities are not essentially different from those Christ committed to every Christian. The minister too is to serve in the gospel as did Paul and Timothy (Ph 2:19-23); to labor in the Word and doctrine (1 Tm 5:17); to speak the Word of God (He 11:17). But the minister does this in the church, in behalf of the church, and as a representative of the church.\n\u201cWhile every Christian has the call to proclaim Christ to the world, for the public ministry, and this includes the pastoral office, a specific call is necessary. Within the church every Christian, being a priest of God, possesses the ministry in equal measure. Good order, therefore, requires that no one function publicly, that is, in behalf of the assembly of Christians, unless these Christians themselves by means of a call have commissioned him to do so (1 Cor 14:40; Ro 10:15; 1 Pe 4:15).

{"prompt": "Jacob wrestling with God", "completion": "When Jacob wrestled with God in Genesis 32, he demanded that God would bless him. Can we also demand a blessing from God?\n\n\nDemand has the idea of \u201casking authoritatively.\u201d The shading of that word would rule out our demanding that God answer our prayers the way we want. We are not in a position to tell God what to do. God is the Creator. We are his creation (Psalm 100:3).\nStill, God invites us to pray to him boldly and persistently (Luke 18:1-8). But we balance that invitation with the recognition that God knows what is best for us (2 Corinthians 12:7-9).\nThe account of Jacob wrestling with the Lord is certainly a fascinating one. It shows us how the Lord condescended and entered the life of Jacob physically for his good. The account shows us how the all-powerful Lord made himself \u201cweak\u201d so that one of his children could prevail.\nA takeaway from that account, again, is an encouragement for you and me to come to God boldly and persistently in prayer\u2014laying before him our \u201cpetitions, prayers and intercession\u201d (1 Timothy 2:1), knowing and believing that he will answer them according to his wisdom and love.\nMartin Luther\u2019s memorable explanation of the address of the Lord\u2019s Prayer summarizes well these thoughts: \u201cWith these words God tenderly invites us to believe that he is our true Father and that we are his true children, so that we may pray to him as boldly and confidently as dear children ask their dear father.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Casting lots", "completion": "Can Christians \"cast lots\" or flip a coin to determine the will of God or what God wants us to do? Proverbs 16:33 and Acts 1:23-26 seem to speak favorably of this. However, would such a practice be \"putting the Lord your God to the test\"?\n\n\nIn Leviticus 16:8 God gave Moses instructions on how the high priest was to cast lots to identify the scapegoat sent into the desert on the great Day of Atonement. Beyond that, there are relatively few instances in the Bible of people casting lots. Those instances relate what people did; they do not carry with them the command to do likewise. In addition, God has not promised to reveal his will through that practice.\nGod has revealed his will to us in the pages of the Bible. He gives us freedom to make decisions in life that concern our earthly lives. When we prayerfully consider what decisions will glorify God and reflect his revealed will in Scripture, we can choose courses of action with Christian confidence and contentment."}
{"prompt": "Head coverings in Corinth", "completion": "Regarding head coverings in 1 Corinthians 11:  are Christian women supposed to cover their heads when they worship/pray?  Is it a sin not to?\r\nWhy did we stop this practice? It seems clear that Paul is referring to a head covering on top of long hair (long hair is not a substitute for a covering).\r\nIt also does not seem to be a cultural thing, since Roman women in Corinth did not cover their heads. (It was a Christian thing.)\r\nVerse 16 says, \"If anyone wants to be contentious [argue] about this, we have no other practice - nor do the churches of God.\" Does this not mean that God's true church partakes in this head covering practice? And that if Corinth did not do this also, they were not a part of the true church?\r\nI am scared to pray/worship now, since I do not want to sin deliberately.\r\n \r\n\r\n\n\n\nYou do not need to worry about praying and worshiping with your head uncovered. In 1 Corinthians 11:16, a verse you cited, the apostle Paul identifies the head coverings of the Christian women in Corinth as a \u201cpractice\u201d or custom. A local practice or custom is far different from a universal principle from God, binding all women of all time to do the same. Because the Bible limits the instruction of head coverings to the women of Corinth in the first century by calling this a \u201cpractice,\u201d women of other places and times are not bound to that instruction.\nWhat was going on in Corinth? In the everyday, pagan culture of Corinth, women had head coverings (and you notice from the footnote in the NIV that such coverings could have been long hair in general or actual coverings to the head), recognizing by nature what God says in his Word\u2014that men and women have distinctive callings in life as head and helper. The directive in 1 Corinthians 11 was that the Christian women in Corinth not to be social renegades, but living examples of biblical principles regarding men and women (1 Corinthians 11:3). By mirroring cultural practices that were occasioned by the natural knowledge of God and conscience, the Christian women of Corinth could reinforce that knowledge and display their faith so others could be positively influenced (Matthew 5:16).\nI encourage you to recognize the Christian freedom you have when it comes to praying to God and worshiping him, and then exercise it with a clear conscience."}

{"prompt": "Online ordination to officiate at wedding", "completion": "A close friend of mine and fellow churchgoer (WELS) recently shared with me her intentions to become an ordained minister (online) so she could marry her brother at their wedding.  As her brother and bride-to-be have no church affiliation, she thought this would be a way to minister to them while marrying them legally.  Her brother has rallied behind this plan.  My friend is a good person and attends church regularly, but has had no formal theological education beyond eighth grade confirmation.\r\n\r\nWhen I was not supportive of this, she asked why.  I told her online ordination is simply a transaction that may give one legal status to marry, but is offensive to God and His Church; to say nothing of \u201creal\u201d ordained ministers who are called by the Holy Spirit and have studied rigorously to attain this status.  I also advised her that, as a WELS member, she would likely not be welcome to continue in our fellowship if she becomes an ordained minister within another church body \u2013 most especially true as Scripture is clear that women are not to be ordained, period, WELS or not.\r\n\r\nI am struggling to answer her convictions that there is no scriptural/doctrinal problem here.  I don\u2019t want her to disgrace the ministry of the Gospel or bring unintended consequences to her spiritual well-being.  She has rebuffed my suggestions of speaking to our pastor, saying it\u2019s not about religion, it\u2019s just about performing this ceremony for her brother.  Can you provide some guidance in this situation?  Thank you and blessings to you all.\n\n\nSince governments regulate marriage, governments also stipulate who can\u2014as agents of the government\u2014officiate at weddings. Regulations vary from state to state. Ordination is not always a requirement.\nIt does look like you gave your friend accurate information. You could simply supply the scriptural support for why women are not to be ordained clergy: 1 Corinthians 11:3; 14:33-35; 1 Timothy 2:11-12.\nYour friend stated to you that she wishes to officiate at her brother\u2019s wedding because of a desire to \u201cminister\u201d to her unchurched brother and fianc\u00e9e. While that might be a noble goal, a pastor would be in a much better position to minister to a couple like that by offering biblical pre-marital counseling and then officiating at their wedding.\nI wish you well in your conversations with your friend and pray for God\u2019s blessings on them."}
{"prompt": "Need to confess sins to a pastor?", "completion": "Do you have to confess your sins out loud to a pastor to be forgiven?\r\n(Even if the sin is humiliating?)\n\n\nNo. Private confession of sins to one\u2019s pastor is optional but not mandatory. What is important is confessing one\u2019s sins to God (Matthew 6:12).\nThe Bible\u2019s wonderful message is that \u201ca broken and contrite heart you, God, will not despise\u201d (Psalm 51:17). \u201cIf we confess our sins, [God] is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness\u201d (1 John 1:9)."}
{"prompt": "Why not every Sunday Communion?", "completion": "Why is Holy Communion not offered every week at worship service?\n\n\nIt is in some of our congregations. Each congregation has Christian freedom to determine the number of worship services it will hold, on which days of the week those services will take place and how often the Lord\u2019s Supper will be offered.\nThe Bible speaks of the frequency of receiving the Lord\u2019s Supper in general terms (1 Corinthians 11:25-26), leaving the specifics to Christians and their New Testament freedom.\nWhatever decisions congregations reach regarding their worship service schedules, we can be confident God is feeding the souls of his people through his gospel in word and sacrament."}
{"prompt": "Baptism and original sin", "completion": "My question is about original sin and baptism:\r\n\r\nIn looking over sections of the Book of Concord, I understand Lutherans oppose the Catholic Church\u2019s teaching of concupiscence.  \r\n\r\nAs a lifelong Lutheran I have always believed that in Baptism all our sins have been forgiven and that in faith with a contrite heart we continuously live in our baptism dying daily to sin and we believe forgiveness of sin (reconciliation) is an extension of baptism. My curiosity got to me when I came across the concept of concupiscence as quoted in the Book of Concord so I had to look it up from a Catholic perspective. Reflecting on this, it brings up a question that sort of troubles me: why don\u2019t we as Lutherans believe that original sin, like the sins of omission and commission, can be removed through the waters of baptism?  Lutherans seem to use the term \u201csinful nature\u201d interchangeably with \u201coriginal sin\u201d and I understand this can be seen as a loss of grace of original holiness which results in man being subject to the law of death as a result of Adam\u2019s fall. From what I have always understood (and from the Lutheran perspective) in this life we who die in the Lord can never shed our old Adam, sinful nature, or original sin until we depart from this world. For me, thinking about baptism as a covenant, it feels like our confessions would then imply original sin (the devil who had a hand in this original curse) still clings to us through these waters and never gets fully washed off at the time we go through the waters which in turn leaves me unsettled feeling. \r\n\r\nFrom a confessional Lutheran standpoint, could you please explain? In particular, through the lens of what this means at the time of baptism?    \n\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church errs in a couple of directions when it comes to its teaching of baptism. On the one hand, it teaches that baptism offers a limited forgiveness of sins in that it forgives only sins committed before baptism; sins committed after baptism are dealt with by means of some of their other sacraments, including penance. On the other hand, the Roman Catholic Church teaches that baptism removes original sin to the degree that what remains (concupiscence) is not sinful.\nLutherans believe and teach that baptism forgives the guilt of original sin, but the sinful nature that remains is real sin. As you noted, the sinful nature is part of us throughout this earthly life and continually wars with the new self (Romans 7:7-25).\nBaptism does free us from the power of the devil (Hebrews 2:14-15). Still, the devil seeks to attack us and rob us of our saving faith (1 Peter 5:8). Baptism is a daily reminder that we are God\u2019s children (1 Corinthians 6:11; Galatians 3:26-27).\nWhen it comes to the importance of baptism, Article II of the Augsburg Confession states: \u201cAlso they [our churches] teach that since the fall of Adam, all men begotten in the natural way are born with sin, that is, without the fear of God, without trust in God, and with concupiscence; and that this disease, or vice of origin, is truly sin, even now condemning and bringing eternal death upon those not born again through Baptism and the Holy Ghost.\u201d This is what we believe and teach on the basis of Scripture."}
{"prompt": "Any connection between sin and illness?", "completion": "A Christian friend is trying to tell me my son is being punished with severe illness (or his recovery is being hampered) because of things he believes I've done in the past, specifically he believes I have not forgiven some people in my past who hurt me.  There are so many conflicting Scripture passages about children being punished for sins of their parents.  What is WELS teaching?\n\n\nIn the Old Testament Job had some friends who tried helping him by explaining the source of the difficulties he was experiencing in life. Their \u201cinsight\u201d was not helpful because they were misrepresenting God by telling Job that God was punishing him for past sins.\nJob\u2019s friends were not the only people wrongly to connect the dots between earthly problems and sin. One day during Jesus\u2019 ministry, the Lord and his disciples came upon a man who, from birth, had no eyesight. Jesus\u2019 disciples asked: \u201cRabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?\u201d The Lord answered: \u201cNeither this man nor his parents sinned, but this happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him\u201d (John 9:2-3).\nJob\u2019s friends and Jesus\u2019 disciples needed to understand how God does and does not operate. God does not punish his children for their sins. He has already punished his Son Jesus in their place. Might the Lord chastise or discipline Christians? Yes, but the motive is entirely different from punishment. When God disciplines, he acts out of love and for the good of his children (Hebrews 12:7-11).\nGod\u2019s words about \u201cpunishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation\u201d (Exodus 20:5) refer to people outside the faith. When there is persistent unbelief from one generation to the next, God can certainly bring down judgment on people in this life for their sins.\nI take it that your friend\u2019s assertion that you have failed to forgive others is unfounded. Considering that, I would encourage you to ignore his interpretation of your son\u2019s illness. God bless you and your family."}
{"prompt": "Books and podcasts", "completion": "Is the book \"Radical Christianity\" by David Platt doctrinally sound? \r\nIs the book \"Crazy Love\" by Francis Chan doctrinally sound? \r\nIf not, based on Romans 16:17, would you recommend avoiding the teachings, via books and podcasts, of these two men?\n\n\nI am not in a position to offer detailed comments on these particular books. The Reformed backgrounds of both authors serve as a warning to read their works critically.\nIn general, I can say that Romans 16:17 would not prevent us from reading books that are not doctrinally sound. Knowing the doctrinal errors of other churches or individuals\u2014through personal reading of their materials\u2014can be beneficial and helpful in our witnessing efforts to others.\nCertainly, as you read religious material, or watch or listen to religious programming, you want to \u201ctest the spirits\u201d (1 John 4:1). You want to follow the example of the Bereans (Act 17:10-15) who compared what they heard with Scripture.\nWhile we can read or use many different kinds of materials to grow in our understanding of biblical truth and error, I would not encourage you to keep exposing yourself to a steady diet of false doctrine in your reading or podcast listening. There is so much good content that can occupy our attention. God guide and bless you!"}
{"prompt": "Meaning of 1 Corinthians 15:29", "completion": "What does 1 Corinthians 15:29 mean?\n\n\nIf you were to read the commentary on this verse in The People\u2019s Bible (1 Corinthians, pages 149-150), you would find this: \u201cOur first impression is that early Christians practiced vicarious baptism; one person could be baptized for another and thus could transfer his salvation to another. But the Bible clearly teaches that each person is saved by his own baptism and by his own faith. A God-fearing mother cannot believe or be baptized for a godless son.\n\u201cIf it was not a vicarious baptism that Paul had in mind, then what was the practice he was referring to? More than three hundred different interpretations of this passage have been offered. Several of the interpretations that put the best construction on the practice are: 1) The relative of a Christian who has died may wish to be baptized in order to see this Christian again; 2) He may want to express the hope that a Christian friend who had died will rise; 3) The baptism and the godly life and final death of their friends in the sure hope of a blessed resurrection prompt the living also to desire and receive baptism for the same blessed purpose.\n\u201cIn any event, even if there was a baptism for the dead that was prompted by the false notion that the baptism of a living person would benefit an ungodly person already dead (baptism by proxy), the practice would have been meaningless if the dead don\u2019t rise. By referring to such an unscriptural practice (if, indeed, it existed) Paul was not condoning it. He was simply stating that even such a custom was a testimony to the reality of the resurrection.\u201d\nIn summary, the apostle Paul speaks of a practice of which the Christians in Corinth were aware, but we today are not. That leaves us with questions\u2014unanswered questions. Regardless of the unknown practice, the emphasis in that verse and throughout the entire fifteenth chapter is on Jesus\u2019 physical resurrection from the dead. There is no uncertainty about that event. Many eyewitnesses saw the risen Lord. Earlier in 1 Corinthians 15 Paul listed some of those eyewitnesses.\nThe People\u2019s Bible series offers explanation and commentary on all the books of the Bible. Your church library may have that series. The series is also available through Northwestern Publishing House."}
{"prompt": "Matthew 5:32 and divorce", "completion": "Mathew 5:32 says that whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. Does this mean a divorced woman can never marry again?\n\n\nNo, that is not the meaning of that verse. Many Bible translations fail to capture the intended meaning of that particular point of Jesus\u2019 sermon on the mount. In \u201cA Study of Marriage, Divorce, Malicious Desertion, and Remarriage in the Light of God\u2019s Word,\u201d a document recently updated by our Conference of Presidents, there is a suggested translation of Matthew 5:32 that more accurately reflects the Greek verbs. \u201cIt was also said, \u2018Whoever divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce,\u2019 but I tell you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, causes her to be stigmatized as an adulteress, and whoever marries a divorced woman is stigmatized as an adulterer.\u201d\nThe point of the verse is that if a man sinfully divorces his wife for unscriptural reasons, his wife, who was not responsible for that sinful divorce, can appear to others to be guilty of wrongdoing simply because her marriage came to an end. That \u201cguilt by association\u201d perception could then unfortunately also extend to the husband of her remarriage.\nIf a husband divorced his wife for unscriptural reasons, that would not preclude the woman from entering into another marriage."}
{"prompt": "Witnessing to others about being born again", "completion": "I have several acquaintances who are members of non-Christian religions. I would like to be able to share the gospel with them, so I have been looking at some online resources like gospel tracts. All of these, however, end with the sinner's prayer and claim it is the way of salvation. This seemed very unscriptural and non-Lutheran to me. What would a Lutheran explanation on how one is born again be, and does WELS have any evangelism resources that would be more faithful to Scripture?\n\n\nThere is a need to be born again because by nature we are spiritually dead (Ephesians 2:1). Jesus spoke to Nicodemus about the need for rebirth, to be born again. \u201cVery truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again\u2026 Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit. Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit\u201d (John 3:3, 5-6).\nYou notice here is where the work of the Holy Spirit enters the picture. Just as we have no control over and are not responsible for our own physical birth, so we are passive recipients of the Holy Spirit\u2019s work when it comes to our spiritual rebirth.\nThe Bible makes it clear that rebirth is the work of God. In addition to Jesus\u2019 words in John 3, consider these Scripture verses. \u201cBut when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior\u201d (Titus 3:4-6). \u201cWhen you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive with Christ\u201d (Colossians 2:13).\nWhen it comes to evangelism resources, I would direct you to \u201cWhat About Jesus?\u201d This web site, maintained by WELS Commission on Evangelism, offers many resources that you could use in speaking to your acquaintances. God bless your efforts!"}
{"prompt": "Equipping the saints for the search", "completion": "My comments are really not a question but a suggestion. I see a need for a synodwide Bible class focus on the topic \"Equipping the Saints for the Search!\" Using the high quality of talent that we so often read in the \"Forward in Christ\" magazine, pastors can show us through Scripture how blessed we are, how lost other people are, and how necessary it is to search out and plant the seeds of trust that only comes from God's word. Thank you and God bless all of our efforts to serve.\n\n\nI will forward your suggestion to personnel in WELS Commission on Evangelism.\nAt the same time, I would point out the materials that are already available through \u201cWhat About Jesus?\u201d the web site maintained by WELS Commission on Evangelism.\nI join you in asking God to bless our outreach efforts."}
{"prompt": "Tattoos and body piercings", "completion": "What is the WELS position on tattoos and body piercings? \n\n\nOur position would be the position of Scripture for New Testament followers of the Lord. With that in mind, there is no general scriptural prohibition of tattoos or body piercings. People sometimes cite Leviticus 19:28 as support for God\u2019s will against such practices. The context of that passage, however, shows that it was meant only for Old Testament Israel. When the people of Israel entered the promised land of Canaan, God did not want his people imitating the idolatrous practices of the people in the land. Rather than being a fifth commandment issue, the prohibition in that verse was clearly a first commandment issue.\nSince New Testament followers of the Lord are not bound by the instruction in Leviticus 19:28, they can exercise their Christian freedom in this area of life.\nThe apostle Paul provided general guidance for Christian freedom when he wrote: \u201c\u2019I have the right to do anything,\u2019 you say\u2014but not everything is beneficial. \u2018I have the right to do anything\u2019\u2014but not everything is constructive. No one should seek their own good, but the good of others\u201d (1 Corinthians 10:23-24).\nAs Christians seek to be \u201csalt\u201d and \u201clight\u201d to the unbelieving world, they will try to make decisions\u2014even in this area\u2014that best represent the Christian faith. As Christians seek to build up and encourage one another (1 Thessalonians 5:11), they will try to make decisions with fellow Christians in mind.\nSo, could I ever give an unqualified approval of a body marking? Sure. It\u2019s figurative in nature, but the Lord told his people through the prophet Isaiah: \u201cSee, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands\u201d (Isaiah 49:16). That\u2019s a beautiful picture of God telling us that we are always in his thoughts and on his mind."}
{"prompt": "Marriage and children", "completion": "My husband is set on having at least one child, but I'm sure I don't want to be a mother.  This has caused us a lot of turmoil in our marriage since our pastors taught us in our pre-marriage counseling that we should be fruitful.  Can we, in good conscience, decide that we don't want children?  \n\n\nAt two points in the history of the world God spoke to people and instructed them to \u201cbe fruitful and increase in number\u201d (Genesis 1:28; 9:1,7).\u00a0 It was to Adam and Eve and also to Noah and his family that God gave those instructions.\u00a0 It is important to recognize how God prefaced those instructions.\u00a0 To both sets of people, God \u201cblessed them.\u201d\u00a0 That sets the tone for a biblical view of children:\u00a0 they are blessings from God.\nIn Psalm 127:3-5 King Solomon described children as blessings:\u00a0 \u201cChildren are a heritage from the LORD, offspring a reward from him.\u00a0 Like arrows in the hands of a warrior are children born in one\u2019s youth.\u00a0 Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them.\u00a0 They will not be put to shame when they contend with their opponents in court.\u201d\nThe language of the Bible is that children are blessings from God.\u00a0 God wants husbands and wives to look upon children as blessings.\u00a0 Not inconveniences on a lifestyle.\u00a0 Not drains on personal income.\u00a0 Not barriers to career goals.\u00a0 Blessings.\u00a0 If husbands and wives do not wish to receive these blessings from God, they will need to examine their motives.\u00a0 Are their motives good and godly?\u00a0 Are their motives in line with God\u2019s word?\u00a0 These are questions that husbands and wives need to address, and answer in unison.\nYour answers to those questions are not available to me, so to prevent any more \u201cturmoil\u201d in your marriage, I would encourage you and your husband to speak with your pastors, since they were involved in your pre-marital counseling.\u00a0 They are in a position to explain and clarify the scriptural guidance they provided before your wedding.\nMay God grant you and your husband peace, unity and steadfast love as you work through this important matter."}
{"prompt": "Michael the archangel", "completion": "Who exactly is Michael the archangel of the last few chapters of the book of Daniel, and what role does he play in God's plans regarding the Church and the end times?\r\n\r\n\n\n\nWhile the language of Daniel 10:13 and 12:1 allows Michael to be identified as the second person of the Trinity, the Angel of the Lord, it more likely describes the archangel Michael (Jude 9; Revelation 12:7).\nIn the latter chapters of the book of Daniel, God, in a sense, pulls back the curtain of world history and gives us information we would never be able to acquire on our own.\nWhat we do know from Scripture is that we Christians are involved in a spiritual battle of epic proportions: \u201cFor our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms\u201d (Ephesians 6:12). Those last chapters of Daniel inform us that not only are God\u2019s people engaged in spiritual warfare with evil angels but so are the holy angels. Those chapters reveal the battles that were taking place between a holy angel and an evil angel\u2014and involving earthly governments.\nAs we head toward Judgment Day we can expect Satan and his evil angels, along with their allies in ungodly governments and churches (Revelation 13), to do what they can to overthrow Christ and his Church. Satan knows his time for doing this is short (Revelation 12:12). But as we head toward Judgment Day we can also expect and count on God to use his holy angels, including Michael the archangel, to ward off evil and protect his people. How God will do that escapes our observation. What we do know is the final outcome: on Judgment Day Satan and his evil angels will be confined to hell forever, never able to bother God\u2019s people again (Revelation 20:10). How we long for that day!"}
{"prompt": "The languages Jesus spoke", "completion": "If Jesus spoke his words in Aramaic and the gospel writers later wrote them down in Greek, why do our pastors go to so much trouble analyzing the Greek in careful exegesis?  Couldn't it be misleading to examine every tiny detail in the Greek words, since they are actually just a paraphrase of what he said in Aramaic?\n\n\nIn a few instances the gospel writers did preserve Aramaic words spoken by Jesus. A couple of those instances are Matthew 27:46 and Mark 5:41. That being said, the premise that Jesus spoke exclusively in Aramaic cannot be substantiated. In the early first century A.D. it was common for Jews to speak Greek in public. There are historical examples of that practice. It would not have been unusual for Jesus to follow that pattern\u2014using Greek in his conversations in public and Aramaic at other times.\nUltimately it cannot be said with absolute certainty what red-letter words in our English Bibles Jesus might have originally spoken in Aramaic or in Greek, but that really doesn\u2019t matter. The doctrine of verbal inspiration means that God gave the Bible writers the very words to write down (1 Corinthians 2:13). The words that the gospel writers penned are God\u2019s words, the words he wanted them to record. That is why it is important for our pastors to study Jesus\u2019 words in the Greek New Testament.\nIn addition, keep in mind that there are 23 other New Testament books which we know\u2014without a doubt\u2014were originally written in Greek. God also guided those writers so that they wrote down his words. That too explains why it is important for our pastors to study those words in the Greek New Testament.\nThe education in biblical languages that our pre-seminary and seminary students receive is definitely a rigorous and demanding one. It is also a pretty rare one in the world of churches today. But what a blessing this education\u2014and the exercising of it\u2014is for our pastors and the people they serve. Bible class and sermon preparation can be done on the basis of Hebrew and Greek.\nAll that study of God\u2019s word in the original languages has the purpose of better understanding and relaying the precious truths that God has revealed in his word. We can be thankful that the Holy Spirit reminded the disciples of everything Jesus said (John 14:26) and that he led the gospel writers and all the writers of the books of the Bible to record God\u2019s words with complete accuracy."}
{"prompt": "School for grandchildren", "completion": "We have a Lutheran school here, but it is another Lutheran synod.  Can my grandchildren attend?\n\n\nThere is much information regarding your question that I lack. Are the policies of the school designed and implemented so that it is simply a private school, or do its policies put children of other faiths into situations whereby scriptural fellowship principles need to be compromised and violated? Does the local public school system pose a lesser threat to the child\u2019s faith than the false teachings of a religious school outside our fellowship? Would enrollment in the school blur scriptural fellowship principles in the minds of your grandchildren and wrongly minimize the doctrinal differences between the two synods?\nThese are some of the questions that come to mind with your inquiry. Because your pastor knows the schools in your area, he is in a much better situation than I am to address your questions with detail. I encourage you to speak to him. And I commend you for your interest in the education of your grandchildren!"}

If God did not remove that tree prior to the flood in Noah\u2019s day, it would have been destroyed then.\nInterestingly enough, the tree of life reappears in a figurative sense in the last book of the Bible (Revelation 22:2).

{"prompt": "Questions about Jesus", "completion": "Did Jesus have a body before He became incarnate (born of a woman)?  Does the Father have a body? Does the Holy Spirit?  Did Jesus come into existence when the Word was spoken by God? (\"Let there be light.\") (Jesus says He is the beginning and the end and all things are made through Him.) Or did He exist before that?\r\nIs the Father or Jesus the God of Israel in the Old Testament? Or does the Father speak through the Son (by the Word)?\r\nThanks !\r\n\n\n\nJesus did not have a body before he was born in Bethlehem. The Father and the Holy Spirit do not have a body. \u201cGod is spirit\u201d (John 4:24). While Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary some 2,000 years ago, that was not the beginning of his existence. Jesus once told a group of Jews: \u201cBefore Abraham was born, I Am!\u201d (John 8:58) On the night before he went to the cross, Jesus prayed to his heavenly Father: \u201cAnd now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began\u201d (John 17:5).\nThe God of Israel in the Old Testament is the Triune God: Father, Son (Jesus) and Holy Spirit. The writer to the Hebrews answers your last question: \u201cIn the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom also he made the universe\u201d (Hebrews 1:1-2).\nHow thankful we can be that in the Bible God answers these questions about our Savior."}
{"prompt": "Saving faith and sin", "completion": "Can saving faith exist alongside living in the sin of sex outside of marriage or homosexuality?\n\n\nThe answer to your question hinges on the person\u2019s attitude toward sin. Let me explain.\nWe could be talking about a Christian who struggles against sin like the apostle Paul described in Romans 7:15-25 \u2013 \u201cI do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do. And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good. As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me. For I know that good itself does not dwell in me, that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do\u2014this I keep on doing. Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it. So I find this law at work: Although I want to do good, evil is right there with me. For in my inner being I delight in God\u2019s law; but I see another law at work in me, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me. What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death? Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord.\u201d\nPaul describes a Christian who knows right from wrong, desires to do what is right in the sight of God, falls into sin, confesses that sin to God and enjoys forgiveness of sins through Christian faith, and yet struggles with that sin.\nOn the other hand, we could be talking about a person who professes to be a Christian, engages in the sins you listed but does not consider his or her actions to be sinful. The person might even justify or rationalize his or her actions. That attitude toward sin is dangerous. Impenitence is dangerous.\nAnd so rather than considering whether or not saving faith can exist alongside sinful activities or actions, we need to understand that saving faith cannot exist alongside impenitence. Impenitence is incompatible with saving faith. That is the message the church gives impenitent sinners through the actions Jesus outlined in Matthew 18:15-20.\nThe mere profession of Jesus as Savior does not guarantee admission into heaven. In the sermon on the mount Jesus addressed that mistaken idea (Matthew 7:21). People who profess Jesus as Savior and yet live impenitent lives are fooling only themselves not God. People who outwardly embrace Christianity and yet hang on to sin in impenitence risk losing the very thing they claim to have: salvation. People who identify themselves as Christians but are in reality impenitent sinners are in for a deadly surprise (Luke 13:3).\nTo be sure, God alone knows what is in a person\u2019s heart (I Samuel 16:7). For that reason, God alone can judge hearts (1 Kings 8:39). What you and I can do is examine our own hearts in regard to sin, repentance, forgiveness and Christian living (2 Corinthians 13:5). What you and I can do is speak the truth in love to a fellow Christian who is caught in sin (Galatians 6:1). What you and I can do is live our Christian faith so that others may be influenced positively toward Christianity (Matthew 5:16). God enable us to do these things."}
{"prompt": "Condemnation without hearing the gospel?", "completion": "What does God say about people who don't have the opportunity to hear the gospel? Does God condemn them without a chance to be saved and, if so, doesn't this go against the idea that God is loving of everyone?\n\n\nYour question is one that people have long asked. Allow me to respond by sharing what one of my predecessors in this position wrote for Forward in Christ.\n\u201cThe natural knowledge of God gives everyone powerful witness about his existence. All creation shouts to all with eyes and ears that one great Creator exists (Psalm 19:1-4; Romans 1:20). Man\u2019s accusing conscience also testifies powerfully to his responsibility to his Creator (Romans 2:14,15). Although such natural knowledge cannot tell anyone this Creator\u2019s exact identity, it should lead people to \u2018seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us\u2019 (Acts 17:27).\n\u201cSadly, \u2018there is no one who understands, no one who seeks God\u2019 (Romans 3:11). Therefore, \u2018the wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness, since what may be known about God is plain to them\u2019 (Romans 1:18,19). Stubborn rejection of that natural knowledge leaves all without excuse. God is just in judging those in Old or New Testament times who never heard his gospel.\n\u201cYet God has also shown himself zealous to spread that only message that saves man from his well-deserved plight. At least twice in Old Testament history everyone knew the gospel. After Adam and Eve\u2019s fall, God revealed the promise of the woman\u2019s offspring who would crush the serpent\u2019s head (Genesis 3:15). However, as generations passed the vast majority rejected that promise.\n\u201cConsider also God\u2019s patient mercy at Noah\u2019s time. God spoke to all who would listen through that \u2018preacher of righteousness\u2019 (2 Peter 2:5). Then, when judgment reduced the world\u2019s population to eight, again all knew the true God\u2019s promised salvation. Yet once again the vast majority threw away that knowledge.\n\u201cGod has continued his persistence in New Testament times. For all the book of Acts tells us, it tells us little about any apostles other than Peter and Paul. From Paul\u2019s letters, it\u2019s clear that Acts doesn\u2019t record even all of Paul\u2019s travels. The missionary zeal of many early Christians and the pages of church history testify to a rapid spread of the gospel. Yet over the centuries, in many places where the gospel was richly abundant, man\u2019s callousness led to a loss of the gospel.\n\u201cHuman nature blames God\u2014as if he\u2019s somehow unjust in condemning an unbelieving world. Yet consider history\u2019s tragic tale. God zealously hunts down sinful mankind with his gospel. Sinful people zealously refuse to be found, or once found, often run back into darkness.\n\u201cThere is no other way of salvation. We cannot quiet this concern by suggesting that perhaps there\u2019s some other way God will save those not won by the gospel. Other than Jesus there is \u2018no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved\u2019 (Acts 4:12). There is no other way to come to faith in that gospel. \u2018Faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ\u2019 (Romans 10:17).\n\u201cLet\u2019s not waste our energy wondering if God will judge those who die without the gospel. He will, with no apologies! Rather, let\u2019s take the challenge God lays before every generation of his children\u2014to spread the powerful gospel message with every ounce of our energy and with every resource at our disposal.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Diaconate", "completion": "Does your church have a diaconate?\n\n\nWhile the constitutions and bylaws of some congregations in our synod describe the responsibilities of a deacon or a board of deacons, those positions are like others in a congregation: they are staffed by volunteers who serve for a limited term of duty.\nPerhaps the form of ministry that resembles a diaconate in our synod is staff ministry. Martin Luther College in New Ulm, Minnesota provides the education for staff ministry students, and calling bodies have the freedom to provide titles of their choosing for the individuals who serve them. Some of those individuals have the title of \u201cdeacon\u201d or \u201cdeaconess.\u201d\nIf you are interested in more information on staff ministry in WELS, this link will provide that."}
{"prompt": "Should I take Communion?", "completion": "Should I take Communion? I was raised and confirmed with WELS, but I had sex before marriage recently and I feel awful. I'm incredibly guilty and worried and I don't want to do it again, but I know if I continue dating this person it will happen again. I'm waiting to break up with this person because it's his birthday. I don't want to hurt myself by taking Communion without the intention of turning away from this negative relationship. \n\n\nIt is impenitent sinners who need to distance themselves from the Lord\u2019s Supper until their hearts are changed. Penitent sinners like you and I are welcome guests.\nWhat I see in your words is the cry of a child of God: \u201cGod, have mercy on me, a sinner\u201d (Luke 18:13). That call for help does not fall on deaf ears. The Bible says: \u201cIf we confess our sins, [God] is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness\u201d (1 John 1:9).\nFriend, through his gospel in word and sacrament God offers and gives you forgiveness of sins. Through that same gospel in word and sacrament God strengthens your faith and fortifies you for more faithful Christian living. For those reasons\u2014and with a faith-filled, penitent heart\u2014be a guest again at the Lord\u2019s Supper.\nAnd then armed with the power of God and the motive of thanksgiving, resolve to say \u201cno\u201d to sin in the future (Titus 2:12). If ending the relationship you are in would be beneficial to your faith\u2014and you acknowledge that to be the case\u2014then you do well to follow through on that.\nFinally, let me remind you of the resource that is available in Christian Worship: A Lutheran Hymnal. On page 156 there is information on \u201cPersonal Preparation for Holy Communion.\u201d You might find new meaning in the questions and answers there that address the subjects of confession, forgiveness, the Lord\u2019s Supper and Christian living. I encourage you to read through that information at home or in church to help prepare to be a guest at the Lord\u2019s Supper. God bless you!"}
{"prompt": "WELS church practices regarding divorce", "completion": "A friend of mine contacted her WELS pastor regarding her failed marriage due to abandonment. She was looking for comfort and guidance. The pastor told her that he would need to send a letter to all members of the congregation naming the people and telling them of the divorce.  This, she was told, was common practice of the WELS, for the purpose of clarifying the church's stance against divorce. Is this the practice of WELS churches to send this letter and put shame on those getting a divorce?     \n\n\nThe situation as you have described it would not illustrate accurately the practices of our churches. I would like to think that you and I do not have all the information about this situation.\nThere is a time when we \u201ctell it to the church\u201d (Matthew 18:17). Those words are in the context of Jesus explaining what his followers are to do when they lovingly confront sin and impenitence in the life of a fellow Christian. That action comes about after individual and small group contacts with the impenitent person result in a continued denial or defense of sin.\nBut \u201ctelling it to the church\u201d is more purposeful than sharing information. Additional people in the church\u2014those in church leadership positions\u2014are informed of the person\u2019s sin and impenitent attitudes. That is done to add more voices to the call for repentance. \u201cTelling it to the church\u201d finally can materialize in a church voters\u2019 assembly meeting, to which the impenitent person is invited to attend to explain his or her actions and attitudes, and at which a vote of excommunication might take place.\nIf your friend\u2019s spouse has abandoned her, and he is a member of the congregation, the pastor will want to speak to him about his sinful actions with Matthew 18 in mind. At the same time, the pastor will seek to minister to your friend, providing scriptural guidance.\nAgain, I can only wonder if you and I are missing information about this situation. Speaking to your friend might help clarify matters."}
{"prompt": "Classical music and Philippians 4:8", "completion": "May a Christian listen to classical music? Someone once said that if you are doubting about something, put it through the Philippians 4:8 filter. If I put classical music through that filter, then classical music seems to be the way to go.

{"prompt": "Prayer and Old Testament Israel", "completion": "I ran across this statement a while ago:  \"The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much! However, I think we can't look at promises made to Old Testament Israel, and expect God to keep them to 2016 America.....\".  I believe this person was referring to the covenants made between God and his people, Israel.  Could you comment on this and enlighten me?\n\n\nWithin the Sinaitic covenant (Exodus 19:3-6), God did make promises to Old Testament Israel that had application limited to them. In addition, God gave Old Testament Israel ceremonial and civil laws that are no longer applicable today.\nOn the other hand, there are many promises God that made to Old Testament Israel that are still applicable to 2016 America. Chief among them are the promises of a Messiah, Jesus Christ, who came into the world as a child in Bethlehem and who will return in glory on the last day to judge all people.\nWhen James wrote that \u201cThe prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective\u201d (James 5:16), he was not referencing any promises or covenants that God had made with Old Testament Israel. While James goes on in the next verse (v. 17) to provide an example of powerful and effective prayer in the person of Elijah, an Old Testament prophet, the context of James 5 does not limit powerful and effective prayer to Old Testament followers of the Lord.\nKnowing the context of the quote in your question would probably help us understand the point the person was trying to make. As it stands, your quote lists a statement of fact\u2014that prayer is powerful and effective\u2014and a statement about promises made to Old Testament Israel and their applicability to Christians today. By themselves, the two statements are not accurately connected."}
{"prompt": "The national anthem and respecting government", "completion": "I was always taught to stand respectfully during the playing of the National Anthem. Now days it seems like people, particularly these professional athletes, disrespect the anthem, the American flag, and our military to \u201cprotest.\u201d  I\u2019m worried this mentality is going to trickle down to our kids. What can we tell our children God says about respecting government, authority and the U.S., even when you don\u2019t agree with something that is happening in the country?\n\n\nThe Bible is very clear in regard to respecting government and authority. The Holy Spirit led the apostle Paul to write these words: \u201cLet everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves\u201d (Romans 13:1-2).\nWhen Paul wrote those words, Nero was the Roman emperor. He was the highest governing authority in the Roman Empire. Nero was no friend of Christians. His atrocities against Christians are well documented. Yet, the directive of \u201cbe subject\u201d applied even to him.\nPaul was not God\u2019s lone voice in instructing Christians to submit to governing authorities. Consider what the apostle Peter wrote: \u201c Submit yourselves for the Lord\u2019s sake to every human authority: whether to the emperor, as the supreme authority, or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right\u2026Show proper respect to everyone, love the family of believers, fear God, honor the emperor\u201d (1 Peter 2:13-14, 17).\nHonor Nero? Yes, not because he generated respect by his life or actions, but because he filled an office and seat of authority that God had established. The fourth commandment explains that God has representatives in governmental positions. While people filling those positions may not represent God faithfully and accurately, God wants Christians to respect those positions of authority.\nOf course, none of this meant that Christians needed to obey a person like Nero when he issued commands that contradicted God\u2019s word. If Christians were caught in the crossfire of conflicting commands, it was important for them to implement the principle of Acts 5:29: \u201cWe must obey God rather than human beings!\u201d\nSo what does this mean for Christian youth in 21st century America? The fourth commandment still applies. God still has his representatives in the home, the church and the government. God still looks for Christians\u2014young and old\u2014to respect his representatives and to submit to governing authorities.\nWhat can Christian youth do when they do not agree with what is happening in our country? They can work toward positive change. They can contact appropriate people who are in a position to bring about such change. They can be positive examples of love, respect and impartiality in their daily lives. Can they follow the example of some professional athletes by kneeling during the national anthem? There is no law forbidding that. But one wonders how much support they will raise for their cause by doing that.\nThe use of a national anthem and any customs related to it certainly fits in the category of adiaphora: those things that God has neither commanded nor forbidden. Christians of all ages will seek to use their Christian freedom in ways that best benefit others. A person has good reason to wonder what the greater benefit might be when there is a kneeling posture during the singing of the national anthem\u2014especially when the song is regularly preceded by the announcement: \u201cLadies and gentlemen, to honor America\u2026\u201d When people ignore that announcement, it follows logically that they are dishonoring America.\nNo country is perfect. The citizens of any and every country are sinners. Sadly, the effects of sin will always permeate society. Kneeling during a song will not change hearts. Kneeling in prayer is a different story. Christians of all ages would do well to follow the instructions the apostle Paul first gave to Timothy: \u201cI urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people\u2014for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. This is good, and pleases God our Savior, who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth\u201d (1 Timothy 2:1-4).\nWhen hearts are changed through the word of God, then there are blessings\u2014for people personally and the land in which they live. As Christians of all ages live godly lives and testify to others about their Lord, may the truth of the psalm writer find application in our country: \u201cBlessed is the nation whose God is the Lord\u201d (Psalm 33:12)."}
{"prompt": "Circumcision and baptism", "completion": "Circumcision related to baptism heard from Calvinist perspective. Are the two in any way associated? What is the history of this discussion?\n\n\nColossians 2:11-12 speaks of a parallel between circumcision and baptism: \u201cIn him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not performed by human hands. Your whole self ruled by the flesh was put off when you were circumcised by Christ, having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through your faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.\u201d\nWhile circumcision brought male children into a covenant relationship with God (Genesis 17:9-14; Leviticus 12:3), Calvinists consider circumcision to have been only an external sign that pointed people to God\u2019s promises. While holy baptism gives new life (Titus 3:5) and the forgiveness of sins (Acts 2:38), Calvinists consider baptism to be only an external sign that points people to God\u2019s promises.\nWe can be thankful that God does not merely give external signs that point to his promises. We are thankful that in holy baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper God bestows real spiritual blessings to people."}
{"prompt": "Self-examination and close communion practice", "completion": "Are there any groups within the WELS who reconsider our positions on various items, particularly, close communion?  I am a life-long WELS member.  However, I have some concerns related to our practice of close communion, and believe we should reconsider this position.  There are many clear biblical issues on which we should, and do, take a stand.  This seems like a desire to set ourselves apart, not from the world necessarily, but from other Christians.  I don't believe, therefore, that this is a biblical position.\r\nWe reference I Corinthians 11:27-30, yet we seem to ignore verse 28 in which a person is to examine himself.  The Bible does not state that the church body or fellowship is to determine whether the person is prepared to receive the Lord\u2019s Supper, but the person is to judge him/herself.   \r\nMatthew 10:32 which you reference states:  \u201cSo everyone who acknowledges me before men, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven.\u201d  Have we become so arrogant as to believe we must be a member of the WELS to acknowledge Jesus as our Savior? \r\nWhile the gospels do not make it clear when Judas left the upper room vs. the timing of the institution of the Lord\u2019s Supper, the order in which Luke presents his gospel (Luke 22:19-23) very strongly infers that Judas was still present at the institution of the Lord\u2019s Supper and it does not seem that Jesus excluded him from the sacrament at that point.  If Jesus, who knew Judas\u2019 heart and lack of faith, included Judas in the sacrament, why would we as the church who cannot know someone\u2019s heart believe we should determine whether someone can or cannot participate in the sacrament based on the fact that the person is or is not a member of the WELS or ELS?  \r\nI believe that we are more in line with Scripture when we allow Christ confessing Christians who are not members of the WELS to commune with us, than we are when we refuse communion to believers confessing Jesus as their Savior when such believers attend our churches but are not members of the WELS. I fear this practice of close communion puts us in fellowship with the church in Corinth that Paul is admonishing in I Corinthians 11:17.\r\n\n\n\nIf our practice of close communion were to be reconsidered and changed, it would start with the Conference of Presidents, the group responsible for the supervision of doctrine and practice in our synod, and end with a resolution at a synod convention. (I would not look for such a change to take place.)\nThe rest of my response may seem disjointed, but I am trying to respond to your varied questions and concerns.\nSelf-examination is certainly the responsibility of every person who desires to receive the Lord\u2019s Supper. That individual responsibility does not remove a pastor\u2019s responsibility to \u201cKeep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be shepherds of the church of God, which he bought with his own blood\u201d (Acts 20:28). The communicant\u2019s individual responsibility for self-examination does not eliminate the pastor\u2019s obligation to be \u201cfaithful\u201d (1 Corinthians 4:2) in his work, including his administration of the Lord\u2019s Supper. Faithful work in that regard includes doing what he can so that the picture of unity that is presented at the celebration of the Lord\u2019s Supper is genuine and not contrived.\nMatthew 10:32 speaks of Christians acknowledging Jesus before others, and Jesus acknowledging those people before his heavenly Father. We sometimes use that passage to indicate how church membership is a way in which people acknowledge Jesus before others and publicly indicate their unity in faith and doctrine with fellow believers. A person\u2019s membership in a visible church is helpful information in determining whether they are able to commune in one of our churches. Nowhere have we said that people need to be members of WELS to acknowledge Jesus as their Savior. The kingdom of God is bigger than our church body. I would encourage you to re-read the usage of Matthew 10:32 in our literature.\nWe do not know for sure if Judas was present when Jesus instituted the Lord\u2019s Supper. His presence or absence does not have a bearing on the practice of closed communion. A previous response to a question similar to yours stated this: \u201c Jesus didn\u2019t decide whom to commune based on what was hidden in people\u2019s hearts, and we don\u2019t either. We decide based on what they tell us and what we can see\u2026.There was as yet no sign that Judas was not completely one with the rest of the disciples in everything that they believed and taught. If Jesus communed Judas\u2026he did so because there was no visible reason to exclude him. That\u2019s our practice, too.\n\u201cThere\u2019s also a principle at stake here. We derive our doctrine and practice from passages that specifically address the doctrine or practice in question. We learn how we are to administer the Lord\u2019s Supper from passages that directly address that issue, and the passages that establish closed communion are quite direct (e.g. 1 Corinthians 10:16-22, 1 Corinthians 11:23-32).\u201d\nOur close communion practice is biblical and historic. If it sets us apart from other Christians, then it means we are following God\u2019s instructions in Romans 16:17. For further information and explanation of our church\u2019s close communion practice, I would encourage you to speak to your pastor. He needs to hear your concerns and address them."}

There are many, many passages you could share with your friend. Here are some that come to mind.\n\u201cGod is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble. Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging\u2026 The LORD Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress\u201d (Psalm 46:1-3, 7).\n\u201c\u2019Though the mountains be shaken and the hills be removed, yet my unfailing love for you will not be shaken nor my covenant of peace be removed,\u2019 says the LORD, who has compassion on you\u201d (Isaiah 54:10).\n\u201cNever will I leave you, never will I forsake you\u201d (Hebrews 13:5).\n\u201cSo do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God.

For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord\u201d (Romans 8:35-39).\nGod bless your Christian service to your friend, and may God give your friend peace and strength through his powerful word."}
{"prompt": "Is my thinking about how to vote wrong?", "completion": "For most of my life I have voted for candidates based upon \"pro-life\" and \"pro-family\" issues.  This year I'm compelled to vote for a candidate whose political platform supports \"pro-choice\" and \"pro-gay rights.\"  Is it a sin for me to vote for a candidate who supports these issues, even though I don't?  My reason for voting for this candidate would be for reasons other than those two issues.\n\n\nMy answer to you would be different if you were seeking \u201cpro-choice\u201d and \u201cpro-gay\u201d candidates and voting for them exclusively on the basis of your agreement with them in those areas. My answer to you would also be different if you explained how conflicted you were with the choice of candidates, but then cast your ballot against the guidance of your conscience. Because of the rationale you provided, I cannot label your proposed action as sinful.\nVoting for candidates, especially at the national level, is a serious matter. When we move beyond the personalities and news sound bites, we recognize the party platform and personal agenda associated with each candidate. And when you and I cast a vote for a candidate, we are empowering that person to act in our behalf. That is why serious consideration of the candidates\u2019 stand on issues is so important.\nBut this is exactly where serious consideration can become so complex. One candidate may be pro-life, while being deficient, in your estimation, in personal qualities and/or proposed public policies. Another candidate may be pro-choice, while having, let\u2019s say, less overall negatives associated with him or her. In situations like this, Christians who wrestle with the choices\u2014and their conscience\u2014may arrive at different conclusions.\nIt may be that some Christians feel they cannot in good conscience vote for either candidate. It may be that some Christians take a \u201clesser of two evils\u201d approach and vote against the candidate whom they consider to be a greater danger to society. It may be that some Christians vote with some reservation but in good conscience for the candidate who represents most of their own values and positions.\nThe reality is that there is no perfect candidate; every candidate is flawed. In the end, a sinner will be elected to the presidency. I mention this not to minimize your struggles but to put this and every election into perspective.\nThankfully, in spite of the outcome of any presidential election, our God reigns; he \u201creigns over the nations\u201d (Psalm 47:8). God rules and reigns over the nations of this world in the best interests of his church. And so let me encourage you and all readers of this question and answer to follow God\u2019s instruction through his apostle: \u201cI urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people\u2014for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. This is good, and pleases God our Savior, who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth. For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all people\u201d (1 Timothy 2:1-6).\nPray for our country and its leaders at all levels, that the Christian Church and its members may continue to carry out its important work of proclaiming God\u2019s law and gospel to a world that desperately needs to hear it."}
{"prompt": "Lutheran teaching on apostolic succession", "completion": "What is the Lutheran teaching on apostolic succession/historic episcopate?\n\n\nThe answer can vary depending on which Lutheran church body you have in mind. Lutherans generally do not see the possibility or the necessity of having an unbroken chain of bishops going back to Jesus\u2019 apostles.\nExceptions to that view would include the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) and some Scandinavian Lutheran church bodies. ELCA\u2019s position on apostolic succession changed formally in connection with their full communion agreement with the Episcopal Church.\nWELS does not recognize apostolic succession as being necessary or commanded in Scripture."}
{"prompt": "Pastors attending conferences", "completion": "Should our WELS pastors be either attending or participating in the Change or Die Conferences  sponsored by the Siebert Foundation?\n\n\nWe do not maintain a list of conferences and workshops that regulate the attendance of our pastors. If our pastors are interested in attending conferences that involve individuals outside our fellowship, they will want to be alert to any activities or events that would compromise our scriptural fellowship principles and then not participate in them.\nBecause of the unity of faith that exists in the pastoral conferences of our synod, our pastors certainly have reason to put attendance at those conferences at the top of their priority list."}
{"prompt": "Pastors and exorcisms", "completion": "I know the Catholic church trains some of its priests to be exorcists.  I am wondering if the WELS has pastors trained to perform exorcisms.  If so, where did the knowledge of how to do it come from, considering it isn't in the Bible (as far as I know)?  Also, if we do have pastors who have performed exorcisms or have witnessed someone who is possessed by a demon, what documentation (if any) exists other than what's in the Bible?\r\n\r\nA different question, but along the same lines - in the WELS we believe that the Bible is the only true source of information about God.  However, satanic cults or witchcraft seem to have other sources of information for their purposes.  Is any of this legitimate?  If so, do we know where it came from?  Were these potentially texts that were thrown out at the Council of Trent?  \n\n\nOur pastors are not trained to perform exorcisms. Our pastors are trained so that they can personally\u2014and help others\u2014do what Scripture says: \u201cFinally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil\u2019s schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms\u201d (Ephesians 6:10-12). Our pastors, like all Christians, wield \u201cthe sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God,\u201d (Ephesians 6:17) in daily skirmishes with Satan and his evil forces.\nIf Scripture is the only true source of information about God (and it is), then sources of information that serve satanic cults or witchcraft do not originate from God. That information may have been written by people, but ultimately it came from the devil, \u201cthe father of lies\u201d (John 8:44). That information was not a body of literature rejected by the Council of Trent.\nYour questions are a good reminder that the devil is real. In a day and age when many people deny the existence of Satan and, thus, are unprepared for his assaults, we want to take to heart what God says: \u201cBe alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. Resist him, standing firm in the faith\u201d (1 Peter 5:8-9). As we implement those words, let\u2019s thank God for what the great Reformation hymn reminds us about in our battles with Satan: \u201cOne little word can fell him.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Children accompanying parents to Communion", "completion": "When I have gone with relatives to special occasions at their churches (baptism, wedding, etc) I have seen families bring their little kids and babies up for Communion.  While the children don't receive Communion, they are blessed by the pastor.  I was raised WELS and have attended a WELS church whenever I have lived in a place where one was near me.  Recently, my church had a change in pastors, and now children are going up to the Communion table with their parents and being blessed.  I have only ever seen this in LCMS and ELCA churches, and am confused about why it is happening at a WELS church.  I grew up to believe that you did not go to the Communion table until you were confirmed; parents often just left their little ones with another member of the church.  I have looked in the Bible, and on this site, and cannot find anything that says that is acceptable or not acceptable.  Unfortunately, I don't really feel like I can ask the pastor who has made this change. \n\n\nYour search in the Bible regarding this practice did not yield results because the Bible does not address it. The practice falls into that category we call adiaphora\u2014those things that God has neither commanded nor forbidden.\nIf God has not commanded or forbidden something, then Christians have freedom in that area. Of course, having freedom does not mean that Christians can do whatever they want, without regard to others. Romans 14 and 1 Corinthians 8-10 teach how Christians exercise their freedom as they interact with Christians whose consciences differ from theirs.\nIn the case of parents bringing their small children with them to receive Communion, this may be a practice that is new to you, but there is certainly nothing wrong with it. The fact that this practice was one that you formerly observed only in churches outside our fellowship does not make it wrong for a WELS church to implement it. There may be practicality and good spiritual reasons behind it: parents may want to commune together rather than individually, taking turns watching their children. Perhaps you could look upon these young children in parents\u2019 arms as the future of the church\u2014people with whom you will soon stand or kneel to receive the sacrament.\nIt always helps, of course, if explanations accompany changes in congregational life or worship. If that was not the case with this practice, a conversation with your pastor would be productive and informative."}
{"prompt": "Does God \"have a plan\"?", "completion": "A fellow Christian asked me a question that I struggled answering. For example, with the election, we hear so many people say, \"God has a plan.\" Or when an impending downsizing is coming:  \"God has a plan for you.\"  But what about situations such as a child in a third world country who is starving to death? Does God have a plan for the child? A child who suffers and dies and maybe not heard about Jesus?  Can you pass along ideas on how to answer in love based on Scripture?\n\n\nThe \u201cplan\u201d people often have in mind goes back to Jeremiah 29:11 \u2013 \u201c\u2019For I know the plans I have for you,\u2019 declares the LORD, \u2018plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.\u2019\u201d In that verse God spoke of the plans he had for the exiles who were living in Babylon. God\u2019s specific plans were that the exiles\u2019 captivity would last 70 years, after which they would be able to return to Judah and Jerusalem.\nGod\u2019s plans for the exiles were very specific, and by means of prophecy God made those people aware of his plans. When we speak of God\u2019s plans for people today, we cannot be as specific. In the Bible God makes general promises regarding his protecting love and providence. Because neither you nor I can know the mind of God (Romans 11:34), we can have difficulty identifying his specific plans.\nStill, we know from Scripture what God wants and desires. He does not want \u201canyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance\u201d (2 Peter 3:9). He \u201cwants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth\u201d (1 Timothy 2:4). He wants his gospel shared with people everywhere (Mark 16:16), including children and their parents in impoverished areas of the world.\nIn addition, God wants his followers to share the blessings he has given them to meet and alleviate the physical needs of others (Galatians 6:10; Hebrews 13:16). When people waste God\u2019s blessings or are selfish with them, it comes difficult to carry the burdens of others (Galatians 6:2).\nThe physical and spiritual plight of people around the world is a vivid reminder for Christians to ramp up their efforts to \u201clove your neighbor as yourself\u201d (Matthew 22:39). The prayer of the hymn writer is a good one to make our own: \u201cO Master of the loving heart, The friend of all in need, We pray that we may be like you In thought and word and deed. Oh, grant us hearts like yours, dear Lord, So joyous, free, and true, That all your children, ev\u2019rywhere, Be drawn by us to you.\u201d (Christian Worship 491:1, 4)"}
{"prompt": "Support for other ministries", "completion": "I have a friend who is a pastor in the LCMS. He is trying to raise money for a mission trip. Would I be violating any church fellowship or other rules if I donated to his mission fund?\n\n\nYour concern for scriptural fellowship principles, and not \u201cchurch rules,\u201d is to be commended.\nScripture provides general fellowship principles that we seek to apply to very specific situations like yours. Scripture does provide guidance such as: \u201c I urge you, brothers and sisters, to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Keep away from them\u201d (Romans 16:17). \u201cAnyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God; whoever continues in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take them into your house or welcome them. Anyone who welcomes them shares in their wicked work\u201d (2 John 9-11). \u201cWe ought therefore to show hospitality to such people so that we may work together for the truth\u201d (3 John 8).\nScriptural principles direct us to recognize when we do not enjoy doctrinal unity with others and to refrain from activities that we would be involved in if there were doctrinal unity. Those principles instruct us not even to give the impression that doctrinal errors are unimportant. Those principles show us that we want to work together in the gospel with those whose faith embraces the teachings of the Bible. It is clear that we are not to support, including financially, ministries that deviate from Scripture."}

In particular, the false teaching of dispensational premillennialism looks for the modern nation of Israel to have a prominent role in end times events.\nQuite simply, the Bible does not speak of the modern nation of Israel, nor does it add events to the simple timeline of the Lord\u2019s visible return on the last day.\nA book that sorts out biblical truth and error regarding the end times is appropriately titled End Times.

{"prompt": "The prayers of non-Christians", "completion": "Hello! I remember being taught in Confirmation class in the 70s that God does not listen to the \"prayers\" of non-Christians, and that they are not real prayers at all. Has the WELS changed its stance on this, or is my recollection faulty? Thank you.\n\n\nYour recollection is correct. The Bible teaches that there is only one God, the triune God: Father, Son and Holy Spirit; other \u201cgods\u201d do not exist (Isaiah 43:11).\nThe Bible teaches that God hears and answers the prayers of only those who are joined to him in faith (Psalm 34:15-16; Hebrews 11:6; 1 Peter 3:12). In the sermon on the mount Jesus explained that the prayers of unbelievers amount to \u201cbabbling\u201d (Matthew 6:7). The prayers of non-Christians are words addressed to gods who do not exist, and so they are meaningless and idle words.\nBecause this is the timeless message of the Bible, the \u201cstance\u201d of our synod has not changed.\nBut rather than ending my response at this point, I do want you to know that we strive to share God\u2019s word with people in our country and throughout the world, so that they may know Jesus Christ in faith, enjoy his salvation and then, with your question in mind, know with certainty that the true God hears and answers their prayers as his children in faith. The conversion of others is what we express in this prayer: \u201cO God, you have made of one blood all the peoples of the earth and have sent your messengers to preach peace to those who are far off and to those who are near.

{"prompt": "Questions about the canon", "completion": "Can you tell me how it was decided what books to include in the New Testament?  For example, Paul wrote letters to believers in Corinth, to Timothy, etc.  These letters were kept somewhere, by someone, and many years later another \"someone\" was led to include them in the NT.  Obviously the Holy Spirit did the guiding,  and I'm not questioning the fact the Scriptures are the inspired Word of God.  Rather, I am confused about the machinations involved/how/why were certain letters/books kept and assembled, and decided to be included?  Additionally, how were questions like those associated the book of James resolved, and how was the book of Hebrews kept and decided to be included when we don't even know who wrote it?  Sorry to be so long winded and rambling with this question.\n\n\nYour questions address the topic of \u201cbiblical canonicity,\u201d and much has been written on the subject. In short, let me emphasize the following points.\nAll the New Testament books had been written by the end of the first century A.D. The New Testament canon was complete because God had established it. When written, the New Testament books did not exist as a completed \u201cset.\u201d The gathering and collecting of New Testament books can be attributed to the apostles, who themselves wrote at the inspiration of the Holy Spirit (2 Peter 1:21). The apostles were aware of each other\u2019s writings (2 Peter 3:15-16) and looked for Christians to value those writings as God\u2019s word (Colossians 4:16; 1 Thessalonians 5:27). The apostles alerted Christians to beware of writings that were purported to be from God but were not (2 Thessalonians 2:1-2; 3:17; 1 John 4:1).\nAs the early Christians discussed the New Testament canon and debated which writings were authoritative and which were not, they considered who the human author was, whether there was widespread and universal acceptance of the writing beyond the original recipients, whether or not the church used the writings in its public worship services (as it did with Old Testament writings), and if its content agreed with the Old Testament canon. But more than anything, it was the internal testimony of the New Testament writings that convinced Christians which books God had written through people (John 6:63; Hebrews 4:12).\nThe subject of biblical canonicity includes the history of people who spoke against or questioned certain books of the Bible. Hebrews and James, the books you cited, are two of the seven New Testament books that have a track record of being questioned or opposed by people throughout the years. When we keep in mind the original recipients of the book of James, its emphasis on a living faith is completely understandable, and in no way contradicts the Bible\u2019s teaching of justification by faith alone, without deeds (Romans 3:28). The book of Hebrews is not alone in not having a human author definitively identified with it; there are other biblical books like that. In those cases, we simply have to say that God did not see it as being important for us to know who the human author was. Ultimately, God is the author of all the books of the Bible.\nI cannot pretend to provide an exhaustive treatment on the canon with my response to your questions. For that reason, you would benefit from reading other resources on this topic. I can suggest Bible: God\u2019s Inspired, Inerrant Word. It is available from Northwestern Publishing House. Free resources on this topic are available at the essay file of Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary\u2019s web site. The language in some of the essays could get technical, but there is a wealth of good information there.\nThe way in which God gave us his word and preserved it to this day is truly remarkable. We are thankful for that. Above all, we are thankful for the content of God\u2019s word: it shows us the Savior we have in Jesus Christ."}
{"prompt": "Baptism without godparents?", "completion": "I have a four-year-old son and I regretfully have not taken him to church regularly up until recently. I want to get him baptized, but I do not have special Lutheran people in my life to ask to be my son's godparents. Will a pastor baptize him without them?\n\n\nBy all means, do contact one of our pastors to arrange for the baptism of your son.\nRegarding \u201cgodparents\u201d or \u201csponsors,\u201d keep in mind that this is a custom of the church that is neither commanded nor forbidden in Scripture. It is a worthwhile custom, as sponsors have a specific privilege and responsibility of remembering the baptized child in prayer, reminding him or her of the baptism that took place and encouraging the child in the faith. But finally sponsors are not absolutely necessary for a baptism to take place.\u00a0 At the same time, if you want to provide for legal guardianship of your son, including spiritual care, you will want to take care of that through a legal document and not a baptismal certificate.\nWhile having \u201cgodparents\u201d or \u201csponsors\u201d is not a requirement for a baptism to take place, our pastors will want witnesses to be present at the baptism of your son. There are no qualifications, such as being Lutheran, for individuals to serve as witnesses at your son\u2019s baptism.\nI encourage you to contact one of our pastors to arrange for the baptism of your son. I\u2019m happy to hear that you are taking him to church regularly. The pastor who conducts your son\u2019s baptism will remind you of the ongoing responsibility you have to bring up your child \u201cin the training and instruction of the Lord (Ephesians 6:4). He will also remind you of and encourage you to utilize the church\u2019s spiritual educational agencies. God bless you and your son."}
{"prompt": "Genesis 3:15:  the promise of a Savior", "completion": "I am involved in a discussion of the gospel as presented already in Genesis:   \u201cI will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel\u201d (Genesis 3:15).  What are other Bible passages that substantiate the reason we teach this Genesis 3:15 passage as the first evidence of God's unfathomable love for mankind - the Gospel?\n\n\nRomans 16:20 speaks of Jesus\u2019 saving work in light of Genesis 3:15: \u201cThe God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet.\u201d Revelation 20:2 describes Satan as \u201cthat ancient serpent\u201d whom God controls and eventually puts out of commission.\nThe Bible explains that Jesus\u2019 mission in coming to this world as true man was to defeat Satan (Matthew 4:1-11; John 12:31; 1 John 3:8-13; Revelation 12:9).\nWith the rest of the Old Testament prophecies of the Messiah in mind, and in light of the New Testament accounts of Jesus fulfilling all those prophecies, it is clear that God\u2019s promise to Adam and Eve in Genesis 3:15 was the first promise of the Savior.\nIf we need any more proof that Genesis 3:15 speaks of the first Gospel promise, all we need do is look at Satan\u2019s actions after that promise was given: he was engaged in a relentless but futile effort to destroy the ancestral line of the Messiah and then to kill the Christchild himself. Satan understood what God\u2019s promise in Genesis 3:15 was all about.\nHow thankful we can be that God gave sinners one promise of a Savior after another.

{"prompt": "Different views on church and ministry", "completion": "I've been watching an LCMS TV YouTube channel and was wondering what the main difference(s) are between WELS and LCMS Lutherans? I heard that one of the main differences is how we view the office of the ministry, but I do not understand this well. Can you elaborate? Thanks.\n\n\nI will let the two synods speak for themselves, citing statements from their church web sites.\nThe Lutheran Church Missouri Synod states: \u201cWith respect to the doctrine of the ministry, since the days of C.F.W. Walther our Synod has held that the office of the public ministry (the pastoral office) according to Scripture is the one divinely established office in the church, while the church possesses the freedom to create other offices, by human institution, from time to time to assist in the carrying out of the functions of the pastoral ministry.\u201d\nWELS states: \u201cChrist instituted one office in His Church, the ministry of the Gospel. It is the task of proclaiming the Gospel in Word and Sacrament. Mt 28:18-20; Mk 16:15; Jn 20:21-23; Ac 1:8; 1 Pe 2:9; Lk 22:19,20. This office or service, the ministry of the keys, has been given to the Church, i.e., to the believers individually and collectively. Mt 16:19; 10:32; 18:18; 1 Pe 2:9.\n\u201cThere is, however, no direct word of institution for any particular form of the public ministry. The one public ministry of the Gospel may assume various forms, as circumstances demand. Ac 6:1-6. The specific forms in which Christians establish the public ministry have not been prescribed by the Lord to His New Testament Church. It is the Holy Spirit who through the gift of their common faith leads the believers to establish the adequate and wholesome forms which fit every circumstance, situation, and need. Various functions are mentioned in Scripture: 1 Ti 4:13; Eph 4:11; 1 Co 12:28; Ro 12:6-8; 2 Ti 2:2; Jn 21:15-17 (feeding); Ac 20:28 (watching); 1 Ti 3:2; 4:11; 6:2 (teaching); 1 Ti 3:5; 5:17 (ruling). In spite of the great diversity in the external forms of the ministerial work, the ministry is essentially one. The various offices for the public preaching of the Gospel, not only those enumerated above, e.g., in Eph 4:11 and 1 Co 12:28, but also those developed in our day, are all gifts of the exalted Christ to His Church which the Church receives gratefully and with due regard for love and order employs under the guidance and direction of the Holy Spirit for the upbuilding of the spiritual body of Christ; and all of them are comprehended under the general commission to preach the Gospel given to all believers.\u201d\nYou may be aware that representatives of LCMS, WELS and ELS have had informal discussions the past few years to understand better each other\u2019s positions on this and other subjects. It is our prayer that God bless those and future discussions."}
{"prompt": "Bible passages used to support abortion?", "completion": "Some people use Numbers 3:15 and Leviticus 27:6 as passages that support abortion. The reasoning is that since the baby is under one month old (the lowest age used in these passages), then it is OK to abort the baby. What is the Christian response to this?\n\n\nThe Bible verses of course do not in any way support abortion. The verses speak of the amount of money a person would pay the priests in order to redeem, to buy back, an infant who had been dedicated to the Lord in a solemn vow (Leviticus 27:6) and the minimum age for the census of the Levites that Moses was going to undertake (Number 3:15). The mere mention of children being one month old in these passages does not in any way suggest that human life that is less than one-month old is expendable and can be aborted. (I really have to wonder if those same people also think that the Bible verses in question give them God\u2019s permission to kill infants up to their one-month birthday.)\nBiblical references to children who were one-month old does not in any way mean that God did not consider them to be human beings until that point in life. Consider God\u2019s command for baby boys to be circumcised when they were one week old (Leviticus 12:3). Consider how the Bible describes God\u2019s involvement in giving us life in the womb (Psalm 139:13-16). Consider how in Exodus 21:22-24 God even spelled out the consequences for any injuries done to mothers and their unborn children. Notice how the phrase \u201clife for life\u201d in verse 23 reflects the truth that God views life in the womb as important of his protection as life at other stages.\nThe Christian response to people viewing Leviticus 27:6 and Numbers 3:15 as support for abortion is this: God considers human life precious, no matter at what stage it might be. God wants human life protected so that people can come into contact with his word and enjoy the converting work of the Holy Spirit. \u201cYou shall not murder\u201d (Exodus 20:13) applies to the unborn, infants, the elderly and everyone in between."}
{"prompt": "Baptism and witnesses", "completion": "Why is something as important as Baptism left to witnesses?  Why aren't more people being baptized as an adult and only taking someone's word for it that they were baptized?\n\n\nWithout context, I am not quite sure what is behind your question about witnesses for baptisms.\nWhen we baptize infants or adults, we seek to have witnesses on record. Those witnesses are in a position to verify, if need be, that the baptism did indeed take place.\nWhy not wait to be baptized as an adult? People have a need for baptism before they become adults (Psalm 51:5; John 3:5-6). Jesus\u2019 instruction to \u201cgo and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them\u2026\u201d (Matthew 28:19) does not have age restrictions with it. Little children can indeed have saving faith in Jesus (Matthew 18:6; Luke 18:15-17).\nWhen we understand the importance and blessings of baptism, there is every reason to baptize sooner rather than later. Witnesses can serve a valuable purpose in attesting that the sacrament was administered."}
{"prompt": "Sin and the work of the Holy Spirit", "completion": "I heard the comment, \"The only damnable sin is denying the work of the Holy Spirit.\"   I'd like your input on this statement.  \n\n\nThere are several responses I can offer. For starters, our sinful condition alone makes us worthy of God\u2019s condemnation (Psalm 51:5; Ephesians 2:3). Without even talking about words or actions or thoughts, our natural sinful condition by itself merits damnation.\nNext, any sin is worthy of God\u2019s condemnation (Romans 6:23; Galatians 3:10). Jesus made it clear that sinful thoughts are as worthy of God\u2019s condemnation as sinful actions (Matthew 5:21-22, 27-28).\nIn addition, impenitence over sin can lead to people receiving God\u2019s eternal condemnation (1 Corinthians 6:9-10).\nFinally, there is one unforgiveable sin, and that is the sin against the Holy Spirit (Matthew 12:22-32). I wonder if that is the context of the comment you heard. The sin against the Holy Spirit amounts to permanent, malicious rejection of the Holy Spirit\u2019s testimony to Jesus in the gospel. That rejection takes place against better knowledge. The sin is unforgivable because it cuts off the person from the only way in which there is forgiveness of sins: through the work of the Holy Spirit and his gift of saving faith.\nYour question is a reminder to take sin\u2014all sins\u2014seriously. When we take sin seriously, we confess it to God (Psalm 32:5). We confess our sins to God fully trusting in his forgiveness of sins (1 John 1:9). Then, cheered and fortified by the forgiveness of sins, we seek to distance ourselves from sin in the future (John 8:11)."}

The Bible teaches that baptism is a wondrous working of God that brings forgiveness of sins, life and salvation into people\u2019s hearts and lives.\nThe author of the article understands baptism simply as a symbol, representing the believer\u2019s commitment to Christ. The author denies that baptism washes away sins. The author does not understand how differently authors of classical, non-biblical literature used the Greek verb \u201cto baptize,\u201d compared to the way in which Bible writers did. The Bible writers did not prescribe a mode of how to apply water in baptism. Finally, the author denies infant baptism.\nBaptism is God\u2019s saving work (Titus 3:5-7; 1 Peter 3:21). It washes away sins (Acts 2:38; 22:16).

{"prompt": "Support of the Salvation Army?", "completion": "Is it acceptable to ring the bells or contribute money for the Salvation Army during Christmas time because of the charity they do, despite the false doctrine in the Salvation Army Church?\n\n\nYour question links the charitable work of the Salvation Army with the mission of that church, which is driven by their false doctrine. That is important to keep in mind. The work they do is in line with the mission of their church.\nAs you indicated, there is false doctrine in that church. The Salvation Army is a self-described \u201choliness movement,\u201d placing greater emphasis on the Christian\u2019s life than on what God has done for people through Jesus Christ his Son. The Salvation Army rejects the sacraments of baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper.\n2 John 10-11 (\u201cIf anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take them into your house or welcome them. Anyone who welcomes them shares in their wicked work.\u201d) instructs us not to support those whose teachings are contrary to Scripture. That applies to the church in your question. That applies to any church that holds to false doctrine. While we can appreciate the tenacity of the bell ringers of that church at Christmas time, we cannot support their mission.\nThere is no need to feel like a Scrooge by walking past the bell ringers. We can help meet the material needs of others (Isaiah 58:7; Galatians 6:10) through contributions to charitable agencies that are not tied to churches that hold to and teach false doctrine. We can give to our church body\u2019s Christian Aid and Relief.\nIn gratitude for God\u2019s blessings and in compassionate concern for the material and spiritual needs of others, Christians have reason for charitable giving at Christmas time and every season of the year. Yes, \u201cLet us all be cheerful givers To the glory of your name\u201d (Christian Worship 577:3)."}
{"prompt": "Sites of Jesus' birth and burial", "completion": "Should anyone believe when they are told a certain exact spot in Bethlehem is where the Christ was born, or that such and such a tomb is where He laid after his crucifixion?  Can anyone be certain of these claims?  Isn't it enough that we know that it all happened?\r\nIsn't it something that we go on faith about, rather having to know what we are told are the correct locations?  A lot is often made of particular sites in the what they call the Holy Lands.\n\n\nYou said it well: it is enough to know that Jesus did what the Bible says.\nWe do not know with 100% certainty where the exact sites are where those events in Jesus\u2019 earthly life and ministry took place. Some proposed locations seem more plausible than others, but finally we do not know.\nWhat we know from Scripture is this: \u201cWhile they were there [in Bethlehem], the time came for the baby to be born, and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son\u201d (Luke 2:6). What we know from Scripture is this: \u201cAt the place where Jesus was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever been laid. Because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there\u201d (John 19:41-42).

What is the WELS' position on praying with them? For example, at a Catholic sister's home they want to say grace before the meal.  Are we not part of the \"whole Christian church on earth\"?\n\n\nThere is one Christian church (1 Corinthians 3:16; Ephesians 1:23; 4:12). It consists of people who trust in Jesus Christ as their Savior (Galatians 3:26). Because only God can look into the heart (1 Samuel 16:7) and see saving faith (2 Timothy 2:19), we call this the \u201cinvisible church.\u201d\nSince God alone can see what is in a person\u2019s heart, you and I understand what people believe by their profession of faith. A person\u2019s membership in a visible church (where you can see who the members are) is a profession of faith. Membership implies that the person\u2019s faith and the church\u2019s teachings are the same. From there, it is a matter of comparing the teachings of a person\u2019s church with the Bible.\nWhen there is unity in faith among people and the churches to which they belong, then we can worship together (Hebrews 10:24-25), pray with one another (Acts 2:42) and work together to proclaim God\u2019s word (Joel 1:3; Mark 16:15).\nWhen there is not unity of faith among people and the churches to which they belong, God instructs us to not practice religious fellowship with them (Romans 16:17-18; 2 John 10-11). That includes not praying with them.\u00a0 While it can be painful to implement those instructions when it comes to family relationships, doing so lovingly can demonstrate that God comes first in life (Matthew 10:37-38).\nThe problematic scenario you described in your question can be resolved if the host of a gathering holds to the practices of his own family altar and does not put others in awkward or compromising situations by asking for their participation. If the host of a gathering offers prayer on his own, others can respectfully follow the guidance of Scripture and their conscience.\nChapter Seven of This We Believe, a statement of belief of our church body, addresses the subject of church fellowship in more detail. This link will take you to that chapter."}
{"prompt": "Human authors of the Bible", "completion": "Who were the authors of the books of the Bible?\n\n\nGod used some 40 men (apostles and prophets, Ephesians 2:20) to write the books of the Bible. The lives of those men spanned a timeline of about 1,600 years (1500 B.C. to 100 A.D.). Some of the names of those men are very familiar to us: Moses, David, Paul. Other writers are less familiar: Obadiah, Habakkuk. Some Bible writers were kings (David, Solomon); others were shepherds (Moses, Amos). The writers of some books of the Bible are unknown to us: for example, 1 & 2 Kings and Hebrews.\nWhile God used a variety of people to write the books of the Bible over a long period of time, the writings they produced came from God. Through the miracle of inspiration, God led those men to write exactly what he wanted them to write (2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:21)\u2014down to the very last word (1 Corinthians 2:13).\nIf you are interested in learning more about the human authors of the books of the Bible, Northwestern Publishing House offers some good resources, such as this one."}
{"prompt": "Follow up on question about divorce", "completion": "I would like to get a little clarification on a question someone else asked in the Q &A before about divorce. The person was asking about abuse and this is the answer that was given:\r\n\r\n\"Beyond physically deserting a spouse, the Bible does not specifically list other ways in which malicious desertion can take place (I Corinthians 7:15).  As malicious desertion is characterized by sins that are unilateral, willful and permanent, it could take the form of physical or emotional abuse, refusal to have sexual relations with one\u2019s spouse, or refusal to support the spouse financially.  Because of the complexities of relationships, Christian discernment and pastoral counseling are essential when it comes to determining malicious desertion.\"\r\n\r\nI would like clarification on the portion that says \"refusal to support the spouse financially.\" Before we were married it was agreed that my husband would take a manager position and support both of us. We've been married for over a year now and he has decided that he no longer wants to do that, nor does he have any plans of ever supporting both of us. I feel in Titus 2 God clearly says it is not the wife's position to be made to be a co-provider. I feel lied to by my husband and taken for granted. We've talked about this extensively and he will not budge on his stance. He doesn't know any married man whose wife doesn't work, some of those wives even make the majority of the income, and he feels I should be no different. I feel trapped in my marriage now.   Is this in any way a biblical reason for divorce, or should I submit to my husband as God also says in the Bible?\n\n\nThe portion of the answer that you quoted explains in general what forms \u201cmalicious desertion\u201d can take, including \u201crefusal to support the spouse financially.\u201d It would not be wise or practical for me to try to get into the specifics of your situation. This forum cannot substitute for counseling with one\u2019s pastor. So, I encourage you to speak to your pastor.

I know there are people out there who are hucksters and they know they are conning people. I want to know about the people who really believe they are listening and talking to dead people. Is this Satan who is doing this? \n\n\nThe connection between mediums and Satan is so well established that God warned his Old Testament people numerous times about mediums: \u201cLet no one be found among you who sacrifices his son or daughter in the fire, who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, or casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead. Anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord\u2026\u201d (Deuteronomy 18:10-12) \u201cDo not turn to mediums or seek out spiritists\u2026\u201d (Leviticus 19:31) \u201cWhen men tell you to consult mediums and spiritists, who whisper and mutter, should not a people inquire of their God? Why consult the dead on behalf of the living? To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, they have no light of dawn\u201d (Isaiah 8:19-20).

{"prompt": "\"Their god is their stomach\"", "completion": "What does \"their god is their stomach\" mean in Philippians 3:19? Is this referring to gluttony?\n\n\nIt could refer to gluttony. It can refer in general to any craving of the sinful nature that is elevated over God. That is idolatry.\nIdolatry takes place when people love something or someone more than God. In his Large Catechism Martin Luther stated this regarding the first commandment: \u201cThat now, I say, upon which you set your heart and put your trust is properly your god.\u201d\nRather than making the desires of the sinful nature a god, God\u2019s will is this: \u201cLove the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind\u201d (Matthew 22:37).

{"prompt": "Concern about praying with another person", "completion": "I understand the idea that humans are unable to see the hearts of others and so we base our decision to fellowship with others based on their religious affiliation.  In other words,  we would only pray with a person who belonged to a church that believed and taught according to the truths in the Bible as the WELS does.  My question is: is it OK to pray with someone who belongs to a WELS church, but seems to have rejected some of the teachings of the Bible? In this case the teachings in question are the Biblical teachings of the sanctity of life and fellowship.  I hope this question is not too vague. Thank you for your time and consideration!\n\n\nYou are correct in noting that membership in a visible church sends the signal that people have committed themselves to the doctrine and practice of that church. If a person\u2019s individual profession of faith departs from the church\u2019s doctrine and practice, one has to ask if that is because the person is weak in faith or supportive of error. If there is weakness of faith, we will try to admonish the person so that he or she can reject the error and embrace the truth (2 Timothy 2:25-26; Titus 3:10). If there is persistence in teaching or adhering to beliefs that are false, we will not practice church fellowship with them (Romans 16:17-18). Termination of fellowship is an action of the congregation.\nWhen it comes to answering your question, there are a number of pieces of information that I am lacking. The person \u201cseems to have rejected some of the teachings of the Bible.\u201d If you are wondering what course of action to take, there needs to be more certainty and clarity than apparent or \u201cseeming\u201d rejection of biblical teachings. You can bring clarity to the situation by conversing with the individual.\nIf your conversations reveal that the person is indeed rejecting biblical teachings, you want to find out if that is because the person is weak in faith\u2014but still receptive to being taught the truths of Scripture\u2014or if the person persists in teaching or adhering to false doctrine. The person\u2019s attitude will help determine a course of action.\nFinally, I am not aware if concern for this person\u2019s doctrinal positions is limited to you or if the congregation, through its pastor, is addressing the situation. I take it that the person is a member in good standing in one of our congregations. Praying with him would not be wrong, unless of course you cannot do that in good conscience.\nI would encourage praying for the individual and speaking to him or her to clarify the concerns you have."}
{"prompt": "Martin Luther and Jews", "completion": "I have read the WELS response to the question of Martin Luther's anti-Semitism. I have also read about his anti-Semitism on Wikipedia.  I do think that Wikipedia did a fair treatment of the subject without adding their own opinion.\r\n\r\nI have not read the book, \"On the Jews and Their Lies,\" but have read some of the passages online and was surprised by Luther's inflammatory rhetoric. He was not \"anti-Judaism\" as you have suggested, but truly anti-Semitic. \r\n\r\nThe surprising aspect of his harsh feelings about the Jews are that those feelings came late in his life. His aforementioned book was published three years before his death. An even more disturbing aspect is that the Nazis used his book to justify their \"final solution.\" \r\n\r\nSo, my question is this: how many Lutherans know that he was virulently anti-Semitic?  (And, if you disagree with \"virulently anti-Semitic,\" read his book.)\r\n\r\nThanks for taking my question. \r\n\n\n\nThe starting point in my response is that Martin Luther is not the foundation of our faith. Our doctrine or practice has not resulted from any of Martin Luther\u2019s writings. We certainly do not rubber-stamp everything he wrote. What we do is recognize that Luther was a highly gifted individual whom God used at a critical time in history to restore the truths of his word. Scripture alone, which points to Jesus Christ as Savior, is the foundation of our faith (Ephesians 2:20).\nWhile Luther expressed some views toward Jews that we cannot condone, his position cannot be described as \u201cvirulently anti-Semitic\u201d or even \u201canti-Semitic\u201d as the term is defined and understood today. Luther did not speak out against Jews simply because they were Jews. Luther wrote some harsh words because of the Jews\u2019 rejection of Jesus Christ as the promised Messiah (just as he wrote harsh words against others who were opposed to the gospel of Jesus Christ). As he did so, he included these words in his Preface to the work you cited: \u201cWe must indeed with prayer and the fear of God before our eyes exercise a keen compassion towards them [the Jews] and seek to save some of them from the flames. Avenge ourselves we dare not.\u201d\nThe supposed connection between Luther\u2019s writings and the \u201cfinal solution\u201d is addressed and dismantled by Uwe Siemon-Netto in his book: The Fabricated Luther: Refuting Nazi Connections and Modern Myths. I commend that book for your reading.\nIn this 500th anniversary of the Lutheran Reformation, Martin Luther is obviously going to receive attention, but we do well to keep him in perspective. Our gracious God deserves our greatest attention\u2014and praise. To him alone be glory."}
{"prompt": "The Holy Spirit and faith", "completion": "I know without the Holy Spirit we are blind, dead, enemies of God, so I'm just curious about the Holy Spirit's role in the Old Testament.  I was listening to a pastor from another synod and it sounded like he thought the Holy Spirit wasn't responsible for creating faith during Old Testament times.  Based on the conversation, I'm thinking he wasn't including the prophets, etc.  I tried to do research on my own, but it seems like scholars are all over the place on the Holy Spirit's role before Pentecost.  Can you tell me what our synod believes the Bible says regarding the Holy Spirit's work in Old Testament times?\n\n\nIn This We Believe, a statement of belief of WELS, we make this confession: \u201cWe believe that people cannot produce this justifying faith, or trust, in their own hearts, because \u2018the man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him\u2019 (1 Corinthians 2:14). In fact, \u2018the sinful mind is hostile to God\u2019 (Romans 8:7). It is the Holy Spirit who gives people faith to recognize that \u2018Jesus is Lord\u2019 (1 Corinthians 12:3). The Holy Spirit works this faith by means of the gospel (Romans 10:17). We believe, therefore, that a person\u2019s conversion is entirely the work of God\u2019s grace.\u201d\u00a0 [This link provides the context for that quotation.]\nConversion to saving faith has always been the work of the Holy Spirit. As the Holy Spirit changes hearts in New Testament times, so he did in the days of the Old Testament."}
{"prompt": "Assisting with Communion", "completion": "In our church, laymen assist the pastor in distributing the Communion bread and wine. Are there reasons why women can't assist the pastor with Communion?\n\n\nYou might be interested to know that your question is asked and answered in a Northwestern Publishing House publication: A Bible Study on Man and Woman in God\u2019s World. The question and answer follow:\n\u201cIt is clear that the Lord\u2019s Supper should be administered by the pastor or by a man authorized by the congregation to administer the sacrament in his absence. But can a distinction be made between administration and distribution? The Roman Catholic Church uses a number of lay altar assistants to speed the distribution of the elements to the entire congregation. In many parishes women distribute both the wine and the bread.\n\u201cSome European Lutherans argue that the pastor must retain distribution of the bread since it is at this point that the authority to exclude someone from the Lord\u2019s Supper must be exercised, but that women could distribute the wine since admission has already been determined by this point.\n\u201cIf the form of celebrating the Lord\u2019s Supper among us was such that the distribution of the elements was understood as simply assisting all of the congregation in receiving the elements (sort of the opposite function of gathering the offering) and if some other means of upholding the scriptural principles of closed communion was in place, it would be possible to defend the position that there are no theological grounds for excluding women from assisting with the distribution. For example, in the ancient church women were sometimes permitted to carry the consecrated elements to the sick. This was considered to be a form of distribution of the elements which enabled home-bound members of the congregation to participate in the sacrament along with the congregation.\n\u201cSuch a form of distribution without consecration of the elements in the presence of the communicant is not practiced among us. Although there are some precedents for the practice in the history of the church, I do not believe women altar assistants could be introduced in our congregations under present circumstances without serious problems of misunderstanding and even offense.\u201d (Pages 35-36)"}
{"prompt": "Finding meaning in life", "completion": "Is it OK to pray for death? My life is pointless and without meaning. My kids are older and my wife is self-sufficient.  I have no reason to stay alive but won't take it myself. Is it a sin to pray for God to end my life and take me away from here? \n\n\nI do have to say that I am very concerned about your question and your situation. While I am relieved to read that you recognize and intend to keep God\u2019s fifth commandment, which includes forbidding self-harm, I am troubled to read that you believe your life is \u201cpointless and without meaning.\u201d This question and answer forum cannot replace the conversations people need to have with their pastors and health care professionals, so I strongly encourage you to initiate visits with those people. Without knowing any more of your situation, a sense of despair comes through your words. That is serious, and that is why I urge you to speak to people who are in a position to help you.\nIn general, is it OK to pray for death? There is nothing wrong in expressing to God our longing for heaven. In the opening chapter of his inspired letter to the Christians in Philippi, the apostle Paul conveyed thoughts like these: \u201cFor to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain. If I am to go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know! I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far; but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body. Convinced of this, I know that I will remain, and I will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith, so that through my being with you again your boasting in Christ Jesus will abound on account of me\u201d (Philippians 1:22-26).\nYou notice that Paul had a longing for heaven, but at the same time he did not give up on this life. Paul\u2019s attitude was that he would use his earthly life to serve God and others until the Lord called him home.\nThat is the same attitude I encourage you to adopt. If you were able to type and send in your question, you have capabilities that can be exercised to the glory of God and the good of your family and others. As a Christian, you have at least one spiritual gift (1 Corinthians 12:7) that can be used in the context of your family, your church family and your community.\nOur life does have meaning and purpose\u2014and it is all because of Jesus Christ. Don\u2019t let Satan or others lead you to think otherwise.\nFriend, trust that God knows best regarding the length of our earthly pilgrimage (Psalm 31:15). Speak to people who can provide care for body and soul. Above all, listen to the voice of your loving God who says to you in his word and sacraments: \u201cI have loved you with an everlasting love\u201d (Jeremiah 31:3)."}
{"prompt": "Relationship and past sins", "completion": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have a question that I've been ashamed to ask a pastor in person. I've been living with guilt for the past few years, and it's gotten to a point where it's controlling my life and my emotions. Reason being: I've been dating someone for eight years, but in the beginning of my relationship I cheated on him. I know he would never do that to me. I also know I would now never do that to him.\r\n\r\nI have not yet accepted Christ into my heart, but I'm working on it. Once and if God forgives me, will he be able to wipe off my guilt? Also, is \"adultery\" in the Bible only referred to as cheating in a marriage? Or also a relationship? I'm afraid of the consequences, even though I have proven to God that I've changed through repentance, and actions.\r\n\r\nLastly, I have not told my boyfriend because I know he will not forgive me, and I don't want to lose him. Please do not make me consider this option because I will not do it. I don't want to lose him for something I did in the past, knowing I am a completely different person now.\r\n\r\nWhat should I do? \r\n\r\nBest regards.\n\n\nTo begin with, the Bible teaches that we cannot accept Christ into our hearts. By nature, all people are enemies of God because of sin and unbelief (Romans 8:7), spiritually blind to the truths of God\u2019s word (Acts 26:17-18) and spiritually dead (Ephesians 2:1). People naturally lack the power and desire to approach God in faith. Conversion to the Christian faith is entirely the work of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 12:3).\nGod\u2019s forgiveness, including the guilt of our sin (Psalm 32:5), is enjoyed through Spirit-worked Christian faith. God\u2019s forgiveness is complete.\nGod\u2019s will is that people avoid sexuality immorality (Exodus 20:14; 1 Thessalonians 4:3). That command covers single and married people.\nWhen we do the wrong that God forbids and fail to do the good that he commands, we confess those things to him, knowing and trusting that we have full and free forgiveness of sins (1 John 1:9).\nI can understand your reluctance to speak to your boyfriend about the information you have shared with me. On the other hand, you might want to consider what impact there could be on your relationship if your boyfriend were to learn of that information from other sources than from you. Confession and absolution can be powerful dynamics in a relationship. If you choose not to speak to your boyfriend about the information you have shared with me, trust in God\u2019s declaration of forgiveness and do not let the memories of past sins rob you of Christian joy and peace."}
{"prompt": "WELS and other churches", "completion": "How can our pastors be trained to focus on our doctrine without seeming to \"bad mouth\" other denominations?  My daughter and family have left WELS partly in response to denigration of other denominations.  Having come from a non-Lutheran background myself forty plus years ago, I understand her concerns.  I have had moments over the years of seeing WELS Lutherans as self-righteous.  Along with this, how can we follow the teachings of Luther without seeming to worship or elevate him?  My children asked me once when young whether we were Lutherans or Christians.  That was a red flag to me.  Thank you.\n\n\nOur pastors are trained to \u201cspeak the truth in love\u201d (Ephesians 4:15). That includes speaking about others and other church bodies. Since I do not have personal knowledge of what the pastors in your question might have said and how they said it, all I can do is offer a general response.\nPointing out error nowadays is not popular with many people, no matter how it is said. Many in our world claim that there is no objective truth and that one person\u2019s idea of faith is as valid and true as another\u2019s. Many in our world consider that pointing out error flies in the face of what Jesus said: \u201cDo not judge, or you too will be judged\u201d (Matthew 7:1).\nThe truth\u2014the biblical truth\u2014of the matter is that there is objective truth. There is right and wrong. There is true doctrine and false doctrine. The apostle Peter provides this information: \u201cBut there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you\u201d (2 Peter 2:1). Jesus instructs us to \u201cWatch out for false prophets\u201d (Matthew 7:15). Our God gives us this directive: \u201cI urge you, brothers and sisters, to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Keep away from them. For such people are not serving our Lord Christ, but their own appetites. By smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds of naive people\u201d (Romans 16:17-18). In the context of your question, we carry out that directive when we judge the confession of a church body, comparing what it professes to what the Bible teaches.\nSelf-righteous thinking has no place in the life of a Christian, including and especially when we compare a church body\u2019s teachings with the Bible and arrive at the conclusion that teachings of that particular church body are false.\nFinally, I would want to remind you that we do not follow the teachings of Martin Luther. We follow the teachings of God, as he has revealed them in the Bible. Luther himself is on record in this regard. He wrote: \u201cI ask that men make no reference to my name and call themselves, not Lutherans but Christians. What is Luther? After all, the doctrine is not mine, nor have I been crucified for anyone. St. Paul in 1 Corinthians 3 would not allow Christians to call themselves Pauline or Petrine, but Christian\u2026Let us cast out party names and be called Christians after Him whose doctrine we have\u2026\u201d [What Luther Says. Volume II, page 856.]\nLuther\u2019s attitude was accurate: we are Christians, people who follow Jesus Christ in faith. While there is one holy Christian church throughout the world, the members of which God alone knows (2 Timothy 2:19), you and I operate in the world of visible churches where we can see who the members are. In the realm of visible churches, labels like \u201cLutheran\u201d are helpful in readily and generally arriving at the doctrinal stance of a church.\nIn this 500th anniversary of the Lutheran Reformation, your question is a good reminder to stay focused on the all-important man\u2014the God-Man, Jesus Christ.\u00a0 God\u2019s blessings to you."}

{"prompt": "Witnessing by word and example", "completion": "A few months ago, I graduated from a Christian college where I was surrounded by like-minded Christians and was able to freely talk about my faith. After deciding to take a year off, I had to find a full-time job to support myself. I found a decent job, but often find myself in great fear/anxiety about truly showing my faith. I've talked it over with a few family members and friends and they've talked about living by example. While I know that we only have \"control\" over ourselves and what we say and do, aren't we also to use the Word to teach, rebuke, and train in righteousness? Is simply living \"by example\" enough for our Christian faith to be known? Is there some easy way to let our faith be known without \"soliciting\" or \"imposing\" on others?\n\n\nFear and anxiety in showing our faith can result from different factors. There can be the fear of ridicule and verbal persecution. There can be the anxiety of wondering whether I will be able to come up with a response if someone asks me a question about the Bible or the Christian faith. Since I do not know your particular situation, my response will be general in nature.\nOur God does instruct us to live our faith in our everyday lives. Jesus said, \u201cYou are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven\u201d (Matthew 5:14-16).\nOur God also instructs us to speak to others about his wonderful works. The psalmist wrote: \u201cGive praise to the LORD, proclaim his name; make known among the nations what he has done. Sing to him, sing praise to him; tell of all his wonderful acts\u201d (Psalm 105:1-2). God even directs us to prepare ourselves for times when others ask us about our faith: \u201cAlways be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have\u201d (1 Peter 3:15).\nI appreciate your question about whether \u201csimply living \u2018by example\u2019 [is] enough for our Christian faith to be known.\u201d If we do not speak to others about our faith, people could look at our lives and conclude: 1) we are Christians, or 2) we are nice, morally-upright unbelievers. When we have opportunity to speak to people, option number two will disappear.\nCan you let your faith be known without soliciting or imposing it on others? Certainly. As you converse with people at and outside your workplace, you can build relationships with them. In the course of conversations, as natural opportunities arise, you can speak of your faith. That way of sharing your faith is quite different from a \u201csoliciting\u201d or \u201cimposing\u201d approach that gives people the message of Jesus Christ but without the context of a caring relationship.\nPerhaps you could benefit from personal evangelism tools that are available from WELS Commission on Evangelism. This link will take you to those tools. God bless the witnessing that you do\u2014in word and by example."}
{"prompt": "Christians in government positions", "completion": "Christian ethics question:  when what God says conflicts with federal marriage laws and abortion laws, would it be OK that a Christian taking the oath of office just lie and say he will uphold those laws that conflict with what he knows God says? Or, should he not seek offices where he will be expected to disregard what God says when it conflicts with laws of the United States?\n\n\nLying under oath is not an option. When we use God as our witness to assure people we are telling the truth but lie instead, we break God\u2019s second commandment (Exodus 20:5). (See also Leviticus 19:12.)\nWhen it comes to Christians serving in government positions, we want to keep in mind that Christians live in two kingdoms: the church and the state. While God\u2019s word directs life in the church, natural law and human reason direct life in the state. Sometimes the state enacts laws that are contrary to natural law and human reason. What then? Is the state, the government, still God\u2019s servant (Romans 13)? Yes, but not a very faithful servant. Christians who want to serve in the state can do so\u2014even when laws run contrary to God\u2019s word\u2014by recognizing that the state operates on different principles than the church.\nMoses recognized that. As the leader of the church, he penned under inspiration of the Holy Spirit the establishment of marriage as a lifelong union between a man and a woman (Genesis 2:20-24). As the leader of the state, he wrote certificates of divorce (Matthew 19:3-9) that served to preserve order among Israelite society. A Christian judge might find himself in a similar situation: being in full agreement with the Bible\u2019s teachings of marriage and divorce (perhaps even taking part in a congregational vote on excommunication related to an unscriptural divorce), yet granting an unscriptural divorce in his court. Such actions on his part are not hypocritical; they reflect his involvement as a member of the two kingdoms of church and state that operate with different guiding principles.\nIf a Christian cannot in good conscience serve in a governmental position because the laws of the land conflict with God\u2019s word, that person will want to seek a different vocation, as you suggested.\nChristians will prayerfully seek to determine how they can best serve and honor God as citizens of both kingdoms, recognizing the principles that guide each kingdom and applying them as faithfully as they can to their situations."}
{"prompt": "Early childhood program request", "completion": "Our church has an early childhood program serving about 50 plus children.  Recently a parent asked that their son be excused from the classroom when prayers are being said.  Our literature given to all parents at enrollment states our beliefs and procedures.  The program has children sponsored by state agencies so we do receive government money but have not changed any policy as a result of these children nor have we been asked to.  We suspect the parent may be Muslim but has not given that as a basis for the exclusion.  Our question is: are we required to comply with the request ? If the child is excused, we will have to provide an adult to be with the child while he is out of the classroom. \n\n\nIf the handbook for your congregation\u2019s early childhood program is typical of other, similar programs in our church body, there is information in the parents\u2019 handbook that addresses this situation.\nHandbooks typically state that when parents who do not belong to the congregation enroll their children in our programs, they submit to the stated policies. One of those policies is that if children are not going to participate in devotional activities, they will remain in the room and be respectfully silent. There is no requirement to comply with a request that goes beyond that policy."}
{"prompt": "Questions about Bible translations", "completion": "A particular WELS social media group recently posted an article regarding \"The Wartburg Project.\"  The Wartburg Project is a 501(c)(3) parasynodical organization that consists of WELS/ELS pastors and professors that are united in fellowship and working on producing a new Bible translation called Evangelical Heritage Version (EHV). The website explains that this is another translation/revision where Hebrew and Greek texts and templates are being used as references. Why do we need another translation? Is WELS moving toward EHV? What is wrong with the NIV? Thank you so much for your time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\nMuch has been written recently about your questions. There is an entire section on the WELS Resource Center on the topic of Bible translations. This link will take you there.\nWELS has never had an official Bible translation. We have used NIV84 for years in our publications, but with the introduction of NIV11 (2011), Zondervan Publishing has asked Northwestern Publishing House to discontinue its use of NIV84 in future projects.\nA synodical convention resolution directed Northwestern Publishing House to pursue an \u201ceclectic approach\u201d in its publications. That means that editors and authors can choose the Bible translation that is best suited for their work. (Individual congregations of course have always had freedom to use translations of their choosing.)\nAs you noted, The Wartburg Project is a parasynodical organization in fellowship with ELS and WELS. It has an agreement with Northwestern Publishing House to print and distribute its translation.\nAgain, a great deal has been written on the topic of Bible translations recently. With this forum, I cannot do justice to all the activity and all the writing in this area, so I encourage you to read the information on the links provided.\nA major takeaway from your questions is that God has blessed our church body with a great love for his word and a great passion to use Bible translations that are faithful to the original languages and that speak clearly and accurately to people today."}
{"prompt": "Request for funeral service", "completion": "Hi. I'll get right to it. My brother-in-law passed away recently. My wife reached out to my church. My brother-in-law believed in God but was not a member. So the pastor was polite but declined to do the funeral, saying he couldn't attest to his character. My wife was highly offended by this. She asked, why does the church seem to snub its nose at people who are not members? Now she is leaving WELS. She says she'll talk to the pastor but only to say that she's leaving. \r\n\n\n\nI can assure you that the church does not look down on people who are not members. The church is interested in reaching out to people with the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nLet me try to address your situation this way. Our pastors generally officiate at the funerals of church members and also non-members from whom they received a confession of faith during their ministry to them. When one of our pastors receives a request to officiate at the funeral of a person who did not desire the ministry of the church during life, it certainly seems to be consistent with the wishes of that person not to receive the ministry of the church when life on earth comes to an end. If a pastor is not able to officiate at the funeral of someone who was not affiliated with his church or from whom he did not receive a confession of faith, there are ways in which he can minister to the survivors outside a funeral service.\nA Christian funeral service is a worship service conducted by the pastor of that congregation. As such, the content of the funeral service reflects the faith that the church teaches and the faith the members profess\u2014especially by their affiliation with the congregation.\nThrough their calls, our pastors serve as representatives of their congregations. The actions they take reflect on the congregations they serve. Through the decisions that they make regarding funeral service requests, our pastors seek to give the clearest testimony to others of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Through their words and actions, they want others to know that there is salvation only through Jesus Christ (Acts 4:12) and that acknowledging Jesus Christ as Savior is vitally important (Matthew 10:32).\nI encourage you to do what you can so that you and your wife have a conversation with your pastor. Do give him the opportunity to explain more fully the reasons behind his decision. I pray that God blesses you and your family with peace, love and harmony."}

{"prompt": "Trail Life USA", "completion": "Is Trail Life USA OK for a WELS youth member to join? Looking quickly at their web site I didn't see a pledge like the Boy Scouts' duty toward God.  \n\n\nAs Trail Life USA (TLUSA) calls itself the \u201cChristian alternative to the Boy Scouts of America,\u201d the concerns we have about Scouting apply also to this group. TLUSA does have an oath; adult leaders sign a statement of faith. In addition, the organization has resources for \u201cfaith-building opportunities\u201d and \u201cspiritual growth options.\u201d\nOn the FAQ page of TLUSA\u2019s web site, there is this question and answer:\n\u201cHow does faith factor into the program?\n\u201cAs a Christ-centered organization, our faith is woven throughout the program without being necessarily \u2018religious\u2019 or \u2018churchy.\u2019 From faith-building options in the advancement program, outdoor worship, to more in-depth discipleship opportunities, adult and youth members receive Biblical instruction and training in Biblical faith. As iron sharpens iron, so too will boys sharpen the faith of their peers. Adult Christian leaders will guide youth in the development of their faith and moral decision-making, as well as sharpen the faith of their adult peers.\u201d\nWhile the organization allows customization of the program for particular denominations, its ecumenical nature is problematic.\nAs you may or may not know, many of our congregations participate in Lutheran Pioneers, an organization within our church body that offers many of the same benefits of Scouting, without the objectionable religious requirements. That is an organization we can encourage our youth to join."}

The first passage explains that when people are joined to Jesus Christ in faith, they enjoy forgiveness for all their sins.\nThe second passage teaches us that when we sin and confess our sins to God (as Jesus taught us in the Lord\u2019s Prayer, Matthew 6:12), our loving God forgives our sins. Our confession of sins does not fall on deaf ears.\nPut together, the two passages assure Christians that they have full and free forgiveness through Jesus Christ.

{"prompt": "Tithing on gross or net income", "completion": "When I give weekly offerings of 10%, should I be giving 10% of my gross earned income or 10% of my net earned income (after taxes?).  I truly am not sure.  Thank you.\n\n\nI remember how a person in the past answered a question like yours. The answer went something like this: \u201cIf you had the opportunity to be given a raise in salary based on your gross income or net income, which would you choose? The way in which you look upon a potential increase in God\u2019s blessings in your life can guide you in how you think of responding to God\u2019s blessings by way of your offerings.\u201d\nThat was someone else\u2019s response to a question like yours. Here is my response. There is no right or wrong answer to your question. New Testament followers of the Lord enjoy freedom from the Old Testament ceremonial laws, including laws concerning tithes (10%).\nWhile you and I have freedom from those laws, it is not as though God does not provide any guidance for us. He does. He speaks of giving back to him in proportion to our income (1 Corinthians 16:2). Planning and giving back to the Lord based on a percentage of our income is definitely a scriptural approach. In essence, the Old Testament tithe has been replaced by ___%. New Testament followers of the Lord are free to fill in the blank. And if you desire to fill in the blank with a \u201c10,\u201d you can use that number in relation to your gross income or net income.\nRecognition that \u201cour\u201d money belongs to God (Psalm 24:1; Haggai 2:8) and gratitude for our salvation (Romans 12:1) provide good reasons for proportionate giving that is generous and cheerful (2 Corinthians 9:7).\nThe value of a percentage-based approach to giving is that it enables the giver to manage the fluctuations of income and still follow a plan for giving back to the Lord.\nGod bless your management of his blessings!"}
{"prompt": "Dispensationalism", "completion": "Dispensationalism:  what does WELS believe about this?\n\n\nAllow me to pass along the response to a previous question like this:\n\u201cDispensationalism is a false interpretive approach to Scripture developed by John Nelson Darby. Darby divided history into various periods characterized by a new test of natural man by God, each ending in man\u2019s failure. He proposed that God had two distinctive plans for history, one for the nation of Israel (God\u2019s earthly people), the other for the church (God\u2019s heavenly people). When Israel rejected Jesus, God created the church out of the Gentiles or non-Jews. Darby proposed that God would \u2018rapture\u2019 the church before the \u2018great tribulation\u2019 and eventually set up a political, millennial kingdom in Israel where Christ would rule physically and visibly.\n\u201cDispensationalism was popularized in America through a preaching tour conducted by Darby and a series of prophetic conferences known as the Niagara Conferences. It received its most widely accepted form through the work of Cyrus I. Scofield, popularized in the Scofield Reference Bible. Scofield proposed seven different dispensations (innocence, conscience, human government, promise, law, grace, and kingdom). This approach to Scripture and the study of the last times is the most common view taught in fundamentalist and evangelical schools and churches.\u201d\nWELS rejects dispensationalism and its errors associated with the end times. We state in This We Believe: \u201cWe reject the teaching that Christ will reign on earth for a thousand years in a physical, earthly kingdom. This teaching (millennialism) has no valid scriptural basis and falsely leads Christians to set their hopes upon an earthly kingdom of Christ (John 18:36). We reject as unscriptural any claim that Christians will be physically removed, or \u2018raptured,\u2019 from the earth prior to judgment day. We likewise reject as unscriptural any claim that all the Jews will be converted in the final days.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "To love or not to love the world", "completion": "John 3:16 says that God so loved the world. 1 John 2:15 tells us not to love the world. How does the meaning of \"the world\" differ in these two contexts?\n\n\nThe apostle John used the same Greek word for \u201cworld\u201d in both verses you cited. That word can have various meanings like \u201cuniverse,\u201d \u201cworld,\u201d \u201cthe inhabitants of the earth,\u201d \u201cungodly people,\u201d \u201cthat part of the world that is opposed to God\u201d \u2013 to mention a few. As you indicated, the context will determine the particular meaning.\nJohn 3:16 occurs in the context of Jesus speaking to Nicodemus about the snake-bitten Israelites who received healing through the bronze snake on the pole. Jesus explained to Nicodemus how that healing account pointed ahead to his redeeming work: \u201c Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him\u201d (John 3:14-15). Then comes \u201cthe gospel in a nutshell.\u201d \u201cFor God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life\u201d (John 3:16). \u201cEveryone\u201d in verse 15 and \u201cwhoever\u201d in verse 16 are not limiting in any way, are they? \u201cEveryone,\u201d \u201cwhoever\u201d they might be, can find salvation in Jesus because God loved the world, the inhabitants of the earth, and sent his Son Jesus into the world to be Savior of all. God does want all to be saved. We find that truth stated elsewhere in Scripture (1 Timothy 2:4, for example).\nWhen it comes to 1 John 2:15, the context paints a contrast between loving the sinful world (\u201cthe lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life,\u201d verse 16) and loving God. Christians are to love God more than anyone or anything else in life. That is the heart of the first commandment. God calls on us to \u201creject every kind of evil\u201d (1 Thessalonians 5:22). We are not to love the \u201cworld\u201d in that sense.\nTo pull everything together, then, the \u201cworld\u201d in John 3:16 refers to the people of this earth, while the \u201cworld\u201d in 1 John 2:15 speaks of anything in this life that is opposed to God and his will."}

{"prompt": "The fate of aborted babies", "completion": "Can we say for sure, or not, that aborted babies go to heaven? Jeremiah 19 says the children sacrificed were innocent. In Mark 10 Jesus blesses the little ones. I am not aware of Jesus ever blessing anyone not in His kingdom. Yet, Psalm 51 says we are sinful at conception. Can a baby be sinful and innocent at the same time?\n\n\nIn the Bible God does not specifically address your first question. If he has not spoken, we cannot speak for him. We know what God says in the Bible: people are sinful and have a need for forgiveness. Your reference to Psalm 51 addresses that. God also explains in the Bible that he is both just and forgiving (Exodus 34:6-7). God declares that faith saves and unbelief condemns (Mark 16:16). He reveals to us what means he uses to create faith in a person\u2019s heart. When we look at God\u2019s revealed will to us and cannot find answers to our questions (like the one you posed), we bow in humble reverence to God (Romans 11:33-36) and leave unborn children in the hands of a wise, loving God whose ways are perfect (2 Samuel 22:31).\nJust for the sake of clarification, the \u201cinnocent\u201d in Jeremiah 19 refers to people who, through no fault of their own, were sacrificed in idolatrous worship. Their description does not pertain to a natural spiritual condition of some kind. We speak of \u201cinnocent\u201d victims today: people who lose their lives through someone else\u2019s violent actions, for example.\nYou may not have this in mind with your last question, but a baptized baby is sinful and innocent at the same time (so are the child\u2019s Christian parents).

Rom. 3 and 4.\u201d (Augsburg Confession Article IV: Of Justification)\nThe Joint Declaration states: \u201c38.According to Catholic understanding, good works, made possible by grace and the working of the Holy Spirit, contribute to growth in grace, so that the righteousness that comes from God is preserved and communion with Christ is deepened. When Catholics affirm the \u201cmeritorious\u201d character of good works, they wish to say that, according to the biblical witness, a reward in heaven is promised to these works. Their intention is to emphasize the responsibility of persons for their actions, not to contest the character of those works as gifts, or far less to deny that justification always remains the unmerited gift of grace.\u201d\nThat paragraph uses \u201cgrace\u201d according to the Roman Catholic Church\u2019s teaching: that it is \u201cinfused grace\u201d to perform good works that contribute to salvation.\nThe \u201cagreement\u201d is a document of carefully chosen words that each side can interpret according to their belief on the topic.

When going through Catechism, my pastor did not touch on the subject of demons, other than to explain they were real and to be wary of them.

When I was young, I used to have nightmares about a dog-like beast, and sometimes I thought I could see or hear it, and these experiences didn't stop until my house and room were blessed by my mother and my very religious therapist. Is this just crazy ideology, and I'm an overly imaginative person, or is the possibility of a demon tormenting me real? \n\n\nDemons are real (Luke 8:26-33). We know from Job\u2019s life (cf. chapters 1 and 2 of the book of Job) and the apostle Paul\u2019s life (2 Corinthians 12:7) that Satan and the rest of the fallen angels can, under God\u2019s control, create problems in the lives of Christians.\nDemon possession is a complex subject. It can be useful to differentiate between spiritual possession and physical possession. Judas is someone who exemplifies spiritual possession. Physical possession is the kind that Jesus often encountered during his earthly ministry when he cast demons out of people (e.g., Mark 9:14-27).\nScripture explains to us that Satan is furiously going about his fiendish work because he recognizes the time is rapidly approaching (Revelation 12:12) when he will be confined to hell forever and be tormented forever (Matthew 25:41, 46; Revelation 20:10).\nIn the Bible God gives us this instruction and promise: \u201cResist the devil, and he will flee from you\u201d (James 4:7). Martin Luther illustrated his confidence in that promise in the great Reformation hymn: \u201cThough devils all the world should fill, All eager to devour us, We tremble not, we fear no ill; They shall not overpow\u2019r us. This world\u2019s prince may still Scowl fierce as he will, He can harm us none. He\u2019s judged; the deed is done! One little word can fell him\u201d (Christian Worship 200:3).\nI encourage you to speak to your pastor about your situation. He can provide biblical guidance and suggest other resources that may be helpful."}
{"prompt": "The Augsburg Confession and baptism", "completion": "I just went through Augsburg Confession and found that we must be baptized and have faith to be saved according to this document.  Also there is the passage that states:  \"Whosever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.\"  This says we need both, but the second part states nothing about baptism and condemnation.   There are many passages that talk only about faith in Jesus as the way.  Please clear up the baptism part as needed for salvation. I have never believed that.  There are some who might not be baptized that I pray will be in heaven.... babies and adults.\n\n\nAs confessions of faith are often drafted in times of controversy to state the truths of Scripture, it is important to keep in mind the historical context of the Augsburg Confession. The Roman Catholic theologian John Eck had been accusing Martin Luther and Philip Melanchthon of holding views toward baptism that downplayed its importance. In addition, the Anabaptists were spreading their ideas that baptism was to be limited to adults. With the drafting of the Augsburg Confession, the reformers were able to state to the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V what Lutheran churches believed and taught from Scripture about baptism and many other subjects.\nAnd so, Article IX: Of Baptism in the Augsburg Confession states: \u201cOf Baptism they [our churches] teach that it is necessary to salvation, and that through Baptism is offered the grace of God; and that children are to be baptized, who, being offered to God through Baptism, are received into God\u2019s grace. They condemn the Anabaptists, who reject the baptism of children, and say that children are saved without Baptism.\u201d\nWhen it comes to the \u201cnecessity of baptism,\u201d we distinguish between what is absolutely necessary for salvation and what is ordinarily necessary. Baptism is ordinarily necessary because of God\u2019s command to baptize. This is the way in which the Augsburg Confession speaks of baptism being necessary. Baptism is not absolutely necessary for salvation because God can create faith through the word alone. As you noted in the words from Mark 16:16, it is not the lack of baptism that condemns; it is the lack of faith that condemns.\nPeople have every reason for utilizing and cherishing baptism when they understand the Lord\u2019s command for it and the blessings that are attached to it."}
{"prompt": "Presidential voting", "completion": "Based on man and woman roles posted on this web site, is it sinful for a person to vote for a woman president of the United States, as she would then be in authority over Christian men?\n\n\nThe answer to your question requires some background information.\nWhile the Bible does provide specific applications of the loving head and loving helper principle (1 Corinthians 11:3) for the home (Ephesians 5) and the church (1 Timothy 2), it does not do that for settings in our sinful world. The principle still applies, but so do other principles\u2014such as recognizing that government is to serve as a channel through which God gives people earthly blessings such as peace, protection and security.\nBecause Christians desire that government be a blessing, they will pray for governmental leaders (1 Timothy 2:1-2). They will exercise the privilege of voting for governmental officials whom, they believe, will act in the best interests of their country. This is where Christians can be confronted with different scriptural principles, and where they might arrive at different conclusions.\nOne Christian might think along these lines: \u201cThe male candidate would not be good for our country. More damage to the country and its citizens could take place if he were elected. I recognize the scriptural principle of head and helper\u2014even though most people in society do not\u2014but to me the scriptural principle of maintaining good government is paramount, so my vote this time is going to the female candidate.\u201d So, no, it would not be sinful for a person to vote for a woman to be president of the United States. It would be sinful if a Christian cast a vote for the female candidate and by doing so went against the direction of conscience (Romans 14:23).\nThat\u2019s why another Christian might think along these lines: \u201cThe female candidate would be better for our country, but to me the scriptural principle of loving head and loving helper is paramount, so I cannot in good conscience vote for either candidate.\u201d\nAs citizens of God\u2019s kingdom through faith in Jesus Christ, we strive to be responsible and faithful citizens of our country. Your question illustrates some of the challenges Christians can face when election time draws near. Our confidence is this: in spite of the flaws in those who cast votes and those who receive votes, \u201cDominion belongs to the LORD and he rules over the nations\u201d (Psalm 22:28)."}
{"prompt": "\"Replacement theology\"", "completion": "How does replacement theology define the church and why is it important?\n\n\nSome people use the term \u201cReplacement Theology\u201d to mean that the Christian Church has \u201creplaced\u201d Israel as God\u2019s chosen people. Other people use that term to maintain that God cannot possibly abandon Israel and so he will establish an earthly kingdom for Israel during the millennium.\nRomans 9-11 helps us understand things correctly. That section of Scripture explains that the Christian Church is not a replacement of Israel but a continuation of the real Israel. God explains through the apostle Paul that when it comes to Jews, it is not ancestral heritage that saves (Romans 9:6-8). It is faith in Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah, that saves. And so in that part of the Bible God pictures Jews who reject Jesus, the promised Messiah, as branches broken off a tree, and Gentiles who are led to believe in Jesus as the Messiah as branches grafted to a tree (Romans 11:17-24). Those who have the faith of Abraham\u2014trusting in the promised Savior, Jesus Christ\u2014are the real Israel (Romans 9:8)"}
{"prompt": "Alcohol abuse", "completion": "Is alcohol abuse a sin? Or rather if someone suffers from alcoholism and continues to drink, are they sinning?\n\n\nYes, alcohol abuse is a sin (Proverbs 23:20, 31-33; Romans 13:13). Alcoholism can provide an explanation for drunkenness, but alcoholism does not free a person from individual responsibility of drunkenness or other sins. Alcohol abuse is still a sin.\nIf your second question has in mind the scenario of an alcoholic person intending to drink in moderation, wisdom and Christian common sense enter the picture. It is not wise for a person struggling with alcoholism to have temptation at arm\u2019s length. Additionally, continued drinking by the person dealing with alcoholism can result in further harm to one\u2019s body.\nIf you are looking for Christian resources in treating alcoholism, they are available from WLCFS Christian Family Solutions, an organization within WELS."}
{"prompt": "Satan and evil", "completion": "If God controlled Satan, would there be no evil?\n\n\nThe Bible explains that sin entered the world when Adam and Eve gave in to Satan\u2019s temptation (Genesis 3:1-6; 1 John 3:8). The Scriptures do not say any more about the entrance of sin into the world.\nGod certainly could have prevented the rebellion of Satan and the evil angels and the subsequent fall of Adam and Eve into sin, but he did not do that. In the Bible God does not explain his actions, nor does he have to.\nWhen it comes to unanswered questions that we have about God, I turn to a couple of sections of Scripture. Romans 11:33-36\u2014\u201cOh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out! \u201cWho has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?\u201d \u201cWho has ever given to God, that God should repay them?\u201d For from him and through him and for him are all things. To him be the glory forever! Amen.\u201d Isaiah 55:9 \u2013 \u201cAs the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.\u201d\nWhat we know with certainty is that Jesus Christ has defeated Satan and won forgiveness of sins and eternal life. Through faith in Jesus those blessings are yours and mine."}
{"prompt": "Prayer with action", "completion": "I am dealing with a friend who belongs to a community free church.  He believes that all you need to do is just pray.  I have been telling him that it is good to pray, but you need to take action.  He prays about getting a house, but doesn't take any action to make it happen.  Could you direct me to Bible passages or stories about this subject on prayer with action?  Thank you.\n\n\nA few sections of the Bible come to mind. In James 5:14-15 the inspired writer instructs his readers who are physically sick to get medical help and to turn to the Lord in prayer. Seeking help for physical problems includes prayer with action.\nIn the Garden of Gethsemane Jesus instructed his drowsy disciples to \u201cwatch and pray\u201d (Matthew 26:41). Christian vigilance includes prayer with action.\nWhen Nehemiah encountered opposition to rebuilding the wall of Jerusalem, he prayed to God and posted a guard 24/7 (Nehemiah 4:9). That account illustrates how concern for our personal protection includes prayer with action.\nI hope these sections of Scripture are helpful for you in your conversation with your friend."}
{"prompt": "Lutheran World Federation", "completion": "Did you hear about the Lutheran World Federation and the Reformation and the Catholic church? Is this a small group of Lutherans?\n\n\nIf you are asking if we are aware that representatives from the Lutheran World Federation and the Roman Catholic Church participated in a worship service last Reformation Day in Sweden, the answer is \u201cyes.\u201d\nThis is not a small group of Lutherans. The Lutheran World Federation is comprised of 145 Lutheran Church bodies that represent 74 million people throughout the world. In the United States, the only member church of the Lutheran World Federation is the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA)."}
{"prompt": "Lutherans and cremation", "completion": "What do Lutherans think of cremation, and what do you do with ashes afterwards?\n\n\nScripture is silent on the subject of cremation. It is a matter of personal preference when it comes to burial or cremation.\nThere was a time when some voices in the Christian church cautioned against cremation. In a day and age when some unbelievers utilized cremation as a way to defy God (\u201cLet\u2019s see if this supposed God can put me back together some day.\u201d), some Christians advocated that followers of the Lord not cremate their bodies, so as not to be associated with unbelievers or an activity of unbelievers.\nThat type of taunting has largely disappeared, so Christians today who make use of cremation are not likely to be confused with unbelievers. The choice of cremation over burial often includes ecological, economical and convenience factors. In the end, cremation essentially speeds up the process that occurs with burial: \u201cDust you are and to dust you will return\u201d (Genesis 3:19). And, regardless of cremation or burial, \u201cAll who are in their graves will hear his [Jesus\u2019] voice and come out\u201d (John 5:28-29) for judgment on the last day.\nThere is no church policy regarding the disposal of cremains.\nWhat a blessing to know and believe in \u201cthe resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting\u201d (The Apostles\u2019 Creed). God grant that same blessing to many more."}
{"prompt": "The marks of the church", "completion": "What are the marks of the church and where in the Bible can I find them?\n\n\nWe maintain this in This We Believe, a statement of belief of our church body: \u201c We believe that the presence of the holy Christian church nevertheless can be recognized. Wherever the gospel is preached and the sacraments are administered, the holy Christian church is present, for through the means of grace true faith is produced and preserved (Isaiah 55:10,11). The means of grace, therefore, are called the marks of the church.\u201d This link will take you to that quotation in its context.\nThe Bible, Baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper are the marks of the church."}
{"prompt": "Whose work is baptism?", "completion": "Is baptism something we do or God does, and where in the Bible will I find the answer? \n\n\nBaptism is something God does for us. \u201cBut when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior\u201d (Titus 3:4-6). \u201cPeter replied, \u2018Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off\u2014for all whom the Lord our God will call\u2019\u201d (Acts 2:38-39). Those passages speak of God working blessings in people through baptism.\nGod has done the work of salvation. God does the work of giving people faith to enjoy his salvation. To God be the glory!"}
{"prompt": "Jesus' appearance in art", "completion": "Why is Jesus depicted as white (Caucasian) in all the Christian artwork and movies? In \"My Son My Savior,\" \"Come Follow Me,\" picture Bibles, and even on the Facebook cover photo for WELS, Jesus is a white man. \n\n\nAs we do not have any images of Jesus from his life and ministry on earth, artists will use their skills and imaginations to depict a 1st century Jewish man who lived in Palestine.\nWhile we presently do not have knowledge of Jesus\u2019 physical features, it will be different when we see him face to face in heaven. Then we will know what the Savior of the nations looks like."}
{"prompt": "The numbering of the Ten Commandments", "completion": "I was recently talking with a family member who has changed churches from a Lutheran church to a Baptist church.  While we were discussing his reasons, one of the points that came up is a question that I have about the 10 Commandments.  In the Bible, there are clearly 10 Commandments.  When WELS students study the 10 Commandments in Luther's Small Catechism, the commandments are not the same as the way they are written in the Bible.  Why is this?  \r\nMy family member believes that this is one of the ways in which WELS churches do not follow the Bible.  It is hard to argue with that.  Why doesn't the synod just teach the commandments as they are written in the Bible?\n\n\nThe \u201cTen Commandments\u201d of Exodus 34:28 are literally \u201cTen Words.\u201d God spoke ten \u201cwords\u201d that constituted his commandments, but he did not indicate which was the \u201cfirst word\u201d or the \u201ctenth word.\u201d As a result, there have been three different numbering systems of the commandments throughout the years (the Jewish system, the Roman Catholic and Lutheran system, and the Reformed and Greek Orthodox system).\nSince God did not specifically state which is the \u201csecond commandment\u201d or which is the \u201cninth commandment,\u201d it makes little difference if people attach a different number to a commandment or \u201cword.\u201d The content is not changed.\nOur church body is following the Bible in teaching God\u2019s law. We are following the Bible in teaching God\u2019s gospel. We are following the Bible in teaching and administering baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper.\nIt is that last thought that helps put your family member\u2019s concern in perspective. You would do well to ask your family member what his or her Baptist church teaches about baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper. By leaving a Lutheran church and joining a Baptist church, your family member has left a church that teaches accurately from Scripture that baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper are means of grace through which God offers and gives us forgiveness of sins, life and salvation, and instead joined a church that teaches that baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper are mere symbols of God\u2019s grace.\nHow we number the commandments is an adiaphoron\u2014a matter on which the Bible is silent. It is far different with baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper. People have no right to change what God has said about those gracious acts. I encourage you to have a conversation with your family member on that important subject."}
{"prompt": "The devil and hell", "completion": "Did God create the devil and hell?\n\n\nIn a cemetery in my hometown, there is a monument with two statements and a question. The question is: \u201cWhy did a good God create a bad devil?\u201d\nIt is a bad question because God did not create a \u201cbad devil.\u201d God created all things, including the angels, during the six days of creation. The Bible does not tell us on which day God created the angels. At the end of God\u2019s creating work, he pronounced everything he had made, including the angels, as \u201cvery good\u201d (Genesis 1:31). At some point after that\u2014and prior to the temptation in the Garden of Eden\u2014Satan and other angels rebelled against God and were cast into hell (2 Peter 2:4).\nThe Bible describes hell as being \u201cprepared for the devil and his angels\u201d (Matthew 25:41). That same Bible verse speaks of hell as the place to which unbelievers will be sentenced forever.\nYour question underscores the urgency of spreading the life-saving gospel of Jesus Christ so that, instead of experiencing hell, people may enjoy eternal life with God in heaven (Matthew 25:34)."}
{"prompt": "Spirit and soul", "completion": "What is the difference between a spirit and a soul?\r\n\r\n\n\n\nWhile there are some who believe that human beings consist of three distinct parts\u2014body, soul and spirit\u2014the Bible most often describes people as consisting of two parts: body and soul/spirit. The Bible most often uses \u201csoul\u201d and \u201cspirit\u201d interchangeably.\nOverall, the Bible uses \u201csoul\u201d in relationship to the body, while it uses \u201cspirit\u201d in a person\u2019s relationship to God."}
{"prompt": "Pastors, politics, pulpits", "completion": "What are pastors taught about preaching politics from the pulpit?\n\n\nThe WELS Tax Information Manual provides helpful information for pastors and congregations when it comes to their involvement in politics. Following is a pertinent part of that manual.\n\u201cUnder the IRC, all section 501(c)(3) organizations are absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office. Contributions to political campaign funds or public statements of position (verbal or written) made on behalf of the exempt organization in favor of or in opposition to any candidate for public office clearly violate the prohibition against political campaign activity. Violation of this prohibition may result in denial or revocation of tax-exempt status and the imposition of certain excise tax.\n\u201cCertain activities or expenditures may not be prohibited depending on the facts and circumstances. For example, certain voter education activities (including the presentation of public forums and the publication of voter education guides) conducted in a non-partisan manner does not constitute prohibited political campaign activity.\n\u201cIn addition, other activities intended to encourage people to participate in the electoral process, such as voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives, would not constitute prohibited political campaign activity if conducted in non-partisan manner. On the other hand, voter education or registration activities with evidence of bias that: (a) would favor one candidate over another; (b) oppose a candidate in some manner; or (c) have the effect of favoring a candidate or group of\ncandidates, will constitute prohibited participation or intervention.\u201d\nFrom the pulpit, our pastors will encourage good citizenship (Romans 13:1-7) without endorsing specific candidates."}
{"prompt": "Girl Scout Cookies", "completion": "I was told, because WELS does not allow Girl Scouts/Boy Scouts (which I know and understand why), that we are forbidden to eat Girl Scout cookies?  They said first off, you can't buy them, as you'd be supporting them indirectly; but they also added, we are not to eat the cookies.  Can you expound on this for me?  Thank you.\n\n\nI really cannot expound on something that is incorrect. There is no synodwide practice that addresses eating cookies\u2014regardless of their source. You will want to contact the people who shared that misinformation with you."}
{"prompt": "Use of alcohol", "completion": "If drinking is not necessarily bad, does that mean drinking a little too much in the right company may not be a bad thing? As in one may have a drink more than necessary when you know no harm will come out of it. And is it OK to enjoy such things? \n\n\nSin is sin, whether we are in the right company or the wrong company. Our actions, not our company, determine whether or not we have sinned against God\u2019s will.\nIn the context of your question, it is sinful to drink alcohol to excess. That is true whether we are in the right company, the wrong company or all alone.\nThe Bible does not condemn the use of alcohol (Psalm 104:15; 1 Timothy 5:23). It condemns the abuse of alcohol (Romans 13:13: Ephesians 5:18)."}
{"prompt": "Prayer and scriptural fellowship principles", "completion": "If a non-WELS Christian leads a prayer with other non-WELS Christians and this person only reads the Lord's Prayer as the prayer, does this still constitute corporate prayer and therefore would preclude a WELS Christian from participating in the prayer? If there is more to the person's prayer, would it be wrong to participate in only the part in which the Lord's Prayer is recited?\n\n\nIt is not the content of a prayer or the form of a prayer that determines whether or not we pray with others. The usage of a common prayer does not suspend scriptural fellowship principles (Romans 16:17-18; Ephesians 4:3-6; 2 John 10-11).\nWe pray with others when there is oneness in faith. And when there is unity of faith, we can pray with a familiar prayer, like the Lord\u2019s Prayer, or with other prayers."}
{"prompt": "Mentoring materials", "completion": "Does WELS have any mentoring material for starting a group for new moms and moms to be?\n\n\nThe WELS Women\u2019s Ministry section of this web site has information that may be helpful to you.\nYou can also find valuable articles and ideas from Forward in Christ\u2019s Heart to Heart Parent Conversations.\nGod bless your efforts!"}
{"prompt": "European churches in fellowship with WELS", "completion": "Are there any churches in Europe that are in fellowship with WELS, or at least have the same teachings? \n\n\nWELS is in fellowship with almost 30 churches throughout the world\u2014including churches in Europe. All these churches belong to the Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference (CELC). This link will take to the web site of the CELC, where you can find information on the churches and the work of the CELC.\nChristian fellowship is a wonderful blessing from God (Psalm 133:1). The CELC is an example of that blessing."}
{"prompt": "Disposal of Communion wine", "completion": "What is the proper disposal of Communion wine?\n\n\nUnused wine from individual cups and the flagon can be stored in bottles and reused. I imagine your question concerns wine that remains in the chalice, the common cup.\nThere is no prescribed way of disposing of that wine. Some churches have a sink with a drain that bypasses the regular wastewater system and instead deposits the wine on the ground outside the church. Other churches simply dispose of the leftover wine through a regular sink and drain.\nChurches will determine how they respectfully dispose of the element that was used in the sacrament."}
{"prompt": "Souls under the altar", "completion": "I'm confused on Bible passage about souls under the altar.  I believe it's in Revelation.  I know we do not believe in purgatory or seven years of fire, but would appreciate what \"souls under the altar\" refers to. Thank you.\n\n\nYou are asking about content from Revelation chapter six. In that part of Revelation, the apostle John is relaying information about what we can expect to see taking place on this earth until the day the Lord returns visibly and in glory. What we can expect (Revelation 6:9-11) is that followers of the Lord will be persecuted.\nThe apostle John knew about persecution firsthand. When he penned Revelation, he was an exile on the island of Patmos because of his faith (Revelation 1:9). We learn in Revelation 6:9-11 that some Christians will experience the most severe form of persecution: paying for their testimony about Jesus with their lives. Jesus provided similar information in Matthew 24:9.\nSome of the first recipients of the book of Revelation (those who belonged to the churches listed in chapters two and three) may have had family members or Christian friends who were killed for their faith. Did their martyrdom mean that they were to be pitied? Were those Christians who were killed for the faith now lacking anything? Not at all. They and all martyred followers of the Lord are described as being \u201cunder the altar\u201d (Revelation 6:9).\nThink of the symbolism associated with altars in biblical times and altars in our churches today: altars symbolize the presence of God. Now think of the meaning of that vision in Revelation chapter six. Christians who had been killed for the faith are described as being under the altar of God in heaven. There is of course no need for an altar in heaven to symbolize the presence of God. Christians who die in the faith, no matter how their earthly lives end, enter the presence of God. But remember that Revelation was written for people still living on earth, so in this vision we find an altar in heaven that represents the presence of God.\nThis vision in Revelation is packed with tremendous meaning and comfort. When Christians die, they enter the presence of God in heaven. They are not merely near an object\u2014an altar\u2014that represents the presence of God; they are in the presence of God. They are free from all spiritual enemies. They are safe and secure forever.\nThis vision demonstrates the purpose of the book of Revelation: it is designed to provide comfort and strength to God\u2019s people."}
{"prompt": "Holy Ghost, Holy Spirit", "completion": "In the Old Testament they use Holy Ghost and in the New Testament they use Holy Spirit.  Is there a difference, or do they refer to the same thing?\n\n\nI am not entirely sure what \u201cthey\u201d in your question is referencing.\nEnglish Bible translations have used \u201cHoly Ghost\u201d and \u201cHoly Spirit\u201d to refer to the third person of the Trinity. There is no difference. Both names are accurate translations of the biblical languages."}
{"prompt": "Follow up question to unused Communion elements", "completion": "I have a question in relation to one you answered recently. If there is Communion wine left in the individual cups, and wafers left in the bowl, should these be kept separate from their containers as they have been consecrated leading into the distribution?\n\n\nThere is no need to keep separate the elements that were consecrated and not used in a Communion service and the elements that have not yet been consecrated. In the context of the sacrament of Holy Communion, \u201cconsecrate\u201d means to set aside publicly the elements of the Lord\u2019s Supper so that they can be used in the way the Lord intended: to eat and drink. The consecrated elements that were not used in the way the Lord intended are not different from the supply of wafers and wine ready to be consecrated in future Holy Communion services, so they do not need to be kept separate.\nYour follow up question can serve as an encouragement for pastors to continue to speak regularly to altar guilds regarding the work they carry out."}
{"prompt": "Angels and sin", "completion": "Can angels sin now? \n\n\nScripture speaks only of the sin, the rebellion, of certain angels that took place after their creation (Jude 6; 2 Peter 2:4) and before the temptation of Adam and Eve. Those angels are now in hell and will spend eternity apart from God (Matthew 25:41).\nThe Bible does speak of \u201celect angels\u201d (1 Timothy 5:21). We usually understand \u201celect\u201d in this case to refer to the holy angels who did not rebel against God after their creation and who cannot sin against him now. We speak of these angels being confirmed in their holiness.\nThese are the angels God uses for our good in everyday life (Hebrews 1:14)."}
{"prompt": "Study Bibles", "completion": "I want to purchase a Bible with explanations from an accurate source.  Do you have a publication that you could recommend?  Who are your trusted publishers?  Thanks.   \n\n\nThe publisher for our church body is Northwestern Publishing House.\nYou can find numerous study Bibles on their website at nph.net. Among the noteworthy titles are the Concordia Self-Study Bible and the 41-volume set of The People\u2019s Bible Series. Just search for those titles and they should come up."}
{"prompt": "Roles of men and women", "completion": "Why does WELS practice such restrictive and conservative beliefs regarding the roles of women? Why do you believe women cannot vote, be pastors or serve on church councils? This just seems so backwards.\n\n\nOur aim is to be faithful to God and his word in applying biblical principles, including God\u2019s design for the ways in which men and women go about their earthly lives. Considering that God made men and women to be different from one another, it does not come as a surprise that God gave them different but complementary roles (1 Corinthians 11:3ff).\nThe difference in roles or callings does not in any way change the status Christian men and Christian women have received from God. \u201cSo in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham\u2019s seed, and heirs according to the promise\u201d (Galatians 3:26-29). In God\u2019s kingdom there is perfect equality among his subjects.\nYour questions have received extensive treatment on this web site and in our church body\u2019s publications.

{"prompt": "Ministries that mislead", "completion": "Have you heard of \"119 Ministries\"?  It is leading Millennials away from the truth.  I just wanted to sound the alarm here!\n\n\nThe organization you referenced fails to recognize that Old Testament laws fell into different categories: civil, ceremonial and moral. As we are not citizens of Old Testament Israel, the civil laws given through Moses do not apply to us. The Old Testament ceremonial laws were meant for Old Testament Israel and had the purpose of pointing ahead to Jesus. When Jesus came and carried out his work, those laws were abolished. The tearing of the temple curtain on Good Friday illustrated that (Matthew 27:51). God\u2019s moral law remains for New Testament followers of the Lord. The moral law is God\u2019s will for all people of all time. The ten commandments serve as a nice summary of the moral law.\nThe chief purpose of God\u2019s law is to point out our sinfulness and show our need for a Savior. The organization you referenced places a different emphasis on the law and people\u2019s obedience of it. They state: \u201cOur obedience is the evidence and substance of our faith.\u201d\nThe organization you referenced has false ideas about the end times: multiple judgments before God and a literal millennium, for example.\nYour \u201csounding of the alarm\u201d is a good reminder and encouragement for Christians to \u201ctest the spirits\u201d (1 John 4:1) and to remain in Jesus\u2019 words (John 15:7)."}
{"prompt": "Living arrangements before marriage", "completion": "My boyfriend and I are planning to get married. He grew up Catholic but wants to become a WELS Lutheran like myself. We recently accepted a job together and the housing where the job is runs a little high. Is it okay to live together, in separate bedrooms, before we get married in the church?\n\n\nThe situation you describe is not okay.\u00a0 Allow me to explain why.\nRather than distancing yourself from temptations to engage in premarital sexual activity (1 Corinthians 6:18), by living together you would be putting those temptations in front of you and your boyfriend every day. If you think you would be able to withstand those temptations, Scripture offers a warning (1 Corinthians 10:12).\nEven if you did refrain from sexual activity in a live-in situation, you would have to ask yourself if your life were in line with the admonition that \u201camong you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality\u201d (Ephesians 5:3). Two people of the opposite sex living together create more than a hint.\nIn addition to thinking about yourself and your boyfriend, I encourage you to think of others. Have you taken into account what your parents think of this? While the fourth commandment changes in scope as parents and children grow older, the fourth commandment never disappears. Have you thought of how your actions might affect other family members, friends and acquaintances? Might your actions cause them to stumble spiritually (Matthew 18:6-7) and perhaps embolden others to follow your example? Love for God certainly drives our desire to live godly lives. Love for others is another strong motivator.\nI certainly do not have full knowledge of your situation and what other options for living arrangements you and your boyfriend might have. I encourage you to explore them. While financial considerations figure prominently in your question, I would remind you that God can have an entirely different economic system in taking care of his children (Matthew 6:33).\u00a0 We can do the right thing and trust that God will take care of us.\nIt is good to read that you and your boyfriend have thoughts of being one in the faith. You could be a real blessing to your boyfriend by explaining to him how maintaining separate living quarters at this stage of your life fits in with holy living (Romans 12:1). Let your light shine for him and others (Matthew 5:16).\nAs I do with so many questions, I\u2019ll wind up my response to you by encouraging you to speak to your pastor about this. Don\u2019t feel that this is a subject you can\u2019t address with him. He would be happy to provide scriptural guidance. God bless you."}

{"prompt": "Baptism in the name of Jesus", "completion": "I was talking to someone who said they go to the Jesus Church. He said that people in other churches are not baptized because the Bible says we need to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, and he gave me these verses from the Bible:  Acts 2:38, Acts 8:16, Acts 10:48, Acts 19:5, Romans 6:3, and Galatians 3:27.  I know that Jesus said to baptize in the name of the Father, Son , and Holy Spirit.  How can I explain these verses to him?\n\n\nAs you noted, Jesus instructed his followers to baptize \u201cin the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit\u201d (Matthew 28:19). Those are the words you will hear at Baptisms today.\nThe passages cited in your question do not tell us that the disciples baptized with different wording, substituting \u201cin the name of Jesus\u201d for \u201cin the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.\u201d The verses cited in your question speak of being baptized in the manner and by the authority of the one who instituted baptism: Jesus Christ. Describing Baptism \u201cin the name of Jesus Christ\u201d stresses the blessings that become one\u2019s own in Baptism: being clothed with the forgiveness of sins Jesus won by his holy life, sacrificial death and triumphant resurrection (Galatians 3:27).\nOn a side note, the Didache, an early second century A.D. writing, speaks of Baptism in the name of the Triune God. The writing provides historical evidence that the practice of the early church was in keeping with Jesus\u2019 instruction in Matthew 28:19."}

Thank you!\n\n\nWhile there are many details in Revelation chapter four\u2014some of which are easier to understand than others\u2014the overall meaning is that the apostle John was describing a vision of heaven that God granted him.\nIn the vision, John witnessed the majesty of God in heaven. He saw the faithful people of God standing in the presence of God. He observed God\u2019s creation giving continual, perfect praise to the Triune God.

{"prompt": "Jesus' descent into hell", "completion": "Professor Pope wrote in FIC this month teaching about Christ's time in the tomb. He said that Christ's soul went to heaven (paradise) immediately upon his death, while the corporeal body went into the grave. However, in the Creeds that we repeat every service we state that Christ descended into hell. The Small Catechism, section 143, also teaches the Jesus went to hell.\r\n\r\nMy question boils down to which teaching is correct? Both use the Scripture as supporting their statement. I am quite confused now though I thought I actually knew something. Please expound on the teaching.\n\n\nWhat I wrote in the Forward in Christ column and what we speak in the Creed are not at odds. Let me explain.\nDeath is the separation of body and soul (Ecclesiastes 12:7). When Jesus died, his body remained on earth, while his soul went to heaven (Luke 23:46). The same was true for the penitent thief on the cross (Luke 23:43).\nOn Easter Sunday morning Jesus\u2019 body and soul were reunited in Joseph\u2019s tomb. The Lord\u2014body and soul\u2014then descended into hell to declare his victory over Satan and his forces (1 Peter 3:18-20). After that, the risen Lord appeared to people here on earth.\nThe wording of the Apostles\u2019 Creed can make it seem like Jesus descended into hell before his body and soul were reunited. When the Creed states that Jesus \u201cdescended into hell,\u201d it is doing so on the basis that Jesus\u2019 body and soul had already been reunited in the tomb. When the Creed states that Jesus \u201crose again from the dead,\u201d it is referring to Jesus\u2019 appearances to people on earth. When we speak the words of the Apostles\u2019 Creed, we do not mean to say that Jesus descended into hell immediately after his death and burial.\nI hope this explanation removes some of the confusion."}
{"prompt": "Frequency of pastors receiving calls", "completion": "Why do some pastors get a call so frequently?\r\nThey get a call, turn it down, and then get another one like 4-6 months later? Seems to be too frequent.\n\n\nFrom a human perspective, pastors might receive calls frequently for a number of related reasons. They might be known for their God-given gifts and their faithfulness in using them. They might be blessed with a good reputation in the church. They might offer more visible service to the church at-large, so that others\u2014beyond the members of the congregation they serve\u2014are familiar with them and their ministries. Numerous other factors can enter into the equation as well.\nYour observation of the time frame of receiving calls approximates the practice of the Conference of Presidents. The general practice of the Conference of Presidents is that if a pastor has declined a call, he will not be eligible to receive another call for approximately six months. There can be exceptions, such as a pastor receiving a call to serve in a different type of ministry (a non-parish setting, for example). We make policies like these in Christian freedom, but at the same time we strive to maintain good order in the church (1 Corinthians 14:40).\nI can assure you that receiving a call to serve elsewhere can be an unsettling time in life. Then again, receiving a call to serve elsewhere provides a good opportunity for a pastor to evaluate his gifts and ministry, and prayerfully determine where those gifts can best be used at that time in life. Pastors, and other called workers, who are deliberating calls put great value in the prayers of fellow Christians. So when your pastor receives a call, pray that God would enable him to see clearly where he can best serve. Pray also that he will be at peace with the decision he makes. And if declines the call and receives another call some time later, offer similar prayers."}

However, becoming certified to officiate a wedding has made me nervous as all I've seen are some online free options that don't seem to align with WELS.  Does WELS offer anything to certify someone to officiate a wedding without being a pastor? Or would it be considered that I agree with all of the denomination's practices if I became certified through them?\n\n\nWELS does not offer certification to enable individuals to officiate at weddings.\nSince governments regulate marriage, governments also stipulate who can\u2014as agents of the government\u2014officiate at weddings. Regulations vary from state to state. Ordination is not always a requirement. You will want to find out the requirements of the state in which you live.\nYour concerns about the implications of being certified through an online ordination agency are valid. In short, online ordination is a caricature of what ordination really is.\nIf you were to take the place of an ordained pastor in officiating at the wedding of your relative, I wonder who would provide biblical pre-marital counseling for the prospective bride and groom. That counseling is so very important. Your pastor can provide guidance in this matter."}
{"prompt": "Heaven and hell in the Old Testament", "completion": "In the Old Testament it doesn't seem clear to me that there is a heaven and hell as distinctly referred to in the New Testament. The Old Testament refers to the dead going down to the pit and it is described almost as a place of nothingness or non-life.  It also doesn't seem like heaven is the clear goal as it does in the New Testament.  Can you share some insight on this please?\n\n\nYou are observing correctly that, with regard to hell, the Old Testament writers used words that could mean \u201cthe grave,\u201d \u201cthe condition of being dead\u201d and \u201chell.\u201d The immediate context determines how the words are best translated. Old Testament writers clearly taught that people who rejected the only true God and the Messiah he promised would experience God\u2019s eternal wrath (Isaiah 66:24; Daniel 12:2).\nAt the same time, Old Testament writers spoke of people enjoying God\u2019s eternal blessings through faith in him. The writers described heaven in different ways: being at God\u2019s right hand (Psalm 16:11), dwelling in the house of the Lord (Psalm 23:6), being with God in glory (Psalm 73:24), a place of joy (Isaiah 26:19) and the enjoyment of everlasting life (Daniel 12:1-3), for example.\nHeaven was definitely a clear goal in Old Testament times: on God\u2019s part and on the part of his followers. Consider how God, through the prophet Ezekiel, passionately and repeatedly expressed his desire to bless people with life rather than punish them for their sins (Ezekiel 18:23, 32; 33:11). Think of how Job \u201cyearned\u201d to see God after he died (Job 19:25-27).\nBecause of the unity of Scripture, you and I can see God\u2019s teaching about heaven and hell in both the Old Testament and the New Testament.\nIf you are interested in reading more explanations on these topics, Northwestern Publishing offers a book that is appropriately titled Heaven and Hell: Eternal Life, Eternal Punishment."}

{"prompt": "Luther and adoration of the sacrament", "completion": "Hi.  Is it true that Martin Luther approved adoration of host and even wrote book(s) to support that practice?\r\n\n\n\nVolume 36 of Luther\u2019s Works, American Edition, contains Martin Luther\u2019s writing on \u201cThe Adoration of the Sacrament\u201d (pages 275-305). The writing is from April 1523.\nThe writing was occasioned by several factors. One was that people were misrepresenting Luther\u2019s views on the Lord\u2019s Supper in a previous work, The Babylonian Captivity of the Church. Another factor was that Luther was in contact with the Bohemian Brethren, who rejected the adoration.\nAs you might expect, Luther appealed to Christian freedom in this area. \u201cWe say now that one should not condemn people or accuse them of heresy if they do not adore the sacrament, for there is no command to that effect and it is not for that purpose that Christ is present. Just as we read that the apostles did not adore the sacrament since they were sitting and eating at table. On the other hand, one should not condemn and accuse of heresy people who do adore the sacrament. For although Christ has not commanded it, neither has he forbidden it, but often accepted it [that is, he accepted it when people bowed to him]. Free, free it must be, according as one is disposed in his heart and has opportunity.\u201d\nWhen Luther wrote about freedom like this, he was speaking of what actions Christians might make during their reception of the Lord\u2019s Supper. What Luther rejected was the adoration of the sacrament outside the distribution and reception of the Lord\u2019s Supper\u2014as in Corpus Christi processions.\nWhile Luther acknowledged Christian freedom in how communicants might acknowledge the Lord\u2019s presence in the sacrament, he was concerned that people\u2019s actions might detract from the Lord\u2019s actions in the sacrament: offering forgiveness of sins, life and salvation. That is why he wrote: \u201cNevertheless, you can see that adoration of this sacrament is a dangerous procedure if the Word and faith are not inculcated; so much so that I really think it would be better to follow the example of the apostles and not worship, than to follow our custom and worship. Not that adoration is wrong, but simply because there is less danger in not adoring than in adoring; because human nature tends so easily to emphasize its own works and to neglect God\u2019s work, and the sacrament will not admit of that\u2026the thing that we emphasize as of the utmost importance is faith in the words of the sacrament.\u201d\nAs is the case with other topics, we regard Martin Luther\u2019s comments and thoughts on this subject as insightful, but Scripture alone is the source of our faith. I add that thought since you indicated you are not affiliated with a Lutheran church."}
{"prompt": "Joining another denomination to support my future husband", "completion": "I am about as WELS as you can get in my generation, on the older end of \"millennials.\" I attended a WELS grade school, and have regularly attended WELS churches my entire life. However, in a couple months' time, I will be marrying a man of another denomination, and who is currently in seminary school to become a pastor in that denomination. It is a Christian denomination that teaches the saving faith in Christ alone, yet its doctrine can be described as on shifting sand. My fiance is more faithful to Christ than any man I've ever met. He is conservative, and our views largely align - and even most doctrinal views align.  It has been difficult, but I do plan to convert from the WELS to his denomination. However, my heart is with the WELS, because it is through its pastors and teachers that I know of Christ's saving faith. I will always be Lutheran at heart, but more importantly I will always be a Christian at heart. Is it wrong to convert because I do not fully adhere to the doctrine of my future husband's denomination? I want to convert, because I want support him in the church, and I pray that I will be more of Christ's tool in his denomination because of the firm foundation that the WELS has given me. But an even deeper question presents, does converting essentially slap the vow I made at confirmation in the face? I identify as a Wisconsin Synod Lutheran, but first I am a Christian, who believes in the Triune God and who wants to fully support my soon-to-be-husband as I've seen so many WELS pastors' wives do throughout my life. Any insight into my difficult situation would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!\n\n\nI agree that you are in a challenging situation. Since I do not know with which denomination you are thinking of affiliating, I cannot speak about the steps you would take to join a congregation of that denomination or what the process is like.\nOn the other hand, you and I do know what happens when people desire to become communicant members of our churches. In the case of confirmation, people state publicly that the teachings they have learned from the Bible are true. In the case of people joining one of our congregations by the route of profession of faith or affirmation of faith, people declare that the teachings of the church as presented to them are biblical and that the teachings reflect their faith. Through these routes that people take to become communicant members of our churches, their membership is a public confession of their faith to other people; their membership implies that their faith is aligned with the teachings of the church to which they belong. Church membership is important because it is a tangible way of doing what Jesus said: \u201cacknowledging him before others\u201d (Matthew 10:32).\nWhen people have membership in a church but have personal beliefs that differ from that church, they send inconsistent messages: the person\u2019s confession of faith says one thing, but the person\u2019s membership in a church says something else (that he or she believes what the church teaches).\nWith your situation, you have told me that your faith represents the teachings of WELS from Scripture. To join a congregation in a denomination that has its doctrine on \u201cshifting sand\u201d would send the signal to others that your faith embraces the doctrine of that church. There would be inconsistency in the confessions of faith you would be making\u2014personally and through your membership.\nAs the vows for confirmation are not necessarily identical in all our churches, I am not sure what the specific wording was for your vows. Generally, confirmands declare their acceptance of the canonical books of the Bible; they promise, with God\u2019s help and strength, to remain strong in the confession of the Evangelical Lutheran Church; and, they state their intention, also with God\u2019s help and strength, to live a Christian life and to use faithfully the means of grace to remain a life-long child of God. Joining a denomination with doctrine based on \u201cshifting sand\u201d would imply that a person has embraced the confession of that church.\nI understand that it is your desire to support your husband and his future ministry that is the driving force to join his denomination. I imagine you need to ask yourself what level of support will be offered if your personal confession of faith does not match the confession of faith stated by your church membership. Will doctrinal differences be disruptive rather than supportive in your family life or your congregational life? I realize the same question could be asked if you marry and retain your WELS membership. This is why I began my response by acknowledging your challenging situation.\nI trust you have spoken to your parents about this and your fianc\u00e9 has done the same with his parents. I trust also you are sorting out all this with your conscience in mind. If you haven\u2019t already done so, do speak to your WELS pastor about your situation. He is in a much better position than I to offer specific help, but I hope I have at least provided the requested insight. God bless you."}

But does mean we are required to express hatred toward them and/or make bigoted and prejudiced statements about them? I do not believe all Muslims are terrorists. I don't believe all Muslim men beat their wives. Yet, I often hear fellow WELS Christians making these types of sweeping generalizations. I do not feel these statements show Christian love. I don't think the Bible directs us to make such statements against any unbeliever. Aren't we supposed to \"speak the truth in love\" to unbelievers? What is the appropriate response to these types of statements?\n\n\nYou have a correct understanding. \u201cSpeaking the truth in love\u201d applies to our conversations to fellow Christians and those outside the faith.\nWhen fellow Christians stereotype people of a false religion, you can remind them that those people too were the object of God\u2019s love when he sent Jesus into the world on his saving mission (John 3:16). You can remind fellow Christians that the following Scripture passages apply also to Muslims: \u201cThe Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance\u201d (2 Peter 3:9). \u201cThis is good, and pleases God our Savior, who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth. For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all people\u201d (1 Timothy 2:3-6).\nPeople who presently reject Jesus Christ as their Savior are outside the kingdom of God. If people die without faith in Jesus in their hearts, they will spend eternity apart from God (Mark 16:16). Compassion for the lost (for example, Romans 9:3), will lead us to pray for their conversion and to support the worldwide spread of the gospel, so that the Holy Spirit can change the hearts and lives of more and more people.\nFinally, speaking God\u2019s truth can include the identification and rejection of ungodly actions and attitudes. Our Lord did that during his ministry (cf. Matthew 23). However, we will let God be the judge of people\u2019s hearts.\nThe quotation in your question reminds me of a good book that was written on this subject: Speaking the Truth in Love to Muslims. Your church library may have a copy. If not, it is available through Northwestern Publishing House. Perhaps you and others might also benefit from a Light for our path column that previously addressed a question like yours. I commend that for your reading. I commend you also for the concern you have for fellow Christians\u2019 attitudes toward the lost."}

It is God who knows all things (Job 34:21; Psalm 139:1-4; 147:5; Hebrews 4:13; 1 John 3:20).

{"prompt": "Being \"poor in spirit\"", "completion": "I think in the sermon on the mount Jesus states:  \"Blessed are the poor in spirit.\"  What does poor in spirit mean?\n\n\nThe expression you have in mind is how Jesus began the sermon on the mount: \u201cBlessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven\u201d (Matthew 5:3).\nBeing poor \u201cin spirit\u201d is different than being poor \u201cin body.\u201d The later kind of poverty exists when there is not enough money to make ends meet. Being \u201cpoor in spirit\u201d is another kind of poverty. That poverty is one directly involving the soul; it is one of attitudes and beliefs.\nWhen people are \u201cpoor in spirit,\u201d they have right attitudes about themselves and God. They know and confess that they are sinners who cannot give anything to God for which he is obligated to repay them (Romans 11:35). When people are poor in spirit, they recognize and confess to God that they lack the perfection and holiness he demands of them (Luke 18:13). When people are poor in spirit, they do not approach God with their hands figuratively filled with their good deeds as if God should be impressed. No, it is just the opposite. The hymn writer put it this way: \u201cNothing in my hand I bring, Simply to thy cross I cling\u201d (Christian Worship 389:3).\nSimply confessing sins will not save anyone, but remember the audience in the sermon on the mount. The Lord was speaking to his followers, people who already were in the faith. To people who were poor in spirit and whose hearts were filled with repentance and faith in the promised Savior, the Lord could promise: \u201ctheirs is the kingdom of heaven\u201d (Matthew 5:3).\nAfter Martin Luther died, people discovered a scrap of paper in one of his pockets that had this message: \u201cThis is true. We are all beggars.\u201d Christians are beggars. Through the Holy Spirit\u2019s work in their hearts, Christians are \u201cpoor in spirit.\u201d But through faith in Jesus, Christians enjoy the \u201criches of God\u2019s grace\u201d (Ephesians 1:7). Those who are poor before God are rich beyond measure!"}
{"prompt": "Morality and sin", "completion": "We are all sinful by nature. Does this mean none of us is moral? Can one person be more moral than someone else in the eyes of God?\n\n\nA common definition of \u201cmoral\u201d is \u201cconforming to the rules of right conduct.\u201d An appropriate question would be: \u201cWho sets those rules of right conduct?\u201d Is it society? Government? God?\nYou are correct: we are all sinful by nature (Psalm 51:5; John 3:5-6). By nature and apart from Christian faith, no one can do anything pleasing in God\u2019s sight (Romans 14:23; Hebrews 11:6). It does not matter if some unbelievers are more morally upright than other unbelievers. All are sinners by nature and by their own doing in God\u2019s sight (Romans 3:23). His \u201crules of right conduct\u201d demand perfection. Because God\u2019s law is a unit, the breaking of just one of his commands is a violation of all of them (James 2:10-11).\nThankfully, Jesus was our perfect substitute in life. While we rightfully focus on the Lord\u2019s passive obedience during the Lenten season, we do well to focus on Jesus\u2019 active obedience in every season of life. What you and I could not do in keeping God\u2019s law perfectly all the time, Jesus did (Hebrews 4:15; 1 Peter 2:22).\nEven now as children of God through faith in Jesus Christ, we do not conform to God\u2019s \u201crules of right conduct.\u201d While the sanctified lives of some Christians may outshine the lives of other Christians, it is only through the merits of Jesus Christ that any of their good deeds are acceptable to God (Isaiah 64:6; Ephesians 2:10; Philippians 2:13).\nWith this understanding, let\u2019s continue living for him who died for us and was raised again (2 Corinthians 5:15)!"}
{"prompt": "Christian Reformed Church schools", "completion": "Please help me understand the beliefs of the Christian Reformed Church or CRC denomination.  They af\ufb01rm three creeds\u2014the Apostles\u2019 Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed\u2014as ecumenical expressions of the Christian faith.  OK.  They also af\ufb01rm three confessions\u2014the Belgic Confession, the Heidelberg Catechism, and the Canons of Dort.  Please help!  Their churches often support well regarded Christian day schools, and while WELS is not in fellowship with CRC, I'm wondering if CRC schools are an appropriate alternative to public schools.\n\n\nAs the three creeds\u2014the Apostles\u2019 Creed, the Nicene Creed and the Athanasian Creed\u2014are called ecumenical creeds, one would expect a church like the Christian Reformed Church to subscribe to them. But because those creeds speak of the Christian faith in general terms, it is necessary and worthwhile that Christian churches have other confessions that spell out their beliefs and practices. That is the purpose of the three confessions you listed.\nThe three confessions\u2014the Belgic Confession, the Heidelberg Catechism and the Canons of Dort\u2014state classic Calvinistic doctrine with which we would disagree. The confessions speak of double predestination, limited atonement, irresistible grace, the perseverance of the saints, and the denial of baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper as means of grace, among other things. Enrollment of our children in schools that teach false doctrine would be confusing, at least, and harmful, at most, to their faith and spiritual lives. I would encourage the exploration of other options."}

{"prompt": "Satan's presence in Eden", "completion": "Why was the devil (as a snake) in the Garden of Eden?\n\n\nHe was there to try to rob Adam and Eve of their perfect life with God (John 8:44). As a fallen angel doomed to eternal separation from God in hell (2 Peter 2:4), Satan\u2019s motto is \u201cmisery loves company.\u201d His mission is to get as many people as possible to share in his fate (1 Peter 5:8).\nHow thankful we are that Jesus came to defeat the devil (1 John 3:8). In the Garden of Eden God prophesied that victory (Genesis 3:15). Jesus fulfilled that prophecy when he resisted all of Satan\u2019s temptations, paid the penalty of sin on the cross and rose triumphantly on Easter Sunday.\nCrushed but not yet out of commission, Satan remains our enemy.

{"prompt": "Doctrine and truth", "completion": "What is doctrine? Is doctrine absolute truth? Thank you.\n\n\nDoctrine is defined as \u201csomething that is taught.\u201d In the context of the Bible, doctrine is what the Bible teaches about any number of subjects. Whatever the Bible\u2019s teaching may be, it is true; it is always true.\nWhen it comes to what people teach from the Bible, there is true or sound doctrine, and there is false doctrine. That explains why we see in the Bible God giving instructions like these to those who minister on his behalf: \u201cWatch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers\u201d (1 Timothy 4:16). \u201cFor the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear\u201d (2 Timothy 4:3). \u201cHe must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it\u201d (Titus 1:9). \u201cYou, however, must teach what is appropriate to sound doctrine\u201d (Titus 2:1)."}
{"prompt": "\"Glory\" in the Lord's Prayer", "completion": "In the Lord's Prayer we pray \"for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory.\" What is meant by glory?\n\n\nThe words you are referencing are from the Doxology of the Lord\u2019s Prayer. Doxology means \u201can expression of praise to God.\u201d When we give praise to God, we give him glory (Psalm 115:1).\nThe following Scripture verse illustrates the nature of a doxology: \u201cYours, LORD, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the majesty and the splendor, for everything in heaven and earth is yours. Yours, LORD, is the kingdom; you are exalted as head over all\u201d (1 Chronicles 29:11).\nWe close the Lord\u2019s Prayer, then, by giving glory and praise to our Father in heaven."}
{"prompt": "Salvation only through Jesus", "completion": "The pastor said at our Lutheran church (that I like to attend):  \"It's hard when a non-Christian dies.  At the funeral, it's said he/she is going to a better place,\" but, he said, \"He/she is not.\"  What does he mean? Surely he can't mean that all non-Christians go to hell. A loving God would not create us to send us to hell for not having heard of Jesus. To simply say, go and spread the good news, makes the salvation of others dependent upon me, a mortal. That makes no sense! Plus, I don't think God would send all North Koreans, for example, to hell (and it's a totally closed society so no chance of spreading any news there). What am I missing? \n\n\nYour pastor was stating what Jesus said: \u201cI am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me\u201d (John 14:6). Jesus is not one of many ways to the Father. He is the only way. The Bible also says about Jesus: \u201cSalvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved\u201d (Acts 4:12). Jesus is the only Savior.\nIn addition, Jesus said: \u201cWhoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned\u201d (Mark 16:16). Faith in Jesus saves. Without faith in Jesus, people stand to be condemned.\nWhen it comes to your thoughts about people\u2019s opportunities to hear the gospel, let me pass along the response from one of my predecessors in this position to a similar question.\n\u201cThe natural knowledge of God gives everyone powerful witness about his existence. All creation shouts to all with eyes and ears that one great Creator exists (Psalm 19:1-4; Romans 1:20). Man\u2019s accusing conscience also testifies powerfully to his responsibility to his Creator (Romans 2:14,15). Although such natural knowledge cannot tell anyone this Creator\u2019s exact identity, it should lead people to \u2018seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us\u2019 (Acts 17:27).\n\u201cSadly, \u2018there is no one who understands, no one who seeks God\u2019 (Romans 3:11). Therefore, \u2018the wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness, since what may be known about God is plain to them\u2019 (Romans 1:18,19). Stubborn rejection of that natural knowledge leaves all without excuse. God is just in judging those in Old or New Testament times who never heard his gospel.\n\u201cYet God has also shown himself zealous to spread that only message that saves man from his well-deserved plight. At least twice in Old Testament history everyone knew the gospel. After Adam and Eve\u2019s fall, God revealed the promise of the woman\u2019s offspring who would crush the serpent\u2019s head (Genesis 3:15). However, as generations passed the vast majority rejected that promise.\n\u201cConsider also God\u2019s patient mercy at Noah\u2019s time. God spoke to all who would listen through that \u2018preacher of righteousness\u2019 (2 Peter 2:5). Then, when judgment reduced the world\u2019s population to eight, again all knew the true God\u2019s promised salvation. Yet once again the vast majority threw away that knowledge.\n\u201cGod has continued his persistence in New Testament times. For all the book of Acts tells us, it tells us little about any apostles other than Peter and Paul. From Paul\u2019s letters, it\u2019s clear that Acts doesn\u2019t record even all of Paul\u2019s travels. The missionary zeal of many early Christians and the pages of church history testify to a rapid spread of the gospel. Yet over the centuries, in many places where the gospel was richly abundant, man\u2019s callousness led to a loss of the gospel.\n\u201cHuman nature blames God\u2014as if he\u2019s somehow unjust in condemning an unbelieving world. Yet consider history\u2019s tragic tale. God zealously hunts down sinful mankind with his gospel. Sinful people zealously refuse to be found, or once found, often run back into darkness.\n\u201cThere is no other way of salvation. We cannot quiet this concern by suggesting that perhaps there\u2019s some other way God will save those not won by the gospel. Other than Jesus there is \u201cno other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved\u201d (Acts 4:12). There is no other way to come to faith in that gospel. \u2018Faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ\u2019 (Romans 10:17).\n\u201cLet\u2019s not waste our energy wondering if God will judge those who die without the gospel. He will, with no apologies! Rather, let\u2019s take the challenge God lays before every generation of his children\u2014to spread the powerful gospel message with every ounce of our energy and with every resource at our disposal.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Partaking of the Lord's Supper", "completion": "I am not married, currently pregnant and staying with my partner.  Am I allowed to partake of the Lord's Supper?\n\n\nI would advise you to refrain from receiving the Lord\u2019s Supper at this time. Why? In the Bible God warns against receiving the sacrament \u201cin an unworthy manner\u201d (1 Corinthians 11:27). Unworthily reception takes place when individuals have wrong attitudes toward sin, the sacrament or Jesus. In your situation, living together without being legally married and engaging in sexual relations goes against God\u2019s will (1 Corinthians 6:18; 1 Thessalonians 4:3; Hebrews 13:4). Your situation calls for repentance and fruits of repentance.\nThe message of the Bible is that \u201cIf we confess our sins, he [God] is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness\u201d (1 John 1:9). God be praised when he leads people to confess as David did: \u201cI have sinned against the Lord.\u201d God be praised for his gospel message, which assures repentant sinners: \u201cThe Lord has taken away your sin.\u201d (2 Samuel 12:13)\nYou do not mention if your pastor is aware of your situation, but you will want to speak with him. God grant you repentant and faith-filled hearts. I encourage you to adopt the attitudes and to take the actions necessary so you are able to be a guest at the Lord\u2019s Supper."}
{"prompt": "WELS and Bible translations", "completion": "So, I'm doing research because I want to become a Lutheran pastor.

How can you, as a conservative, confessional synod, accept that?\n\n\nWhat you found is not the complete picture on Bible translations and WELS. Allow me to pass along information from the 2015 Book of Reports and Memorials. This information was published in connection with our 2015 Synod Convention. The report from Northwestern Publishing House (NPH) included the following:\n\u201cNPH continues to pursue an \u2018eclectic approach,\u2019 as directed by synod resolution, utilizing the best translation for the context of any given work. In recent months NPH has faced challenges and opportunities in fulfilling this direction.\n\u201cZondervan has asked NPH to discontinue use of NIV84 going forward. All works currently in development or already in print with NIV84 may contain the translation. However, no future works can include NIV84. NPH will utilize NIV11 in the future as one translation option. NPH will also utilize the English Standard Version (ESV) and the Holman Christian Standard Bible (HCSB) as translation options. We anticipate revisions to the HCSB as a result of the recommendations submitted by the WELS Translation Liaison Committee.\n\u201cSelected from among other potential publishers, an agreement was reached between the Wartburg Project and NPH to print and distribute the Wartburg Project Bible translation. As translation work continues by the Wartburg Project, it is anticipated that a New Testament and Psalms edition will be ready for release in fall 2017. A complete Bible will be introduced at a future date yet to be determined.\n\u201cNPH has not and will not participate in the translation or editing work involved in the Wartburg Project translation. Although NPH will publish the Wartburg Project translation, it will not be the official NPH translation or sole Bible translation offered by NPH or utilized in NPH materials.

{"prompt": "The \"holy angel\" in prayers", "completion": "Who is \"your holy angel\" in Luther's morning/evening prayer ?\n\n\nThe holy angels are those angels who did not join in with Satan and other angels in rebelling against God (2 Peter 2:4). The holy angels are \u201cministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation\u201d (Hebrews 1:14). The holy angels carry out God\u2019s command \u201cto guard you in all your ways\u201d (Psalm 91:11). The \u201choly angel\u201d in Martin Luther\u2019s prayers references any of the heavenly host whom God might choose to use to carry out his good and gracious will in our lives. Might God use a single angel on occasion? Yes. Might he use more than one angel on occasion? Yes.\nThe Bible does not state specifically that God has assigned a guardian angel to each Christian. While it would be comforting to know that God has matched one angel to us for life-time service and protection, it is even more comforting to know that God employs angels\u2014plural\u2014in his providential care of each Christian.\nGod\u2019s gracious use of angels in our lives provides another reason for praising God. \u201cLord God, to you we all give praise; To you our joyful hymns we raise That angel hosts you did create Around your glorious throne to wait. But watchful is the angel band That follows Christ on ev\u2019ry hand To guard his people where they go And break the counsel of the foe.

{"prompt": "Why be a Christian?", "completion": "Why should I be a Christian? Does Christianity provide answers to life? Would another religion provide answers to life? Is there any purpose to Christianity besides avoiding hellfire?\n\n\nWhy be a Christian? In spite of the false messages that permeate our world (that all religions lead to that same wonderful place, or that a loving God would never punish people eternally in hell), only Christianity provides a Savior from sin. Jesus said: \u201cI am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me\u201d (John 14:6). There is only one Savior and it is Jesus Christ.\nIf we need more incentive than the assurance of eternal life to follow Jesus Christ in faith, then we can keep in mind that: only Christians can go through life with God\u2019s assurance that they are at peace with him through the forgiveness of sins (Romans 5:1-2); only Christians have God\u2019s assurance that they enjoy his powerful love now and in eternity (Romans 8:28-39); only Christians have God\u2019s assurance that they are members of his family (1 John 3:1-2); only Christians have God\u2019s assurance that he will hear and answer their prayers (1 Kings 18:16-40; Psalm 34:15-16; Proverbs 15:29).

{"prompt": "Lord's Prayer Doxology", "completion": "I've done some research on why we include the \"long ending\" to the Lord's Prayer. I'm writing an article about this and want to make sure I state things as \"WELS accurate.\" :)\r\nSpecifically, why don't Catholics include it and others do? I read one response that said at the time of the Reformation it was added so the Catholic church, not wanting to identify with Luther et al, made the decision to not include it when said during mass.\n\n\nWe find the Lord speaking the prayer that bears his name twice: in the sermon on the mount (Matthew 6:9-13) and on the occasion of his disciples asking for guidance on how to pray (Luke 11:2-4). The reality we face is that the original manuscripts of Matthew\u2019s gospel and Luke\u2019s gospel are not extant. That is the case with all original manuscripts of Bible books. We have copies and copies of the original manuscripts.\nThe copies of Luke\u2019s gospel do not contain a doxology. Some copies of Matthew\u2019s gospel contain a doxology, other copies do not. Consequently, we cannot say with certainty whether or not Jesus spoke the doxology.\nIn that regard, then, it is not a matter of right or wrong to speak or omit the doxology. Churches have freedom in which \u201cversion\u201d they use. If Jesus did not speak the doxology, those words that are reminiscent of 1 Chronicles 29:10-11 could very well have been a liturgical addition by the early Christian church. Our Holy Communion liturgy from the 1941 hymnal reflected that when the pastor spoke the address and petitions of the Lord\u2019s Prayer and the congregation sang the Doxology.\nIt is interesting to note that the Small and Large Catechisms that Martin Luther wrote contained the Lord\u2019s Prayer without the Doxology. The Doxology was added to the Catechisms after Luther\u2019s death. Also, when Luther revised the Mass, he included an instruction that \u201cAfter the sermon shall follow a public paraphrase of the Lord\u2019s Prayer.\u201d That paraphrase did not include a Doxology.\nGod\u2019s blessings on your writing!"}
{"prompt": "LGBT individuals and church membership", "completion": "Does the WELS church accept LGBT individuals as members?  Are they able to take Communion?\n\n\nAs your question has been asked more than once, allow me to pass along a previous response:\n\u201cIt depends on what the question implies. Could a church member experience homosexual feelings or temptation? The answer is yes. Our society loves to debate whether an inclination toward homosexuality is due to hereditary or environmental factors, but this is utterly beside the point. The devil, the world, and our inherited sinful nature assault each one of us in different ways. One believer struggles with gambling, another with alcohol, another with a quick temper, another with indifference toward those in need, etc. The fact that a person experiences temptation in one form and not in another does not put him or her out of the kingdom of God.\n\u201cIs it possible for a church member to stumble and fall into the sin of homosexuality? The answer again is yes. Scripture does not classify sinful actions into \u2018sins that believers commit\u2019 and \u2018sins that only unbelievers commit.\u2019 The fact that someone sinned sexually with a person of the same gender does not, all by itself, mean that the person isn\u2019t a believer, any more than would an act of heterosexual immorality, drunkenness, reckless driving, or cheating on one\u2019s taxes.\n\u201cCan a person remain a practicing homosexual in defiance of God\u2019s Word and also be a believing member of the church? The answer is no. Believers agree that what God calls \u2018sin\u2019 is sin. They turn from their sin, receive God\u2019s forgiveness, and battle against the sin in their lives with the help of God\u2019s Holy Spirit.\n\u201c1 Corinthians 6:9,10 are perhaps the key passages on this subject in Scripture. First, note that it includes homosexuality in a catalogue of other sins, with no indication that it is any worse (or any less bad) than greed, slander, or cheating someone. Then, speaking to Christians, Paul says, \u2018That is what some of you were\u2019 (1 Corinthians 6:11). The past tense is significant.\u201d\nYou might also be interested in reading this statement on homosexuality."}
{"prompt": "Indwelling of the Holy Spirit", "completion": "How does the Holy Spirit dwell in us?\n\n\nThe Holy Spirit dwells in Christians through the saving faith he created in their hearts by the gospel. When God brings people to faith, he does so through his Holy Spirit, \u201cwhom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior\u201d (Titus 3:6).\nTwice in his first letter to the Corinthians the apostle Paul asked a question that reminds Christians that the Holy Spirit lives in them. \u201cDon\u2019t you know that you yourselves are God\u2019s temple and that God\u2019s Spirit dwells in your midst?\u201d (1 Corinthians 3:16) \u201cDo you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God?\u201d (1 Corinthians 6:19)\nThe same apostle reminds us that the indwelling of the Holy Spirit signifies God\u2019s ownership of us: \u201cAnd you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God\u2019s possession\u2014to the praise of his glory\u201d (Ephesians 1:13-14).\nHere are a few other passages that speak of the Holy Spirit dwelling in Christians: \u201cNow it is God who makes both us and you stand firm in Christ. He anointed us, set his seal of ownership on us, and put his Spirit in our hearts as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come\u201d (2 Corinthians 1:21-22). \u201cBecause you are his sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, \u2018Abba, Father\u2019\u201d (Galatians 4:6). \u201cAnd in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit\u201d (Ephesians 2:22). \u201cThe one who keeps God\u2019s commands lives in him, and he in them. And this is how we know that he lives in us: We know it by the Spirit he gave us\u201d (1 John 3:24)."}
{"prompt": "Christians and the death penalty", "completion": "Should a Christian support the death penalty?   \n\n\nGod has given his representatives in government the right to exercise the death penalty if they so choose (Romans 13:4). Christians who live in a state or country where the government carries out capital punishment will want to recognize that their government has authority from God to punish criminals that way. Christians who live in a state or country where the government punishes by incarceration instead of the death penalty will want to recognize that their government has authority from God to punish criminals that way. While God allows for governments to punish criminals by means of the death penalty, he does not command that they do so. Governmental leaders can decide by law how, and to what degree, they will punish criminals.\nChristians will abide by the laws of their state or country, unless such laws contradict God\u2019s word (Acts 5:29)."}
{"prompt": "Ash Wednesday ashes", "completion": "Where in the Bible can I find out about ashes on Ash Wednesday?\n\n\nWhile you will find references to \u201cashes\u201d in the Bible, you will of course not find any mention of Ash Wednesday. Christians have, in God-given freedom, established a church calendar, including Ash Wednesday.\nAs a church custom, the imposition of ashes (as it is called) is an adiaphoron. God has not commanded it nor forbidden it. In Christian freedom, we may utilize the practice or forego it. The custom of putting ashes on the foreheads of Christians on Ash Wednesday has been in use for centuries. While it is a practice that many still associate only with Roman Catholicism, it has grown in popularity with Protestant churches in recent years.\nThe purpose of imposing ashes on the foreheads of worshipers on Ash Wednesday is to have a visual reminder that the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23), and death means our bodies return to dust from which Adam was made (Genesis 3:19). As ashes are biblical pictures of repentance (Job 42:6; Matthew 11:21), the use of ashes eventually became associated with Lent, a penitential season of the church year. When the ashes form the shape of a cross on the foreheads of worshipers, there is also a visible reminder for others about the precious cross of Christ. If practical, this year\u2019s palm fronds from Palm Sunday worship services are burned to become ashes for next year\u2019s Ash Wednesday observance."}

What you want to do, then, is put your friend in touch with God\u2019s word and let the Holy Spirit take over.\nWhat you want your friend to understand first is that God\u2019s word is truthful in whatever it says (John 17:17). Again, that is a conviction of the heart that only God can bring about. You can pray that God will convince your friend of the truth as she comes into contact with his word.\nAs far as resources are concerned, you might be interested in reading our church body\u2019s statement on homosexuality.

{"prompt": "Difference between Baptism and Jewish washings", "completion": "Help me clearly explain a Christian Baptism versus Jewish tevilah.\n\n\nThe difference is that one is a one-time, faith-working act on God\u2019s part (Baptism), while the other speaks of ritualistic, ceremonial purifications that people perform (Jewish tevilah).\nBaptism joins people to Jesus in faith and gives them the blessings he won by his holy life, sacrificial death and glorious resurrection (Romans 6:3; Galatians 3:27). In Baptism God offers and gives people the forgiveness of sins (Acts 2:38; 22:16). Jewish ritual washings did not have those purposes; they were ceremonial washings only."}
{"prompt": "Judas' betrayal of Jesus", "completion": "Why did God choose Judas to betray Jesus?\n\n\nJesus\u2019 foreknowledge that Judas would betray him (for example, Matthew 26:21-25) does not mean that Judas was chosen or forced to betray Jesus. There is a difference between foreknowledge and foreordaining. While the Lord knew what was going to happen, and while he was going to use that event for his plans, he did not force the event to take place.\nI have these notes written down from a seminary class from years ago: \u201cThe foreknowledge of God does not bring necessity to the event. It only means God knows what is going to happen. As our memory of past events does not necessitate an event, so God\u2019s knowledge of future events does not necessitate an event. Our knowledge of when the next lunar eclipse is going to take place does not make it happen. The foreknowledge depends on the event; the event does not depend on the foreknowledge.\u201d\nFinally, it is helpful to keep in mind how Jesus addressed Judas at the time of the betrayal:\u00a0 \u201cFriend\u201d (Matthew 26:50)."}

{"prompt": "Christian hedonism", "completion": "Could you please provide a biblical evaluation of John Piper's Christian hedonism?\n\n\nI do not have any review to which I can point you, so let me offer a brief response.\n\u201cHedonism\u201d is usually defined as the idea that \u201cpleasure or happiness is the highest good in life.\u201d If you are thinking that sounds like the ancient Greek philosophy of Epicureanism, you are on the right track.\n\u201cHow can there be something called \u2018Christian hedonism?'\u201d you ask. That is what John Piper tries to explain. He summarizes Christian hedonism this way: \u201cGod is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him.\u201d On his web site he maintains: \u201cChristian hedonism is biblical morality because it recognizes that obeying God is the only route to final and lasting happiness\u201d [original emphasis]. To me, that is the crux of the problem: happiness depends on me and my obedience to the law of God.\nCertainly, God promises to bless faithfulness on the part of his children (Matthew 5:3-10; Luke 6:38, for example), but the only route to final and lasting joy is through the gospel: the message that God has provided free and full salvation through his Son, Jesus Christ (John 3:16).\nTo me, glorifying God puts the emphasis on God (Revelation 14:7), not me and my efforts to obtain happiness.\nFinally, it is helpful to know that Piper embraces Calvinist theology."}
{"prompt": "God the Holy Spirit", "completion": "Is there any scriptural evidence that says the Holy Spirit is a separate person from God the Father? What if the Holy Spirit is actually God the Father's soul, therefore the same person? \r\n \n\n\nContrary to what a religion like the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses teaches, the Bible speaks of the Holy Spirit being a separate person of the Trinity.\nI would encourage you to look up Bible passages like these: Matthew 3:16-17; 12:31-32; 28:19; John 14:16; 15:26; 2 Corinthians 13:14.\nThe Athanasian Creed states biblical truth when it says: \u201cWe worship one God in three persons and three persons in one God, without mixing the persons or dividing the divine being. For each person\u2014the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit\u2014is distinct, but the deity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is one, equal in glory and coeternal in majesty\u2026So the Father is God, the Son is God, the Holy Spirit is God; yet they are not three Gods, but one God. So the Father is Lord, the Son is Lord, the Holy Spirit is Lord; yet they are not three Lords, but one Lord\u2026The Holy Spirit is neither made nor created nor begotten, but proceeds from the Father and the Son.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Infant Communion", "completion": "Has there ever been a time in the history of the Lutheran church that babies or young children were given Communion?   \n\n\nThat practice has been the exception not the norm. When it comes to Lutheran church bodies in the United States, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) allows its congregations the flexibility to adopt and implement that practice.\nWhile Scripture of course does not designate a specific age when people can begin receiving the Lord\u2019s Supper, it does provide guidance and rationale for not communing the very young. \u201cSo then, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. Everyone ought to examine themselves before they eat of the bread and drink from the cup. For those who eat and drink without discerning the body of Christ eat and drink judgment on themselves\u201d (1 Corinthians 11:27-29). Our historic practice of youth Confirmation and Holy Communion reception has those Bible verses in mind."}
{"prompt": "Presidential election aftermath", "completion": "I am struggling with the current United States president.  I have always respected our political process and voted my conscience.  I see the unrest and apparent bigotry of the current administration and their appointees. I know that we are all sinful but it seems to me that Jesus led by example to feed the poor and care for the sick. How can we support someone who seems so unchristian in his attitude and policies?  Are we expected to support the Republican Party simply because they don't believe in abortion, regardless of how they act in so many other areas?\n\n\nAfter every election there are happy and unhappy people: the candidates and their supporters. After every election there are opportunities for those who won and those who lost to be gracious and kind to each other. After every election there are occasions for us to remember not only the eighth commandment but the fourth commandment.\nThe fourth commandment teaches us that God has representatives in three areas of our lives: the home, the church and the government. It goes without saying that God\u2019s representatives in all these areas may represent him well, or they may misrepresent him. God\u2019s will is that we honor him by honoring and respecting his representatives (Colossians 3:20; Hebrews 13:7, 17; Romans 13:7). God\u2019s will is that we obey his representatives\u2014unless they command a course of action that is contrary to what God says in his word (Acts 5:29).\u00a0 If we disagree with a person in office or the person\u2019s policies, we can express that disagreement in proper channels that are available to us.\nGod\u2019s will for you and me goes beyond political parties. God\u2019s will is that we honor his representatives in government with obedience and respect. Consider what God said through the apostle Paul: \u201cLet everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves\u201d (Romans 13:1-2). Note what God said through the apostle Peter: \u201cSubmit yourselves for the Lord\u2019s sake to every human authority: whether to the emperor, as the supreme authority, or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right\u2026honor the emperor\u201d (1 Peter 2:13-14, 17).\nThe main person of authority of the Roman Empire when those apostles penned their words was Nero. He was definitely no friend of Christians; his atrocities against them are well documented. Yet, the directives of \u201cbe subject\u201d and \u201chonor\u201d applied even to him\u2014not because his life or actions generated respect, but because he filled a seat of authority God had established.\nIn addition to those passages, consider what God said through the apostle Paul\u2019s first letter to Timothy: \u201cI urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people\u2014for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. This is good, and pleases God our Savior, who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth\u201d (1 Timothy 2:1-4). Whether or not we voted for a candidate, whether or not a government official reflects our faith, we want to pray for them.\nHere is such a prayer from our hymnal: \u201cLord of all nations, I praise you for the blessings you have showered on my country. Guide and guard your representatives in government as they care for the needs of all citizens. Give them wisdom to rule our society with honesty and justice, that we may have peace in our lives and opportunities to witness to your love. Amen.\u201d Let\u2019s offer prayers like that regularly."}
{"prompt": "Help for son", "completion": "Our son is totally messed up since leaving the military four years ago.  The VA has done everything they possibly can to help him.

I have tried to direct him back to his faith, but I am never sure if he is really listening.  How can we help him?\n\n\nI am sorry to hear about your son\u2019s condition. His situation calls for resources that this forum cannot provide. But I can recommend resources for you.\nFirst and foremost would be your pastor and/or your son\u2019s pastor. The local pastor is in a position to provide spiritual care for your son.\nBeyond that, it would be good for you to know about the counseling that is available through Christian Family Solutions, an agency within WELS. They offer face-to-face counseling in select locations and video counseling through an internet connection. This link will give you more information about their services.\nYou and your son might also benefit from the resources of the Lutheran Military Support Group, an organization within WELS and the Evangelical Lutheran Synod. This link will take you to their web site.\nAlso, depending on where your son is jailed, there may be a WELS chaplain nearby who could visit him. Your pastor would have information about that.\nYour son needs God speaking to him through his word. Find out if your son can have access to a Bible. Encourage him to read it. Don\u2019t discount the power of prayer (James 5:16). Keep presenting to God the petitions that concern your son. I will remember him in prayer as well. God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Liturgy:  vain repetition?", "completion": "When the Bible talks about vain repetitions, what does that mean?  Several times I have heard people say that the Lutheran liturgy is nothing but vain repetition.  Thank you. \n\n\n\u201cVain repetitions\u201d is part of the King James Version\u2019s rendering of Matthew 6:7 \u2013 \u201c But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.\u201d Other Bible translations put it this way: \u201cAnd when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words\u201d (NIV).\nThe verb in Matthew 6:7 in Greek has the idea of \u201crepeating the same thing over and over, to babble, to speak without thinking.\u201d And in context, that kind of prayer life takes place with the mistaken idea that people can somehow impress their god to receive their answer to prayer.\nIs there repetition in historic Lutheran liturgies? Certainly there is a template for common items, but there are also numerous places where the worship service offers variety from week to week. Common elements in worship services do not automatically translate into \u201cvain repetitions.\u201d I think you would agree that \u201cspeaking without thinking\u201d can take place in worship services that have no liturgy \u201ctemplate\u201d from week to week.\nThe potential problem is not the form of worship but the worshiper. Consider how God rebuked his Old Testament people for their empty worship life even when they were doing outwardly what he had commanded (Isaiah 1:10-15). God-pleasing worship involves the head and the heart. Your question is a reminder and an encouragement to be involved in that worship regularly."}
{"prompt": "Marriage in biblical days", "completion": "Is engagement seen by God as marriage? If not, why does the Bible say Joseph was going to divorce Mary when she was found to be pregnant, even though they were only engaged at that point? Is it sinful to have sex during engagement?\n\n\nOur marriage customs and laws today are different from those in biblical days. At one point in time, \u201cMary was pledged to be married to Joseph\u201d (Matthew 1:18). Joseph and Mary had given each other their word, in signed papers, that they would become husband and wife. That action legally established the marriage. That explains why Joseph had thoughts of \u201cdivorcing\u201d (Matthew 1:19) Mary when he first learned of her pregnancy.\nWhile Joseph and Mary were legally married by the signing of legal papers, they did not have the right to live together as husband and wife until the time of the public wedding celebration that took place days later.\nYou can see that our manner of \u201cengagement and then marriage\u201d is different from the customs and laws of first century Palestine.\nWhen a man and a woman in our country become engaged, they are not legally married. States regulate marriage, and the laws of the state need to be obeyed. Sexual activity between men and women is reserved for marriage (Hebrews 13:4). Sexual activity outside the marriage bond is sinful."}
{"prompt": "Lord's Supper elements", "completion": "I have a Baptist friend who is in a missionary role in Tamale, northern Ghana. The people there do not have many material possessions, and simple amenities that we take for granted are considered a \"big deal.\" Recently my friend posted a picture of one of the villages in that area celebrating Communion. Instead of wine, they were using Coca-Cola because that is all the people had available to use. Doctrinal differences over the Lord's Supper aside, I was still a bit shocked by this and questioned my friend about it. She repeated to me that the soda was all they had to use, so they \"make do.\"\r\n\r\nThis situation got me thinking about our WELS missions in Africa and other remote areas. Do we run into this situation? How do we handle it? I assume that to remain confessional we make sure that the sacraments are administered correctly, even if that means we need to provide the earthly elements when/if the congregations or peoples are not able to themselves. Can you provide some insight? Thanks!\n\n\nOur mission partners are taught that the \u201cfruit of the vine\u201d is essential for the Lord\u2019s Supper. Coca-Cola would not substitute for it.\nYou ask an interesting question about how our missions in Africa have the needed supplies for their celebration of the sacrament. One way of meeting that need is through the national church \u201cbookstore\u201d in Malawi. It offers Communion wine for those who live in areas where they might not otherwise be able to obtain it. The location is convenient\u2014especially for those who attend pastoral conferences at the central Bible institute. They are then able to take the supplies back with them for use in their Holy Communion services. (We can take much for granted in our stateside congregations, can\u2019t we?)\nWhether in Africa or the United States, the crucified and risen Lord is present in, with and under the bread and wine (the fruit of the vine) in his holy supper to offer and give the forgiveness of sins, life and salvation. What a blessing!"}
{"prompt": "Pets in heaven?", "completion": "This question is an offshoot of another question on this site regarding pets and heaven.  It has always been my understanding that we are not to expect pets to be resurrected in heaven with us, but there appears to be a seemingly widespread belief that this is the case.  I own animals and I love them dearly, and while the Bible speaks of animals as part of God's creation over which humans have stewardship, it seems that pet keeping as it is in the modern world isn't specifically discussed.  Others who support animal resurrection point to passages in the Bible that speak of animals in heaven, but it seems like a big jump to go from \"animals in heaven\" to \"my specific pet will be resurrected.\" Can you shed any light on this matter?\n\n\nI\u2019m afraid the matter will remain in the dark, as I won\u2019t be able to shed any light on it. In the Bible God simply does not address specific questions like this about our life in the new heavens and new earth.\nIf you hear differing beliefs on the question, that is because people are sharing their opinions on a matter on which Scripture is silent. As a dog lover, I too can have my own thoughts about pets\u2014past and present\u2014and eternity, but they remain only my thoughts because Scripture is silent on the matter. I agree that it is a big jump to go from the possibility of having \u201canimals in heaven\u201d to \u201cmy specific pet will be resurrected.\u201d\nI know it is not the answer people want to hear, but we will to have to wait to see all the good things that God has prepared for us in eternity. We cannot begin to imagine what God has in store for us. Unlike our lives on earth, our happiness in heaven will not be dependent in any way on things or possessions. God will be our source of perfect joy and contentment, and there will not be sorrow of any kind in our future (Revelation 21:3-4)."}
{"prompt": "Events in Jesus' life", "completion": "When Jesus died, his soul went directly to heaven. When did he enter hell and for how long? On the third day he rose from the dead, and 40 days later he ascended into heaven. I would like to get the event timeline straight.

Matthew, Mark, Luke, John and the apostle Paul (1 Corinthians 15) record those appearances.\nOver a period of 40 days (Acts 1:3), Jesus appeared to his followers.\nThen, Jesus ascended into heaven, withdrawing his visible presence from people."}
{"prompt": "New hymnal and psalm settings", "completion": "When will the new hymnal be out?  Also, as far as psalm singing is concerned, is there a new version of the accompaniment available?  I winter in the south and attend a WELS church.  It seems they use something different, which I really liked.\n\n\nThe April 4, 2017 WELS \u201cTogether\u201d newsletter includes this update: \u201cThe current hope is that the hymnal and accompanying resources would be available for purchase during the second half of 2021.\u201d\nSince I do not know what you may have experienced in singing the psalms in your southern home church, I can only guess what the accompaniment might have been. I am wondering if it could have been the Wittenberg Psalter. This link will take you to the WELS Resource Center where you can find more information about it. It is also possible that the congregation was field testing new psalm settings. For the best answer, you will want to contact the pastor where you worshiped in winter."}
{"prompt": "Frustration in living the Christian life", "completion": "There are times when I am just truly disgusted with myself when it comes to my sins.  I ask for forgiveness every Sunday in church and pray for strength to do better.  There are many times I knowingly commit sin and I tell myself beforehand I shouldn't do it, but I go ahead and do it anyway.  Examples would be swearing, lying, lust, sexual content.  This scares me so much when I knowingly commit sin.  Am I lost?  Can I still be saved?  Can I be forgiven?  How do I know I am truly repentant?  Thanks.\n\n\nIn Romans 7:17-24 the apostle Paul outlined his personal struggles against sin and his sinful nature. Paul\u2019s words describe the war that takes place between our sinful nature and our new self on a daily basis. Paul\u2019s words illustrate his frustration in falling into sin rather than consistently living according to God\u2019s will. Those kinds of sins are ones that we would call sins of weakness. With those sins, there is no plan to sin, but weak people give in to temptation. They confess their sins, enjoy the forgiveness of sins through faith and resolve to resist temptation in the future, but the cycle can repeat itself.\n\u201cWillful sins\u201d are quite different. Those sins take place when people know what God\u2019s will is, but they don\u2019t care. Instead they act against better knowledge\u2014and conscience\u2014and forge their own way through life. Confession and repentance are lacking. Willful sins are especially serious. You will want to examine your heart and life.\nOnly God and you know your heart. The fact that you are reaching out for help and answers is encouraging to me. Your words sound like the cry of a Christian who \u201cknows the good he ought to do,\u201d but doesn\u2019t do it as regularly and consistently as he would like. Your words lead me to think of the prophet Jeremiah, who lamented: \u201cThe heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can understand it? (Jeremiah 17:9)\nThankfully, in our battle against sin and our sinful nature, there is good news. That comes right after the verses that begin this response: \u201cThanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord!\u201d (Romans 7:25) There is forgiveness of sins through faith in Jesus Christ (1 John 1:9).\nHow can you become more consistent in resisting temptation and living for God? Perhaps you could ask a trusted friend to hold you accountable. Meet with this person regularly to share the ups and downs of the Christian life and to provide opportunity for that person to hold you accountable in living more faithfully for your crucified and risen Lord (2 Corinthians 5:15). (You could do the same for that person.) More than anything, continue to use God\u2019s gospel in word and sacrament to build up your new self and to become stronger in the conviction that you are a redeemed child of God (1 John 3:1-2).\nFurther doubts or questions of your standing with God are best addressed in person, to your pastor. God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Simon Peter and Jonah", "completion": "Is Jonah, from the whale account, Simon Peter's father?\n\n\nI take it that your question is occasioned by Matthew 16:17. \u201cJesus replied, \u2018Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven.\u2019\u201d (The King James Version had rendered Peter\u2019s identity as \u201cSimon Barjona,\u201d \u201cSimon, son of Jonah.\u201d) Jesus spoke those words after Peter confessed that Jesus is the Christ, the promised Savior, the Son of God. In that verse Jesus described Simon as \u201cson of Jonah.\u201d Elsewhere (John 1:42) Simon Peter is called \u201cson of John.\u201d \u201cJohn\u201d and \u201cJonah\u201d reflect the variants, or slight differences, in the Greek text.\nSimon Peter\u2019s father was \u201cJohn\u201d or \u201cJonah.\u201d Let\u2019s say his name was Jonah. He was not the one after whom the Old Testament book is named. Simon Peter\u2019s father and that Jonah only shared a common name. They were separated in time by about nine centuries.\nLastly, \u201cwhale\u201d is not part of the Bible\u2019s vocabulary regarding the Jonah of the Old Testament; \u201chuge fish\u201d is.

{"prompt": "God's communication to people", "completion": "What is the WELS position on visions, dreams, and other such personal experiences with God? A WELS pastor seemed to change the subject rather quickly, pointing back to the Word of God, when a friend of mine told him about his vision of God that he experienced.  \n\n\nGod of course can do anything. He can communicate to us any way he wants. The Bible describes instances when God did speak directly to people, through others and in dreams. The fact that God communicated in these ways in the past does not guarantee that God will do so in the future. We have no promise of God communicating to us beyond Scripture.\nWhat the Bible does say is that \u201cIn the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son\u2026\u201d (Hebrews 1:1-2). We have God\u2019s full communication to us in the pages of the Old and New Testament. There is no need to look elsewhere for communication from God.\nIn addition, God tells us that dreams can actually be a tool of people who want to mislead and deceive us (Jeremiah 23:25-28).\nIf there is a \u201cvoice\u201d from God inside us, it is the natural knowledge of his law and a conscience that is guided properly by Holy Scripture. If there is a \u201cvoice\u201d from God inside us, it is the new self\u2014that part of us that is \u201ccreated to be like God in true righteousness and holiness\u201d (Ephesians 4:24)\u2014that desires to live life according to God\u2019s will.\nThe pastor referenced in your question did well to focus on God\u2019s communication to us through the Bible."}
{"prompt": "Moral decline in world", "completion": "It is a commonly held belief among elderly people that our world is in moral decline. It seems that I could either support or oppose this belief using logic and evidence (support: look at what disgusting things appear on social media compared to 10 years ago; oppose: people have always been sinful since sin first began), but what does Scripture reveal to us about the belief that the world, as a whole, is going into a gradual moral decline?\n\n\nThe apostle Paul provided a sobering picture of life in \u201cthe last days,\u201d which the book of Hebrews calls the New Testament time period (Hebrews 1:2). \u201cBut mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days. People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God\u201d (2 Timothy 3:1-4)\nWhile that is a general picture of life in the New Testament age, Jesus asked this haunting question after he narrated and explained one of his parables: \u201cWhen the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?\u201d (Luke 18:8) Rather than leading us to expect a golden age of Christianity as we head toward Judgment Day, the Bible prepares us for conditions that go from bad to worse.\nStill, we do not fear. \u201cOur Lord God Almighty reigns\u201d (Revelation 19:6). The world is not spinning out of control. God remains our refuge and strength, even and especially when life is crumbling and unraveling (Psalm 46).\nSo what can you and I do in times like these?

{"prompt": "Abuse of alcohol", "completion": "Is it a sin to get drunk or to simply be a drunkard?\n\n\nAbusing alcohol is a sin (Proverbs 23:20, 31-33; Ephesians 5:18).\nIf a \u201cdrunkard\u201d means someone whose lifestyle involves abusing alcohol, that too is sinful. \u201cDrunkards\u201d (1 Corinthians 6:10) are included in the list of sinners who will be excluded from the kingdom of God\u2014not because of the nature of their sin but because of their impenitence.\nBy not having any context to your question, I do not know if the subject of alcoholism enters the picture. Alcoholism can provide an understanding of the abuse of alcohol, but it does not remove the person\u2019s accountability for that abuse."}
{"prompt": "Addressing a friend's wrong ideas", "completion": "My friend has told me that the Bible has some mistranslations that make a day seem like an age.  He also claims that this mistranslation has made it so that the flood does not mean the whole world but just a specific piece of land.  He also claims that people of other races are not direct descendants of God's people and are inferior to white people.  So, I am wondering, how do I combat this mistranslation error and that all people are God's people and that there were not people before Adam and Eve? Please let me know if you have any insight on how to combat this.  \n\n\nThe burden of proof is on your friend. Ask him to demonstrate the supposed errors in Bible translations. Scripture is clear when it speaks of time periods, the worldwide flood of Noah\u2019s day and the human race.\nHave your friend consider Acts 17:24-27 and see the world\u2019s \u201cfamily tree.\u201d Have your friend re-consider his prejudicial views toward other people in light of Acts 10:34-35; Galatians 3:26-29; Philippians 2:3-4; and, Revelation 7:9-10.\nYou and I cannot change anyone\u2019s mind. God can change minds. So, encourage your friend to read Scripture for himself. As he does, pray that the Holy Spirit would lead him to understand and embrace the truth in faith.\nWhat you will want to do is grow in your knowledge and understanding of the Bible so you can address your friend\u2019s wrong ideas. Our goal is not to engage in theological arguments. Our goal is simply to testify to the truth of God\u2019s word. After that, the results are out of our hands and beyond our control."}
{"prompt": "Private use of the Lord's Supper", "completion": "I am a WELS member and only ask this question for the edification of others, and myself too.  Nowhere in the Bible does it tell us that the Lord's Supper must be administered by a pastor.  Am I correct to say that if the need arises, it is possible for the head of the household to administer the Lord's Supper?  We as fathers are responsible for the teaching and preparing of our children and families; if necessary, we can also baptize and administer the Lord's Supper too.  Please correct me if I'm wrong, but include Scripture as our brother Luther would insist upon. Thank you and blessings!\n\n\nGod has given the keys to all believers (Matthew 18:18-20; John 20:21-23; 1 Peter 2:9). God\u2019s will is that believers gather together for worship (Hebrews 10:24-25). At worship services the pastor exercises the keys, including the administration of the Lord\u2019s Supper (Ephesians 4:11; 2 Timothy 4:2; 1 Peter 5:2). The picture we have from Scripture is that the Lord\u2019s Supper is a holy meal for the congregation of believers (1 Corinthians 11:18, 20, 33).\nWhile Scripture does not explicitly prohibit exceptional celebrations of the sacrament such as described in your question, there are things to think about. I do not know what \u201cneed\u201d is referenced in your question, but if there is not an opportunity to receive the Lord\u2019s Supper at some point in life, we want to recognize that God offers and gives the same blessings through the gospel in word form as he does through the gospel in sacrament form (Romans 1:16). Additionally, while we enjoy Christian freedom in so many areas of life, God wants us always to be concerned about fellow Christians (Philippians 2:4)\u2014not doing things that might confuse them in the faith but rather edifying them and building them up (Romans 14; 1 Corinthians 8; 1 Thessalonians 5:11). We want to be doing all things \u201cin a fitting and orderly way\u201d (1 Corinthians 14:40).\nYour question would be a good one to bring up to your pastor, who has God-given responsibility for your spiritual care (1 Peter 5:2)."}
{"prompt": "Associating with others", "completion": "How does a confessional Christian relate to a fellow Christian of that same church who was going to be excommunicated because of one's impenitence, but then asked to be released from the congregation instead, which the church did with a letter of admonition? This person shortly thereafter claimed to have left the Christian religion. In regard to Matthew 18, 2 Thess. 3, and 1Cor. 5, does a Christian continue not to associate with the impenitent brother who has left the Christian faith, or, now that the person has claimed not to be a Christian, does the Christian now associate with them and resume a relationship? \n\n\nIn regard to either scenario, the concern about \u201cassociating\u201d is that, by our attitudes and actions, we somehow mistakenly lead an impenitent person to downplay impenitence and unbelief, and conclude that what they did was not so bad after all.\nIf we completely cut off contact from such people, we also remove godly influence and Christian testimony from their lives. (And it is only through the word of God through which God works to change hearts and lives.) Christians like you, then, strive to maintain a balance between testifying to the seriousness of sin, impenitence and unbelief, and living a life of Christian love in your interaction with others. God bless your balancing of these testimonies!"}
{"prompt": "Jesus' actions on the cross", "completion": "A question came up in a Bible class at our WELS church about whether or not Jesus accepted the wine vinegar offered to him on the cross.  The consensus was (and acknowledged by the pastor) that Jesus did not accept it or \"spit it out.\"  However, John 19:30 tells us, \"When he had received the drink, Jesus said, 'It is finished.'\"  I would be inclined to believe that, after suffering on the cross for six hours, his mouth was so dry that he could not have spoken his last words without first receiving the drink. Is that correct?\n\n\nWe get the complete picture of Jesus\u2019 suffering, death and resurrection by looking at the parallel accounts of other evangelists.\nMark 15:23 speaks of the soldiers offering Jesus wine, mixed with myrrh. They made that offer when they were preparing to crucify the Lord. Previously, I offered this commentary: \u201cMyrrh had the properties of dulling the senses and making a crucifixion victim more cooperative and less likely to put up any resistance as he was being fastened to a cross. When Jesus tasted the potion offered by the soldiers, he rejected it. He refused to reach the culmination of his messianic mission in a stupor; he was going to drink the cup of suffering for the world\u2019s sins fully alert and in command of his senses. That meant he would refuse to drink what was in the soldiers\u2019 cup.\u201d (When Christ Walked Among Us)\nAt some point later, Jesus spoke the words recorded in John 19:30. He expressed his thirst\u2014fulfilling prophecy (Psalm 22:15)\u2014and then received wine vinegar, without myrrh, to be able to speak loudly and clearly the message the world needed to hear: \u201cIt is finished.\u201d We praise him for that message!"}
{"prompt": "Lutheran Social Services", "completion": "Does the WLS contribute to Lutheran Social Services?\n\n\nIf, by \u201cWLS,\u201d you meant Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary, the answer is \u201cno.\u201d If you intended \u201cWELS,\u201d the answer is also \u201cno.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Living together before marriage", "completion": "When a couple is living together and wants to be married in a WELS church, what should a pastor do?\r\n\r\n\n\n\nA pastor will be interested in meeting with the individuals to apply God\u2019s word to their situation. He will be interested in encouraging repentant attitudes toward sin, delivering the gospel message to penitent sinners and working with them to \u201cproduce fruit in keeping with repentance\u201d (Matthew 3:8). A pastor will be interested in having the couple recognize the offense their situation can cause others and address how to remove that offense (1 Corinthians 10:32). A pastor is interested in having a man and a woman follow God\u2019s word and the laws of the state before they begin living as husband and wife.\nWhen two people of the opposite sex live together without the benefit of marriage, they put themselves into tempting situations where they can break the sixth commandment. The Bible tells Christians to \u201cflee from sexual immorality\u201d (1 Corinthians 6:18). God explains that he \u201cwill judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral\u201d (Hebrews 13:4). If a man and a woman living together without being married claim to be refraining from sexual activity, they are still in a position of causing offense to others (Matthew 18:6-7) and emboldening them to sin. In addition, their lives are not in line with what God says: that \u201camong you, there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality\u201d (Ephesians 5:3).\nThe proliferation of couples living together before marriage definitely presents pastors with ongoing challenges in addressing sin and interacting with the family and friends of those involved. So, pray for pastors. Theirs is a weighty responsibility to warn people about sin (Ezekiel 33:7-9) and to watch over their souls (Acts 20:28)."}
{"prompt": "How to recognize others' musical talents", "completion": "We are starting a praise band in our church.  Does the synod have any guidelines to the question of paying the members or expecting them to use their talents to provide a service to the worship service? Thanks.  We are working on our ministry plan for 2017-2018.\n\n\nTo my knowledge, there are no such guidelines. It is a congregational matter whether service of any kind by members is compensated or is voluntary. You would probably do best to speak to the leaders of congregations who oversee such musical ministries."}
{"prompt": "Position on Scouting", "completion": "For many years WELS has had concerns with Scouting, especially with the former handbook promoting work righteousness, and rightly so.  When did that change? Spare the details, but at a congregation meeting the church president talked about picking up his son from Boy Scouts.  After talking to the pastor privately, he said the handbook we were always concerned with has since been replaced and Scouting has become a totally secular organization. Aren't there still other concerns?  Is WELS now officially OK with Scouting? \n\n\nOur web site contains the following response to a previous question about our synod\u2019s position on Scouting. Because Scouting has not changed its oath or law, our position remains the same.\n\u201cThe Boy Scouts are among the most respected organizations in this country, and the skills, activities, and companionship which they offer could be a benefit to any child. Yet for more than 70 years the Wisconsin Synod has warned its members that their children should not participate in the Scouting program.\n\u201cOur basic objection to Scouting was that the required promise and law contain religious elements which imply that the Scout can do his duty to God regardless of what religion he belongs to. This contradicts the clear statements of Scripture that no one can perform works pleasing to God without faith in Christ.\n\u201cOver the years the wording of the Scout Law and its explanation have become vaguer and less offensive, but the religious principles have been maintained. All members of the Scouts must accept the Scout Oath and Law, but they may interpret them in their own way. For example, an atheist boy who refused to promise to do his duty to God was denied membership, but when he took the oath with the understanding that \u2018god\u2019 was not a personal being, he was permitted to join. This is certainly a very offensive interpretation of the concept of \u2018duty to God.\u2019\n\u201cRecognition of the religious basis of Scouting is not limited to the WELS. Advocates of strong separation of church and state have objected to the promotion of Scouting in public schools because of its religious requirements.\n\u201cBecause the religious requirements of Scouting remain unchanged, our WELS congregations cannot make use of the Scouting organizations. We have a better option in the Lutheran Pioneers, which provide many of the same benefits as Scouting, without the objectionable religious requirements.\n\u201cThe religious principles of Scouting remain unchanged, but there has been one notable development. The increased vagueness of the Scouting literature and the fact that some Scout troops may make little use of the religious features make it more difficult for pastors and teachers to convincingly demonstrate from the Scout Handbook the false religious principles which underlie Scouting. This makes it more difficult to convince parents that their children should not belong to the Scouts. The Girl Scouts are a separate organization, but the same principles and observations apply to that group also.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "How to determine offerings", "completion": "Hello. I was just confirmed last Sunday and was wondering where I should start with my offerings. How should I figure out what to give?\n\n\nWhat a great question! Congratulations, first of all, on becoming a communicant member of your congregation. That membership status provides you with privileges and responsibilities. It is very encouraging to read of your desire to be a faithful manager of God\u2019s possessions.\nThe June 2017 \u201cLight for our path\u201d column in Forward in Christ will address a question like yours, but let me give you a little preview.\nThis whole subject matter begins with the recognition that God is the owner of all things (Psalm 24:1; Haggai 2:8). God entrusts his possessions to people, who are to manage them faithfully.\nOld Testament ceremonial laws gave God\u2019s people specific instructions on what to give back to him. There were laws dealing with tithes (10% of income). New Testament followers of the Lord like us are free from those ceremonial laws (Colossians 2:16-17). While we welcome Christian freedom, we also welcome some guidance\u2014as evidenced by your question.\nGod provides guidance. The application of the words in 1 Corinthians 16:2 is that we plan our offerings and we do so with a proportionate view toward our income. And so I would encourage you to give back to God first (the \u201cfirstfruits\u201d principle in the Old Testament) and to plan your offerings based on a percentage of whatever income you might have.\nWhat percentage? That\u2019s where your Christian freedom enters the picture. For discussion\u2019s sake, let\u2019s say you earn money from babysitting or a newspaper delivery route. What would 5% of that money be? That could be your offering. What would 7% be? 10%? You get the idea. Nobody can tell another Christian what to give back to God. Essentially, the guidance from Scripture for our offerings is giving ___% of our income. You have freedom in filling in the blank. Recognizing how blessed we are through Christ provides every reason for filling in that blank with higher, rather than lower, numbers (Romans 12:1).\nAgain, congratulations on your Confirmation. I would say you are starting out well with the responsibilities and privileges that your communicant membership has given you. The apostle Paul\u2019s sentiment toward the Christians in Philippi is mine for you\u2014that God \u201cwho began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus\u201d (Philippians 1:6)."}
{"prompt": "Questions about 1 Timothy", "completion": "In 1st Timothy, Paul explains the roles of men and woman. Men are head of the church and of their families.  The man is supposed to guide and lead,  but what about single females who live far away from their fathers? Who is supposed to guide and care for them? Also, Paul continues and states that woman are saved through childbirth. I know that only through Christ is one saved through faith in him. What does Paul mean by that? Not all woman can have children.  What does that mean for them?\n\n\nThe principle of loving head and loving helper (1 Corinthians 11:3ff) has application in different ways to different people. In your current home situation, you have the responsibility of providing for your material needs and seeing to it that your spiritual needs are met. The fourth commandment is always in place, but the scope of application changes as parents and children grow older.\nWhen it comes to women being saved \u201cthrough childbearing\u201d (1 Timothy 2:15), you are correct in stating that salvation comes about only through faith in Jesus Christ (Ephesians 2:8-9). Giving birth to children is not another means to salvation. So what does that expression mean? Let me pass along these thoughts from the People\u2019s Bible Series for 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy and Titus: \u201cPaul has been speaking about the woman\u2019s specific role as given in creation. She had stepped out of that role, had been deceived by Satan and become a sinner. She need not, however, feel deprived or inferior as man\u2019s helper. Salvation is hers, living in the role God had assigned to her. Unique and special in that role is bearing children and the mothering that goes with it. Living according to her God-given role will not in any way deprive her of the salvation that we all have alone through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. A Christian woman will find genuine fulfillment as she conducts herself according to God\u2019s plan.\u201d (pages 44-45) That clear explanation illustrates why the People\u2019s Bible Series is such a popular resource for Christians.\nSo, continue living your life in the joy and confidence that, through faith in Jesus, you are a child of God (Galatians 3:26-29)!"}
{"prompt": "Civil disobedience", "completion": "Hello, \r\n\r\nI am interested in your thoughts regarding Rosa Parks. Do you believe she should have given up her seat? Also, what are your thoughts regarding civil disobedience in general?  God's blessings.  \n\n\nAs I refrain from offering personal opinions and speculation in these responses, I will direct my remarks to the general subject matter that is referenced in your second question.\nIn the Bible God tells us to submit to his representatives in government (Romans 13). We are to give them honor and respect and obedience. There can be exceptional behavior on our part if we face conflicting directives from God and the government. In cases like that, we obey God (Acts 5:29).\nThat passage from Acts guides our actions if the government compels us to go against God\u2019s word, but what if the government enacts laws that are unjust but do not force sinful actions on our part? There are peaceful options available to us. First of all, we pray. We pray that God would bless his representatives in government with wisdom and love, to rule with justice and impartiality (1 Timothy 2:1-4). If we disagree with legislation, we are able to contact our legislators and relay our disagreement to those people who represent us.\nIs there a place for civil disobedience? An answer you will hear in our circles is that, within limits and reason, there might be occasion for passive civil disobedience. That disobedience does not consist of violent resistance but peaceful inaction. The motive for that course of (in)action would be important. A noble motive could be one that seeks to protect other people from suffering injustice.\nWhile Scripture is our guide in matters like this, we can benefit from God\u2019s people who explain and apply Scripture, and so you might be interested in reading Martin Luther\u2019s thoughts on civil disobedience in his work: \u201cCan Soldiers Too Be Saved?\u201d\nLiving as members of God\u2019s kingdom and citizens of an earthly kingdom definitely presents challenges to us. While we have our eyes on God\u2019s fourth commandment, honoring his representatives in all areas of life, we have our sights even higher\u2014on God\u2019s first commandment, loving him more than anyone or anything else. And as Christians, our greatest motive for doing that is to thank him for his forgiving love in Christ."}
{"prompt": "Holding church leaders accountable", "completion": "Can a lay person hold the pastor and leaders of a church accountable for overlooking open sin in the congregation?   \n\n\nCertainly. Following the example of the Christians in Berea (Acts 17:11), Christians have the responsibility of examining the teaching they receive from their spiritual leaders with the message of the Bible. As God instructs the leaders of his church to watch their life and doctrine closely (1 Timothy 4:16), it follows that Christians will speak to those leaders when there are problems with their life and doctrine. When Christians think of having those conversations, they will follow the direction of Matthew 18:15-20. Seeking to restore the wandering is vitally important (James 5:19).\nFinally, your question about accountability serves as a reminder that God himself holds pastors accountable for their work (Ezekiel chapters 3 and 34)."}
{"prompt": "Lives of spiritual leaders", "completion": "Should a Freemason and a Boy Scout leader be spiritual leaders (elders) of a church? \n\n\nThe answer is \u201cno.\u201d If you have knowledge of this, you want your course of action to be guided by Matthew 18:15-20."}
{"prompt": "Cliques in congregations", "completion": "Is a \"clique\" within a congregation a problem? If we are all brothers and sisters in Christ, doesn't this destroy the fellowship we should share in a congregation? Should this person be confronted?\n\n\nCliques within congregations do war against the unity of the family of believers. Chapters 1 and 3 of 1 Corinthians address the divisions that existed among the believers in the congregation in Corinth. That part of Scripture would be good reading material in the context of your question.\nIf an individual is sinning by destroying the unity of a congregation, by all means speak to that person in the spirit of Matthew 18:15-20.\nEphesians 4:3 provides good encouragement for all Christians: \u201cMake every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "The prostitute in Revelation 17", "completion": "Who is the prostitute that resides on seven hills?  I know that the office of the pope is considered an Antichrist, but Rome is situated on seven hills.  Could a pope be the prostitute?\n\n\nIn places like Ezekiel 16 and 20, and Hosea 4 and 5, Scripture uses the imagery of sexual impurity and marital infidelity (prostitution) to illustrate unfaithfulness to God and his word. The prostitute sitting on seven hills (Revelation 17) is another one of those pictures. The seven hills of Rome point to the main Antichrist (2 Thessalonians 2).\nElsewhere on this web site, you can find our doctrinal statement on the Antichrist that explains why the Lutheran Confessions identified the papacy as the Antichrist."}
{"prompt": "Application of 1 Corinthians 14:34-35", "completion": "I understand about the husband being the head of the home and submitting to his leadership. However, there is another Scripture passage, 1 Corinthians 14:34-35, that concerns me. I would like to know how far the idea expressed is to be implemented.  \r\n \r\n\n\n\nIn This We Believe, a statement of belief of our church body, you can find this explanation and application of those verses: \u201cWe believe that women may participate in offices and activities of the public ministry except where that work involves authority over men (1 Timothy 2:11,12). This means that women may not serve as pastors nor participate in assemblies of the church in ways that exercise authority over men (1 Corinthians 11:3; 14:33-35).\u201d\nYou can read that information in its context via this link."}
{"prompt": "Summarizing our faith", "completion": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm still a fairly new WELS member. I was wondering how to concisely explain what it means to be a WELS Lutheran to someone asking what the denomination is. I understand what we believe but I find it hard to quickly sum up. \r\n\r\nThank you. \n\n\nA concise explanation is going to vary from one person to another, and the information I want to pass along to you would probably not fit the definition of being concise. In addition, the explanation of what it means to be a WELS Lutheran would undoubtedly be more meaningful to people if you came up with that explanation yourself.\nWith those thoughts in mind, let me pass along a couple of resources that summarize what we believe. The first resource is a section of this web site titled \u201cWhat the Bible and Lutherans teach.\u201d This link will take you to that section. While there are almost 30 different subjects that are treated, you could condense the list of subjects to come up with a more concise explanation of our faith.\nA second resource is a book titled \u201cPositively Lutheran: a simple statement of what Lutherans believe.\u201d It is available from Northwestern Publishing House via this link. That resource would also give you content with which to formulate a concise explanation of our faith.\nWhat you will probably discover is that the explanation of your faith may not be as concise as you would like. Why is that? Christian faith encompasses so many subjects that are in the Bible. But if you want to get really concise, you could point to the three solas (\u201calone\u201d) of the Lutheran Reformation: by grace alone, by faith alone, by Scripture alone. God\u2019s grace, his undeserved love for sinners, is the reason for providing salvation. We enjoy salvation only through faith in Jesus Christ and not because of anything we do or don\u2019t do. Scripture alone is the source of our faith.\nI hope this information will be helpful to you. Welcome to our family of believers!"}
{"prompt": "Sin and stewardship", "completion": "I have two questions.  Do you think when God created Adam and Eve, He knew and wanted them to commit the first sin, so that we would need to look for him as guidance because we are imperfect?  Also, I was a visitor at a WELS congregation and participated in their Bible Study. Their theme for it was stewardship. Many of the discussion points that were brought up by others around me was that we need to continue to donate money (whether a lot or a little) to be good stewards of Christ. I personally felt that we could do other things (like donate our time to a food pantry or Habitat for Humanity) to be good stewards of Christ. Is it wrong to think like this, or does the only way to be a good steward simply involve money?\n\n\nBeing all-knowing (1 John 3:20), God certainly knew that Adam and Eve were going to fall into sin. Beyond that, God formulated his plan of salvation in eternity (Revelation 13:8). Still, we need to keep separate God\u2019s foreknowledge and his will. The Bible makes it clear that God is not responsible for people\u2019s sin (James 1:13-15). People are responsible for their own sins.\nWhen it comes to Christian stewardship, the starting point is that God is the owner of everything (Psalm 24:1). We are stewards and managers of everything that God has entrusted to us: life, time, abilities, and money. We strive to manage all those gifts of God faithfully.\nWhen we think of volunteering our time in our communities, we will want to steer clear of agencies that identify themselves as ecumenical Christian organizations. That is the case with the organization you mentioned. By their organizational structure and worksite practices, they pretend there is Christian unity when there is not, and they blur doctrinal differences among Christians.\u00a0 Communities offer many other opportunities for service and involvement without compromising our faith.\u00a0 Your second question is a reminder and encouragement for us to be \u201csalt\u201d and \u201clight\u201d in our lives (Matthew 5:13-16)."}
{"prompt": "\"Ex opere operato\"", "completion": "I am reading through the Lutheran Confessions (Book of Concord) and have come across the Latin term \"ex opere operato.\"  I looked it up and it apparently means \"from the work worked\" which doesn't make sense to me when I read it in context in the Confessions.  Can you tell me what English phrase I can translate this to that is more meaningful?\n\n\n\u201cBy the performance of the action\u201d may get the idea across clearer. That phrase conveys the Roman Catholic teaching that the sacraments bring blessings to people simply because they are performed. (Think of masses being performed for the dead.)\nWith scriptural support, the Book of Concord condemns that teaching and emphasizes that faith is necessary to enjoy the administration of a sacrament.\nGod bless your reading of the Lutheran Confessions!"}

{"prompt": "Concern for job position", "completion": "I am a member of a WELS congregation.  I am considering going to work as a school secretary at a Missouri Synod school.  Is there a potential conflict here?  It sounds like they would not have a concern, but would it be a problem from the stance of the WELS church?  I feel like I'm being paid to do a job but by working there and getting a paycheck, am I endorsing their actions and beliefs?\n\n\nIf the job description for your position is standard, there would not be religious fellowship issues involved. Our churches and schools sometimes employ non-members in similar positions.\nLike so many areas of life, conscience is something to be considered. If you were to think that working in that position is wrong, then it would be wrong for you (Romans 14:14). Scripture directs us to act in faith not doubt (Romans 14:23). It sounds like this is not a problem for you. God\u2019s blessings to you!"}
{"prompt": "Attend same sex wedding ceremony?", "completion": "Our niece is getting married in a gay marriage ceremony very soon.  Should we attend the ceremony and reception but continue to let her know that we and the Bible do not agree with her lifestyle?  We are torn about attending because we continue to witness and let her know that these are sinful acts that are not being repented, however, we want to continue to show our love for her and continue to witness to her without her shutting us out of her life and not allowing us to witness to her.\n\n\nRomans 14:14, 23 teaches us not to act contrary to our conscience. If you are convinced that it would be wrong for you even to attend the ceremony, then it would be wrong for you. On the other hand, you might be convinced that you can, in good conscience, attend the ceremony.\nYour attendance or absence from the ceremony is not the most important matter here. More important is what you communicate to your niece about your presence or absence. If you choose to attend, you can explain that you came because you love her, not because you agree with the actions she has taken. If you choose not to attend, you can explain that you wrestled with how to show love to her and also how to stand up for the truths of Scripture, and you settled on not attending.\nI agree with you that your niece needs your Christian witness in her life. She needs loving Christians pointing her to God\u2019s law and gospel. She needs the truths of God\u2019s word in her life, so that the Holy Spirit can bring about godly attitudes and actions.\nAs you can see from this response, the decision to accept or decline the invitation to attend the ceremony is entirely yours. Most important is what you communicate to your niece regarding your decision. Speak the truth in love to her (Ephesians 4:15), and remind her that she will continue to be in your prayers. God bless you."}

Since the divorce and becoming a single parent happened before he became a Christian, is he eligible for the ministry? Most denominations would frown on this, but what is the WELS stance on this?  \n\n\nThe matter of divorce in and of itself would not be a barrier to serving in the pubic ministry.

{"prompt": "Habitat for Humanity", "completion": "Is Habitat for Humanity a religious organization that we should avoid because donating to them would involve principles of fellowship?\n\n\nYour question is one that was asked and answered in Forward in Christ eleven years ago (February 2006). Here are excerpts from that column:\n\u201cHabitat for Humanity was founded in 1976 by former Alabama businessman Millard Fuller and his wife, Linda. Habitat calls itself a non-profit, ecumenical, Christian housing ministry. Fuller has also developed the theology of the hammer, which he explains in a book by the same name.\n\u201cSince it is the desire of Habitat to partner with churches, including WELS churches, to build and renovate homes, it is important to evaluate Habitat\u2019s ministry before entering a partnership. There is no doubt that a concern for the poor can be a response to God\u2019s love for us in Christ. The apostle John wrote, \u2018If anyone has material possessions and sees his brother in need but has no pity on him, how can the love of God be in him? Dear children, let us not love with words or tongue but with actions and in truth\u2019 (1 John 3:17,18).\n\u201cHowever, confessional Lutherans will have legitimate concerns about the theology and ministry of Habitat for Humanity. The first concern is that Habitat\u2019s ministry is a social gospel ministry. Its highest priority is to improve people\u2019s circumstances on this earth. Fuller credits Walter Rauschenbusch, who has been called \u2018the father of the social gospel movement in America,\u2019 with shaping his thinking. In his book, Fuller includes the following quotation from Rauschenbusch: \u2018The non-ethical practices and beliefs in Christianity nearly all center on the winning of heaven and immortality. On the other hand, the kingdom of God can be established by nothing except righteous life and action.\u2019 This concept of the kingdom of God conflicts with our confession that \u2018God\u2019s kingdom comes when our heavenly Father gives us his Holy Spirit, so that by his grace we believe his holy Word.\u2019 (The Second Petition, Luther\u2019s Small Catechism). It also raises questions about the nature of the church\u2019s mission. Jesus said that his mission was \u2018to seek and to save what was lost\u2019 (Luke 19:10). He gave us our mission when he commanded, \u2018Therefore go and make disciples of all nations . . . \u2018 (Matthew 28:19,20).\n\u201cAnother concern is Habitat\u2019s desire to be an ecumenical organization, that is, an organization with \u2018a concern to reunite the divided Christian family\u2019 (p. 80). But this reuniting is not done on the basis of a careful study of the Scriptures. In his book, Fuller approvingly quotes the slogan, \u2018Doctrine divides, service unites\u2019 (p. 80). He says unity comes about when people of diverse religious beliefs work together to build homes for the poor. \u2018Maybe, just maybe, God wants to use \u2018the theology of the hammer\u2019 as a means to draw his divergent family closer together\u2019 (p. 79). This statement and others like it come close to making the building of homes for the poor a means of grace. Since devotions, prayers, and dedication services are common at Habitat sites, there is also the potential for involvement in expressions of church fellowship that are not based on agreement about what the Bible teaches.\n\u201cTo register these concerns about Habitat for Humanity is not to say that we are free from caring for the poor. Jesus said, \u2018I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me\u2019 (Matthew 25:40). However, we want to help the poor in a way that enables us to remain clear about the church\u2019s mission and about the importance of sound doctrine.\u201d\nFinancial gifts to our Synod\u2019s Christian Aid and Relief can provide humanitarian aid to people without the concerns that were listed in the column above."}
{"prompt": "Reaction to the Law of Attraction", "completion": "Law of attraction - Have there been any conference papers or good reference books written to counter the very popular mindset of the law of attraction?  Books such as \"Think and Grow Rich\" by Napoleon Hill promote things such as: \"You are the master of your destiny.\"  A friend of mine believes what he has written in his two books is based on biblical principles, but far from it. In the account of Job, he writes that Job willed it to himself that all might be restored to him... In short the law of attraction turns our attention from our God and puts it on self.  \n\n\nI did not find resources from individuals from within our fellowship.\nI did come across a video interview in which the individual offers a good critique of the subject matter you referenced. You can access the interview via this link.\nYou have the right idea about the law of attraction and its various forms: it definitely turns our attention away from God and puts people at the forefront of life. What we want to do is direct people to the message of the Bible\u2014that God is the giver of all good things (James 1:17)."}
{"prompt": "Faith and good works", "completion": "You defend Luther's translation of Romans 3:28 by stating that this is the true teaching of the Scriptures.  Why, then, does St. Paul say that faith without love is nothing (1 Cor 13:2)?  Why does St. James teach that faith alone without works is dead (Jas 2:17)?  Why does Christ say that only to those who keep His commandments (i.e. works) will He manifest Himself (Jn 14:21)?  Do not the religious fanatics manifest great faith, but have no love within their hearts?  If justification by faith alone is true, the 9/11 hijackers and the members of the Inquisition must have been justified in the sight of God by their faith alone, despite their iniquitous works.  Rather, we are justified by faith, hope and love, which is operative in works (1 Cor 13:13; Gal 5:6).\n\n\nScripture is very clear that we are justified, declared \u201cnot guilty,\u201d through faith and not by what we do (Romans 3:21-28; Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:5). Saving faith will show itself in a life of good works (Matthew 25:34-40). Faith alone saves, but saving faith is never alone. Saving faith demonstrates itself in a life of love for God and others.\nYour reference to the hijackers does not follow, as there is salvation only through faith in Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12). Faith in a false god does not save.\nIf you would like to read a recent article on Luther\u2019s translation of Romans 3:28, this link will take you to it.\nThe good works that we do form a big \u201cThank you\u201d to God for so graciously and freely giving us salvation through Jesus Christ his Son."}
{"prompt": "Judgment for Old Testament people", "completion": "When people died before Jesus, where did they go? \n\n\nTheir souls went to heaven or hell. When a person\u2019s life on earth comes to an end, the body and soul separate (Ecclesiastes 12:7) and judgment takes place (Hebrews 9:27). That has always been the case, without regard to the time of Jesus\u2019 earthly life and ministry.\nRecall that there were people in hell when Jesus descended into hell to proclaim his victory over sin, death and hell (1 Peter 3:18-20). Additionally, think of Elijah\u2019s glorious entrance to heaven when his life on earth came to an end (2 Kings 2). Finally, Hebrews 11 describes the Old Testament \u201cheroes of faith\u201d as enjoying their heavenly home."}
{"prompt": "Decision theology", "completion": "My sister says she made a decision for Christ. Where does this idea come from and are there some verses that I can share with her that show that God has chosen us?\n\n\nDecision theology results from a rejection of infant baptism and original sin.\nThe Bible makes it very clear that we cannot bring ourselves to faith in Jesus Christ. For starters, we were spiritually dead people by nature (Ephesians 2:1), having no ability to do anything like deciding to believe in Jesus. Secondly, we were natural enemies of God because of sin and unbelief (Romans 8:7). We would not have wanted to bring ourselves to faith in God even if we had the ability. Finally, the Bible tells us that we were spiritually blind by nature (2 Corinthians 4:4), unable to see the truth about ourselves or God.\nScripture teaches plainly that Christian faith \u201cis not from yourselves, it is the gift of God\u201d (Ephesians 2:8). Jesus\u2019 words to his first disciples apply to us as well: \u201cYou did not choose me, but I chose you\u201d (John 15:16). The Holy Spirit is the one who enables us to confess Jesus Christ as our Savior (1 Corinthians 12:3).\nSalvation is a gift from God. The faith that makes salvation our own is also a gift from God. God gets all the credit\u2014and praise\u2014for our salvation which we enjoy through faith in Jesus Christ."}

{"prompt": "Sinful nature and cross bearing", "completion": "Is a Christian's constant battle against the sinful nature a form of cross bearing and suffering?\n\n\nThat battle can be a form of bearing the cross, and that battle certainly involves suffering, doesn\u2019t it?\nDuring his ministry Jesus spoke on three separate occasions (Matthew 10:38; 16:24; Luke 14:27) of the need for his followers to take up their cross and follow him. We usually understand cross bearing to mean the sufferings and persecution that result from our connection to Jesus Christ in faith. In that regard, our sinful nature certainly rebels against our new self and our connection to Jesus. It does try to stir up all kinds of trouble in our life. Part of our battle in living the Christian life is that we deny ourselves and put down the desires of our sinful nature. This is where people can see the connection between battling against the sinful nature and bearing the cross. Then, again, unbelievers have a sinful nature, and we would not describe any attempt on their part to resist the sinful nature, for whatever reason, as cross bearing.\nAdditionally, if cross bearing is a holy imitation of Jesus\u2019 life, suffering as he suffered (1 Peter 2:21), there is a big difference between Jesus and us: he had no sinful nature.\nWhile there can be questions regarding the relationship between battling the sinful nature and bearing the cross, there is no question that we need to confront our sinful nature daily through contrition and repentance. The struggle between the old self and the new self is real (Romans 7:15-25). It is constant, as you noted, but \u201cThanks be to God\u201d (Romans 7:25) for forgiving all our sins, for giving us the spiritual weaponry to fight against temptation and for assuring us of our ultimate and complete victory over sin, death and hell."}
{"prompt": "WELS and LCMS", "completion": "I have been reading your site for this past week looking for why WELS and LCMS are different and cannot be in fellowship together. We believe the same things. The only thing I can find different is that WELS determined a long time ago that they shouldn't be in fellowship with LCMS over the understanding of fellowship, and LCMS accepted ALC into their fellowship. But both WELS and LCMS believe that we don't take Communion, worship, or pray with those that don't believe as we do. You can see my confusion. I do not see the difference between our synods except that LCMS accepts WELS ,but WELS does not accept LCMS. Our pastor actually told me he thought we were in fellowship together. Can a WELS person be married in an LCMS church or vice versa? \n\n\nDifferences between the synods exist in the areas of church and ministry, fellowship, and the roles of men and women. They are well documented on this web site.\u00a0 (Your statement about the synods\u2019 acceptance of one another is inaccurate.)\nYou may or may not be aware that representatives from WELS, LCMS and ELS (Evangelical Lutheran Synod) have met annually since 2012 to better understand each other\u2019s doctrinal positions.\nThere is nothing to prohibit the weddings referenced in your question."}
{"prompt": "Hymnals and Bible translations", "completion": "Which hymnal do WELS churches use? Also, which Bible is widely used? NIV? ESV? \n\n\nThe great majority of our congregations use Christian Worship: A Lutheran Hymnal (1993). Work is progressing on producing a new hymnal in the second half of 2021.\nCongregations determine which Bible translations they use. While many congregations in the recent past used the New International Version (1984), the introduction of the New International Version (2011) has provided congregations opportunity to examine and utilize other translations like the ESV, the Christian Standard Bible and the Evangelical Heritage Version.\nNorthwestern Publishing House, our church body\u2019s publisher, recently produced a new edition of Luther\u2019s Catechism. It is available with Scripture passages in the NIV (2011) or ESV."}
{"prompt": "Training of called workers", "completion": "From what I know, WELS and ELS train and hire exclusively from our own schools. Do other synods have the same training and consistency in hiring? \n\n\nWhat you say is true for the most part. The great majority of pastors in our synod, for example, received their education at our worker training schools. It is possible for pastors who have been trained outside our fellowship and served outside our fellowship to serve as pastors of our synod if they successfully complete a colloquy process. Other, larger Lutheran church bodies have similar but not identical practices. Each synod spells out the educational requirements for those who wish to serve as pastors. A look at their web sites will provide more information.\nIn addition to our college and seminary, WELS is especially blessed in having two synodically-owned and operated preparatory high schools and 25 area Lutheran high schools. That educational system, under God\u2019s guidance, can certainly offer consistency in the calling process, as you noted."}
{"prompt": "The Nicene Creed", "completion": "Is the Nicene Creed biblical, and where is it in the Bible? Do churches have to recite it at each service?\n\n\nThe Nicene Creed is biblical. You will not find in a book of the Bible the wording of the Nicene Creed as we speak it, but the creed does state biblical truths about God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit. It was written in 325 A.D. to address false ideas about the divinity of Jesus Christ. That explains why the second article of the Nicene Creed is longer than its counterpart in the Apostles\u2019 Creed.\nUsing creeds in our worship services is a matter of Christian freedom. There is no command of God telling us to use them or refrain from using them. Using the creeds enables us to confess our common faith."}
{"prompt": "1 Corinthians 10:31 and Christian freedom", "completion": "Hello, sir.  This is a question that's burning in my mind and actually causing problems in my family. An Anabaptist/evangelical/nondenominational relative of mine is saying that because of 1 Corinthians 10:31, we shouldn't listen to country music or drink pop. He says we should always be studying the Bible and doing godly things. I think he's missed all of the parts about grace and how we are justified by faith alone \"not by works lest any man should boast.\" Am I wrong, or is he, or both of us? Thanks and God bless. \r\n\r\n \n\n\nI would encourage you to remind your relative what the Bible teaches about Christian freedom. 1 Corinthians 10:31 (\u201cSo whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.\u201d) teaches us that we can eat and drink\u2014even soda/pop\u2014to the glory of God when actions proceed from faith in and gratitude to God for all his gracious gifts. That passage informs us that Christians can do innumerable things in life to the glory of God.\nGod\u2019s word tells us: \u201cTherefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink\u2026\u201d (Colossians 2:16). While Old Testament ceremonial laws guided the dietary practices of God\u2019s people before the coming of Christ, all those laws have been abolished; there are no New Testament ceremonial laws. The apostle Peter learned that lesson firsthand (Acts 10:15; 11:9). An individual\u2019s personal opinion about soft drinks is just that: an opinion. It cannot bind the consciences of others (1 Timothy 4:1-5).\nCan a Christian listen to music to the glory of God? Certainly. Is some music inappropriate and ungodly? Yes. Country music with themes of illicit sex and the abuse of alcohol have no place in our lives, but what about country music that emphasizes patriotism and family values? Philippians 4:8 instructs us to be discerning about the content we put into our hearts and minds. That includes music. We want to avoid music of any genre that cannot flow through the filter of Philippians 4:8, but condemning an entire genre of music without regard to content is an attack on the freedom we enjoy as God\u2019s people.\nThe book of Galatians would be a good read for you and your relative. It\u2019s an epistle that underscores our Christian freedom.\nI hope this response will be helpful to you. God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Pastors and vestments", "completion": "What is the stance on pastors wearing a robe during the service?\n\n\nThe \u201cstance\u201d we have is that this is a matter of Christian freedom. Christian Worship: Manual, the companion book to Christian Worship: A Lutheran Hymnal, explains that Lutheran pastors, historically, have worn vestments for several reasons: \u201cto identify him as the called spiritual leader of the congregation,\u201d \u201cto remind the congregation that its pastor serves as God\u2019s representative,\u201d and to connect to \u201cthe legacy of the church\u201d (pages 98-104).\nThe resource that I cited puts your question into perspective when it states: \u201cIn all aspects of the church\u2019s life of worship, artistic propriety and legitimate tradition must take second place to the proclamation of the gospel and the gospel\u2019s glorious freedom. In the final analysis the Lord Jesus will not be so concerned about either the type of vestments or the kind of liturgy Christians use. He is concerned only that we worship the Father \u2018in spirit and truth\u2019 (John 4:23).\u201d\nPastors and congregations will want to work together when thinking of changing customs and practices."}
{"prompt": "Sins of weakness", "completion": "Can you define for me what is meant by \"sins of weakness,\" and what the difference is between them and other sins?\n\n\nBy \u201csins of weakness\u201d we usually mean those sins of Christians that result from the sinful nature winning the battle against the new self even though we do not want to sin (Romans 7:15-25). As Christians, our new self delights in doing the will of God; our sinful nature wants nothing to do with godliness and what God says. Yet, sometimes in the hour of temptation, the sinful nature gets the upper hand. In those situations, there is no plan to sin, but weak people give in to temptation. That sin is followed by confession and repentance, trust in God\u2019s forgiveness and the resolve not to sin again.\nSins of weakness differ from what we can call \u201cwillful sins.\u201d Those sins take place when people know what God\u2019s will is, but don\u2019t care. Instead, they act against better knowledge\u2014and perhaps conscience\u2014and do what they want.\nRegardless of how we might define and categorize sin, sin is deadly. It needs our continual attention. The price to pay for our sins was extremely high (1 Peter 1:18-19). Our desire as God\u2019s children is now to avoid sin as best we can and live life to the glory of God (2 Corinthians 5:14-15). God help us to do just that."}
{"prompt": "The god of Mormonism", "completion": "I was reading in your Q & A that a false God doesn't save.  Is the God of Mormonism a false God?\n\n\nSadly, the god of Mormonism is a false god because it is not the Triune God of the Bible. While Mormonism (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) uses \u201cFather,\u201d \u201cSon\u201d and \u201cHoly Spirit,\u201d it attaches entirely different meanings to those words than what the Bible teaches. Mormonism does not teach that there is only one God who has revealed himself in the Bible as three distinct yet co-equal persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Mormonism teaches that Father, Son and Holy Spirit are three separate gods. In addition, they teach that human beings can become gods.\nYou may be interested in the information and resources available from Truth in Love Ministry, an organization within WELS that seeks to share biblical truths with Mormons."}
{"prompt": "Relocation and church options", "completion": "I grew up in a WELS church and attended a WELS high school. Work has taken me to a place where there are only two WELS churches in the entire state, with the closest one about 1.5 hours away. What are my options?\n\n\nI would encourage you to contact the pastor of that congregation to alert him to your situation and location. It is possible that he may be able to serve your spiritual needs in ways that you and I are not aware of at this point. It could also be that there are other WELS members in your vicinity, and that could lead to exploring options of how best to serve everyone. Your pastor could also contact the chairman of your district\u2019s mission board. This is how new mission congregations can get started.\nIn the meantime, you can find devotional materials on this web site to supplement your Bible and devotional reading. This link provides information on devotional media resources from congregations throughout our synod.\nFinally, when you searched for a WELS congregation for your new location, I\u2019m wondering if you looked also for an ELS congregation. If you use the WELS Locator tool, that will display WELS and ELS congregations in the search results.\nGod bless you!"}
{"prompt": "Clothed with Christ", "completion": "If we are clothed with Christ, does God see our sins?\n\n\nThe two main teachings of the Bible, law and gospel, have different and opposite messages. The message of the law reveals God\u2019s hatred of sin and sinners (Psalm 5:5); the message of the gospel reveals God\u2019s love of sinners. Law and gospel are opposite, but not contradictory, messages.\nAs Christians, we are clothed with Christ (Galatians 3:26-27), as you noted. We are wrapped in the righteousness Jesus won and which is given to us in Spirit-worked faith. Through faith in Jesus, Christians are holy in the sight of God (Colossians 1:22; Hebrews 2:11; 10:10; 1 Peter 2:9).\nYet, we still have a sinful nature, don\u2019t we? And we still continue to sin. That\u2019s why our Lord, in the prayer that is named after him, instructed us to petition God for forgiveness for our sins (Matthew 6:12). That same Lord intercedes on our behalf when we do sin (Romans 8:34; Hebrews 7:25).\nGod, who is omniscient, see all things\u2014including our sins. The message of the law reminds us of that truth. The message of the gospel though is that, in the case of Christians, God sees people who are entirely and completely perfect in his sight through the righteousness Jesus won and which is theirs through faith. As Christians, we stand in God\u2019s grace (Romans 5:2). Even while we are saints-sinners in this life, we have God\u2019s own word that we are free from condemnation (Romans 8:1) and we are his dearly-loved children (1 John 3:1-3)."}

{"prompt": "Witnessing to Jehovah's Witnesses", "completion": "How should we respond to Jehovah's Witnesses who come to our door?  I know just a tiny bit about them, but of course I don't want to argue with them.  What can I say?\n\n\nYou want to respond by speaking the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15) to people who need to hear the truths of God\u2019s law and God\u2019s gospel.\nYou have the right attitude in that you do not want to argue with them. You don\u2019t want to be rude to them or slam the door shut on them either. Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses are told that they can expect persecution for their beliefs. Any rude behavior they encounter only reinforces their conviction that they have right beliefs.\nYou can simply confess your faith: that Jesus Christ is the God-Man who lived perfectly in your place, and suffered and died to endure the punishment your sins deserved. Jesus\u2019 physical resurrection from the dead is proof positive that God the Father accepted Jesus\u2019 life and death as the full payment for your sins (Romans 4:25). Through faith in Jesus, you can be confident that that you are at peace with God (Romans 5:1) and that you will be in God\u2019s presence in heaven forever (Psalm 23:6).\nDon\u2019t expect the visitors at your door to automatically agree with you, but you have planted the seed and shared the truth of God\u2019s word with them. If you have time and want to engage Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in conversation, you will want to get them off their talking points. Ask them what they are doing to enjoy God\u2019s forgiveness. When they point to their deeds, show them the demands of God\u2019s law. \u201cBe perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect\u201d (Matthew 5:48). \u201cFor whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it\u201d (James 2:10). \u201cThe wages of sin is death\u201d (Romans 6:23). Share what God says in his word, that there is no salvation through people\u2019s efforts to keep his law (Romans 3:20).\nThen, direct your visitors to Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God (Matthew 26:63-64; John 8:58). Point them to Jesus\u2019 perfect life (Romans 10:4) and sacrificial death (Ephesians 1:7) as the only means by which God has forgiven the sins of people.\nIf you find yourself hosting Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses regularly at your home, you might benefit from a resource like this from Northwestern Publishing House.

{"prompt": "Sozo prayer", "completion": "What is Sozo prayer and WELS' stand on the subject?  I am concerned for a family member who may be participating in Sozo.  Thanks.\r\n\n\n\nSozo is the English transliteration of a Greek word meaning \u201cto save, to rescue, to deliver.\u201d It is a word in the New Testament that speaks of God\u2019s powerful love for people. Unfortunately, some people have co-opted that word for a ministry about which you are rightly concerned.\nSozo ministry describes itself as \u201ca unique inner healing and deliverance ministry aimed to get to the root of things hindering your personal connection with the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. With a healed connection, you can walk in the destiny to which you have been called.\u201d The premise of the ministry is that people have created false beliefs based on emotional wounds from the past. Healing supposedly results from sessions in which individuals recall and confess specific sins that have caused resulting problems, and identify and renounce satanic lies.\nObviously, God\u2019s will is that we confess our sins (Luke 13:1-5; Acts 3:19), but the descriptions of the sessions of Sozo ministry portray God communicating to people and strengthening them spiritually apart from the means of grace. \u201cThe leading of the Holy Spirit\u201d is prominent, as the individuals seeking help enter a near-trancelike state.\nIt is helpful to recognize that Sozo ministry originated with Randy Clark, a healing evangelist who is associated with the \u201choly laughter\u201d movement.\nYou would do well to speak to your family member. Ask questions for greater understanding of the situation. Point out the dangers of that ministry, and direct your family member back to Scripture. If your family member is in need of Christian counseling, suggest that he or she go that route for help and not a ministry that misrepresents God and his word. God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Mary Magdalene outside the tomb", "completion": "Please help me understand the differences in the accounts of Easter morning in the gospels of Matthew and John.  Matthew tells us that the risen Jesus met Mary Magdalene and the other Mary on the road as they were returning from the empty tomb.  John relates that Jesus came to Mary (although she at first thought he was the gardener) as she stood crying at the tomb.  I've heard some say that Mary made two trips to the tomb and that the gospels are relating different trips.  However, if that is the case, would not her reaction during the second trip have been far less shocked?  Just wondering what, if anything, I'm missing.  Of course I can always ask Mary myself when I meet her.\n\n\nJohn 20:10-18 does provide us with information on Mary Magdalene\u2019s second visit to the tomb on Easter Sunday morning.\nWhy didn\u2019t she recognize her risen Lord? There is no specific answer within the context of John 20. Mark 16:12 adds the thought that the risen Lord appeared to people with his glorified body, and in his state of exaltation Jesus interacted with people in ways that were different than during his state of humiliation.\nWhen the \u201cgardener\u201d in Joseph\u2019s garden first addressed her as \u201cWoman,\u201d Mary did not recognize her risen Lord. But when he spoke her name, everything changed!\nLike you, I too look forward to the time when we can meet and converse with people from the Bible!"}
{"prompt": "Concern for daughter", "completion": "My grown child is stumbling greatly in her faith.  Though I understand that God predestines some for heaven and does not do the opposite, I find myself stumbling in my prayers for her.  I'm afraid that if she wasn't chosen for heaven, my prayers for her are useless.  How can I accept his will, if that means my daughter will be in hell?  At the same time, I know God doesn't want anyone in hell.  I find myself going in circles.  What should my prayer be?  How can I be at peace about this?\n\n\nBecause I do not know many of the details of your situation, I hope my response will be applicable.\nA starting point is that faith is strengthened through word and sacrament. Is your daughter in touch with God\u2019s word? Is she attending worship services? Are there Christian influences in her life? If the answer is \u201cno\u201d to any of those questions, that is something for you to address with your daughter. Also, please don\u2019t underestimate your own Christian example and influence.\nRegarding your prayer life, keep praying for your daughter. None of us can peer into the heart of another person. Pray that your daughter sees life and uses life the way God has intended, and that she uses wisely the time of grace God has given her.\nJesus certainly cares about those who stumble in the faith. In his gentle treatment of people during his earthly ministry, Jesus fulfilled the prophet Isaiah\u2019s words about him: \u201cA bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out\u201d (Isaiah 42:3: Matthew 12:20). Jesus does not want to snuff out faith that is flickering; he wants to fan it into flame. But that\u2019s where the Bible and the sacrament of Holy Communion enter the picture: the Lord strengthens faith through his gospel. That\u2019s why you want your daughter to be in contact with the gospel in word and sacrament.\nBe reminded that faith in Jesus saves. The weakest of Christian faith saves. That\u2019s because salvation does not depend on the strength of our faith. Salvation depends on the strength of our Savior, and there\u2019s no one more powerful than him. He has defeated sin, death and hell for all, including your daughter.\nBe reminded also of God\u2019s general promise:\u00a0 \u201cStart children off on the way they should go, and even when they are old they will not turn from it\u201d (Proverbs 22:6).\nYou would benefit from having a conversation with your pastor. Do contact him. God bless you and your daughter."}
{"prompt": "Charismatic gifts", "completion": "Hello!  I am curious what WELS' position is on speaking in tongues, laying on of hands in healing, etc. Thank you!\r\n \r\n\r\n \n\n\nElsewhere on this web site you will find a document called This We Believe. It is a statement of belief of our church body. The fifth chapter addresses \u201cGood Works and Prayer.\u201d In that chapter we state this:\n\u201c8. We believe that the Holy Spirit enables every believer to produce good works as fruits of faith (Galatians 5:22-25). The Holy Spirit gives every believer a new nature, or \u2018new man,\u2019 that cooperates with the Holy Spirit in doing good works. The Holy Spirit uses the gospel to motivate believers to do good works.\n\u201c9. The Holy Spirit also equips the church with all the spiritual gifts it needs for its well-being (1 Corinthians 12:4-11). During the beginning of the New Testament era, special charismatic gifts were given to the church, such as signs, miracles, and speaking in tongues. These gifts were connected with the ministry of the apostles (2 Corinthians 12:12). There is no evidence in Scripture that we today should expect the continuation of such charismatic gifts.\u201d\nThis link will take you to that chapter where you can read those statements in their context."}
{"prompt": "Shaking the guilt of sin", "completion": "Lately I am feeling crushed by guilt over things I have done. I believe in God's forgiveness, but I just can't shake the guilt for my sins and how I have wronged others in my past. Most of all, how I have offended God.  Can you help me? Thank you.\n\n\nYou understand God\u2019s law very well. Any sin is an offense against God. I would like to encourage you to understand better and appreciate more in faith God\u2019s gospel. While your sins and mine are an offense to God, God says: \u201cI have swept away your offenses like a cloud, your sins like the morning mist\u201d (Isaiah 44:22). While we can have pretty good memories about the sins God has forgiven, God has a \u201cpoor memory.\u201d He forgives and forgets (Isaiah 43:25; Jeremiah 31:34). The memory of past sins can help keep us humble, but that memory can also drag us down and falsely lead us to believe that some sins remain unforgiven. The truth of the matter is that God has forgiven all our sins. If that is the case, we want to and need to forgive ourselves.\nIn the Apostles\u2019 Creed we say that we believe \u201cin the forgiveness of sins.\u201d Through faith in Jesus, we do enjoy forgiveness of sins. God has forgiven your sins. He has forgiven the guilt of your sins (Psalm 32:5). God will strengthen faith in the forgiveness of sins through his gospel in word and sacrament. As you immerse yourself more in the gospel, God will have more opportunities to deepen your faith and trust in Jesus Christ\u2014and the forgiveness you have in him.\nOn a practical note, you might find value and benefit in using the order of Private Confession on page 154 in Christian Worship with your pastor or other trusted Christian friend. In addition, if you have wronged people and have not confessed your sins to them, I encourage you to go that route (James 5:16). Above all, listen to the voice of your Savior as he speaks to you through his word: \u201cTake heart\u2026your sins are forgiven\u201d (Matthew 9:2). Jesus Christ lived perfectly for you. Jesus Christ suffered the penalty of your sins, in your place. Jesus Christ rose victoriously from the dead to assure you that his life and death were accepted as the full payment for your sins. God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Natural knowledge of God's law", "completion": "We were studying Abraham and the Isaac sacrifice.  One of the participants stated that \"Humans from creation to present were aware of the 10 commandments.\"  My reading is that the 10 Commandments were handed down in Exodus 20. Prior to that God had given no specific behavior instructions to man from the inception of creation, through Adam and Eve's sin, other than \"to not eat of the Tree of Knowledge\" and a follow-on in which Cain killed Abel, wherein murder is recognized.  I may answer my own question here - but the tree of knowledge has never been portrayed to me as 'knowledge of the specifics of the 10 commandments.   I would like some clarification as to when man actually knew all the wrongs God had ordained.\n\n\nThe Bible teaches that people have a natural knowledge of God\u2019s law (Romans 2:14-15). People naturally know that it is wrong to steal, kill, lie, etc. Apart from the Bible, people will not know these prohibitions and commands as the \u201cTen Commandments,\u201d but they will be familiar with the content of the Ten Commandments.\nGod initially \u201cwrote\u201d his law into the hearts of people, but as that knowledge became blurred over time, he spelled it out in the commandments he delivered through Moses (Exodus 20; Deuteronomy 5). The Ten Commandments remain a good summary of God\u2019s moral law: his will for all people of all time."}
{"prompt": "Granddaughter and Christianity", "completion": "When my granddaughter was born, my son (WELS baptized) informed me that she would not be forced into religion...she could choose, later in life, whether to believe or not to believe.  While this response was very troublesome to me at that time (and still is), I chose to place her into God's hand through prayer, which I have continued to do through the years.  I did not want to alienate my son and his family by repeatedly bringing up the subject (although from time to time I encouraged them to attend church services or talk with a pastor), as they themselves weren't affiliated with any church.  This spring I felt urged by God to confront my granddaughter regarding her faith, since she graduated from high school.  Her answer was that she had only a little experience with Christianity and it was not really that all that important to her.  I tried to impress upon her the reality of God, heaven, and hell - sharing the law and gospel with her.  Yet, she would not budge from her stance (of unimportance).  She will be going to college this fall.  What more can I do for her? She remains in my prayers.\n\n\nBy praying for her, you are doing much. Prayer is \u201cpowerful and effective\u201d (James 5:16). Changing hearts is the Holy Spirit\u2019s work. Keep praying that the Spirit uses any contact your granddaughter has with the gospel of Jesus Christ to change her heart. She cannot choose to believe in Jesus. No one can do that (John 15:16).\nWith the Spirit\u2019s work in mind, do what you can to share Scripture with her. Maybe it\u2019s a matter of emailing her a link to a devotion. The WELS web site has numerous devotions available. You will find good resources on the What About Jesus? web site maintained by our synod\u2019s Commission on Evangelism.\nWhen you do have face-to-face contact with your granddaughter, ask her questions about school and life. Your responses\u2014with scriptural references and inferences\u2014can be perceived as being more natural than sharing biblical truths without context.\nFinally, don\u2019t underestimate your Christian example. While the apostle Peter\u2019s words are in the context of married life, his instruction about witnessing \u201cwithout words\u201d (1 Peter 3:1) has application in life in general. God bless you and your granddaughter."}
{"prompt": "\"In the Garden\"", "completion": "I have always wondered why the song \"In the Garden\" is not accepted by  WELS. Different pastors have told me that it was not acceptable. Can you enlighten me why \"In the Garden\" is not accepted?\n\n\nI cannot speak for hymnal committees, but I can pass along what Christian Worship: Manual, the companion book to Christian Worship: A Lutheran Hymnal, states about hymns in general. It describes a good hymn as (among other things): being \u201cdoxological\u201d (praising God for his great deeds), having \u201cdoctrinal content,\u201d \u201cmaking use of the word of God,\u201d being \u201cinfluenced by the \u2018year of our Lord\u2019\u201d (recounting Jesus\u2019 holy life, innocent death and glorious resurrection) and having \u201cmelodies that support the scriptural message and touch the heart of the worshiper.\u201d \u201cIn the Garden\u201d falls short of those criteria.\nThe greatest concern about that song is the way in which the author, C. Austin Miles, speaks of God communicating with people. Miles used the backdrop of Jesus\u2019 Easter Sunday morning conversation with Mary Magdalene as the basis of his song. While Jesus spoke to Mary face-to-face \u201cin the garden\u201d that day, our Lord speaks to us through his word. While a walk in a garden can tell me that there is a God (Psalm 19:1-4; Hebrews 3:4), only in the Bible does God tell me that \u201cI am his own\u201d (Isaiah 43:1; 1 John 3:1). We want hymns in our hymnal to reinforce that truth."}
{"prompt": "Election and salvation", "completion": "I read \"Predestination Chosen in Christ\" and it explains predestination very well.  Everything made sense and is backed by Scripture.  But the one thing that I have trouble wrapping my mind around is God's election. I understand He has his own plan of whom He elects, and that He wants all to be saved. But the term election means some are chosen, while some are not. How can that be if he wants all to be saved?\n\n\nYour question addresses a mystery that our human minds cannot comprehend. With the Bible\u2019s teaching regarding salvation, we learn that God wants all to be saved (1 Timothy 2:4; 2 Peter 3:9). With the Bible\u2019s teaching regarding election, we learn that God has elected some to salvation (Ephesians 1:3-14). When it comes to people being condemned instead of enjoying salvation, the Bible puts the blame squarely on people (Jeremiah 15:6; Matthew 23:37).\nWhen we encounter teachings of the Bible that our minds cannot grasp, we do well to adopt the attitude of the apostle Paul in his doxology in the book of Romans: \u201cOh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out! \u2018Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?\u2019 \u2018Who has ever given to God, that God should repay them?\u2019 For from him and through him and for him are all things. To him be the glory forever! Amen.\u201d (Romans 11:33-36)\nThe Bible\u2019s teaching of election to salvation has the purpose of assuring us that our salvation is a sure thing: it\u2019s all God\u2019s work from beginning to end. There is nothing mysterious about that."}
{"prompt": "God and evil", "completion": "Hello,\r\nI have a takeaway from Bible study this morning that has left me troubled.  I am a WELS member, so my question following our Bible study was raised with my WELS pastor.  Here we go:\r\nGod is the creator of all things, which I take from the Word, to be everything.  If \"something\" exists, then God created it.  The discussion in Bible study was centered around, \"God did not create evil, as it is not in him.\"  I'm perfectly good with the fact that God does not do evil.  I'm onboard and 100% believe that.  But that does not mean that God does not have knowledge of it and didn't create it.  He did create the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, didn't he?  My argument is simply God created everything including the knowledge of evil.  If God didn't create the \"knowledge of evil,\" then it wouldn't exist.  Where am I going wrong?\n\n\nI think you want to revisit your statement: \u201cIf \u2018something\u2019 exists, then God created it.\u201d That was true when God finished his work during creation week and pronounced it all \u201cvery good\u201d (Genesis 1:31). What did not exist at that time was sin, evil.\nWhen we get to the third chapter of Genesis, we encounter Satan, a fallen angel who appeared in the form of a serpent. Through his temptation, sin entered the world. Sin, evil, has existed ever since, but God did not create it. The Bible makes it clear that God is not responsible for the existence of sin (Psalm 5:4; James 1:13-15).\nCertainly God knew that his perfect world would become corrupted by sin. While God could have prevented that from happening, he did not. The Bible does not tell us why. Still, God\u2019s knowledge of future evil does not make him responsible for it.\nThe placement of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil\u2014and the command not to eat from it\u2014provided Adam and Eve with tangible opportunities to show their love and devotion to God. When they disobeyed God\u2019s command, there were grave consequences. Yet, God promised a Savior (Genesis 3:15). Jesus Christ came into the world as true man in fulfillment of that promise to deliver us from sin, death and the power of the devil. Thanks be to God."}
{"prompt": "Gluten-free Communion wafers", "completion": "Many members of my family have celiac disease. When the first member was diagnosed, our pastor graciously obtained a gluten-free host for use by congregation members who must be gluten-free. That worked well for several years; recently, however, a family member ingested a small amount of gluten at Communion. Whether that was due to the manufacture of the host or subsequent handling we do not know. We are deeply troubled by this event because at other times gluten caused a couple of family members to go the emergency room. We are seeking options for taking Communion safely, including making the gluten-free host ourselves and bringing it to the Communion rail with us. What constraints should we keep in mind as we evaluate the options?\n\n\nYou definitely want to bring these concerns to your pastor. He needs to know about them.\nAs the far as the elements of the Lord\u2019s Supper are concerned, your pastor is responsible for consecrating them for use in the Supper. That would include gluten-free wafers. They would be included with the regular wafers and wine at the time when they are consecrated and distributed."}

How can I comfort her when she sees her Grandmother's body in the casket at the funeral and the thought of her being buried? \n\n\nFirst, may you and your family find peace and strength in the victory over death which Jesus secured by his resurrection and which he shares with those joined to him in faith.\nYou could explain to your daughter that each person consists of two parts: one part that we can see (the body) and one part that we cannot see (the soul). When a person dies, the part that we can see remains on earth, while the part we cannot see goes to God\u2019s presence in heaven (in the case of a Christian). The part that we can see does not have any life in it, but the part we cannot see is very much alive in the presence of God. One day, on the last day, God will join that person\u2019s body and soul together, and life will continue that way forever. For the Christian that life will be perfect and glorious.\nI hope this gives you some ideas. God bless you and your family."}
{"prompt": "Psalm 119 Ministries", "completion": "I have a nephew wrapped up with \"Psalm 119 Ministries,\" which is a cult, following the Torah and observing the Sabbath on Saturday and \"obeying\" other practices and commands of Moses. They don't observe Christmas or Easter because they are \"pagan\" celebrations.  Also the \"Trinity\" is out the window!  All church denominations are \"wrong\" because they worship \"doctrines of men.\"  Being in strict \"obedience\" to the Torah is paramount!  They acknowledge Jesus as the Messiah and Redeemer, but that is always in the background. I have used St. Paul's epistles, especially Galatians, but he always says it is so easy to twist Paul's words.  Is there anything you could encourage me with that I might not have tried?\n\n\nThe organization you referenced does speak of the Trinity, but they promote significant errors in their Statement of Faith. They speak of multiple judgments before God and a literal 1,000-year reign of Christ on earth. I found no mention of the sacraments in their Statement of Faith. Their misunderstanding of Old Testament ceremonial laws is evident in this statement: \u201cAll Scripture (Word) is still true and nothing has been abolished.\u201d The ceremonial laws have been abolished. The tearing of the temple curtain on Good Friday illustrated that (Matthew 27:51).\nThe book of Galatians was a good part of the Bible to share with your nephew. Nothing is being twisted when you point to clear words like these: \u201cFormerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods. But now that you know God\u2014or rather are known by God\u2014how is it that you are turning back to those weak and miserable forces? Do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again? You are observing special days and months and seasons and years! I fear for you, that somehow I have wasted my efforts on you\u201d (4:8-11).\nChristian freedom is one of the great themes of Galatians. The book of Colossians also highlights that theme of Christian freedom (cf. especially 2:16-17).\nWhat can you do for your nephew? First, recognize that only God can change a person\u2019s heart and mind. He does that through his word, so keep sharing appropriate Scripture passages with your nephew. The WELS web site has numerous devotions available. Perhaps you could share ones that are especially appropriate to his circumstances.\nIn addition, keep praying that God leads your nephew to see and confess the truths of his word. Prayer is powerful and effective (James 5:16).\nAlso, as you engage your nephew in conversation about his faith, ask questions. You are not looking to back him into a corner; you are seeking to understand more what he believes and where he thinks he has scriptural support for his beliefs. His answers can help determine direction for your witnessing\u2014either at that time or in the future. God bless your efforts to testify to the truths of his word!"}

The kind of images in your question are going to appeal to our sinful nature. That explains why Jesus said in the sermon on the mount: \u201cYou have heard that it was said, \u2018You shall not commit adultery.\u2019 But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart\u201d (Matthew 5:27-28).\nPhilippians 4:8 explains what we want to put into our hearts and minds: \u201cFinally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable\u2014if anything is excellent or praiseworthy\u2014think about such things.\u201d\nIt is often true that the best button on the TV remote is labeled \u201cOff.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Souls and death", "completion": "How does Genesis 2:7 prove immortality of the soul? It clearly says the man became a living soul; not that he had a living soul.  All people, all living souls, sin. Ezekiel 18:4 says the soul that sins dies. Thanks.\n\n\nGenesis 2:7 speaks of God giving life to Adam, just as God had given life to animals and birds (Genesis 1:30). Where Adam and Eve differed from the animal life around them, of course, was that they consisted of body and soul. Scripture passages like Ecclesiastes 12:7; Matthew 10:28; Matthew 16:26; 2 Corinthians 5:6-9; Revelation 6:9 and Revelation 20:4 speak clearly of the soul that exists beyond the death of the body.\nEzekiel 18:4 does speak of sin\u2019s consequence: death. With the basic idea of \u201cseparation\u201d in mind, the Bible speaks of three different kinds of death: physical, spiritual and eternal. Physical death means that the body and soul which were together during life on earth are separated. Spiritual death describes the unbeliever who is physically alive on earth right now but who is separated from the forgiveness of sins. Eternal death is the fate of an unbeliever whose life on earth comes to an end: the person is in hell, forever separated from God and his love.\nEzekiel 18:4 uses the word \u201csoul\u201d to describe a person. The 2011 NIV reflects that with this translation: \u201cThe one who sins is the one who will die.\u201d We can use similar language when we speak of congregational membership totaling \u201c850 souls.\u201d\nPhysical death is not the end of a person. When physical death takes place, the body and soul are separated. There is immediate judgment (Hebrews 9:27). Souls are in heaven or hell, based on faith or unbelief in the heart. On the last day the Lord will raise the bodies of all who have died, reunite bodies with souls, and people\u2014with body and soul\u2014will be in God\u2019s presence or be shut of his presence forever (John 5:28-29). This is why our Lord tells us to take care of the needs of our soul first and foremost (Matthew 16:26)."}

{"prompt": "Tithing and God's blessings", "completion": "My question is about tithing. I'm running across people who seem to think that if you tithe that God will bless you generously in a financial way. They cite Malachi 3. I've read it, and it appears to say what they say it says. What does WELS say?\n\n\nTithing, in general, was the subject of the question asked and answered in the June 2017 \u201cLight for our path\u201d column in Forward in Christ. This link will take you to that column.\nRegarding your specific question, God\u2019s people had not been giving back to him as he had instructed them. Were the people thinking that they would have more possessions if they gave less than God commanded? That\u2019s how human math can work. In Malachi 3 God instructed his people to give what he commanded and then see if he didn\u2019t take care of them\u2014and then some.\nElsewhere in the Bible we can find additional promises from God to bless faithful management of his possessions. Consider these verses from the book of Proverbs\u20143:9-10; 11:24; and, 22:9. See also what Jesus said in Luke 6:38.\nAn important point to keep in mind is the motivation behind the gifts that we give back to God. We do not give to get additional blessings from God.

{"prompt": "Follow up to question on salvation and election", "completion": "Thank you for your Q&A site.  It is a valuable resource for understanding the truth of God\u2019s word.  A recent posting (\u201cElection and salvation\u201d) indicated that God\u2019s desire that all be saved (1 Timothy 2:4; 2 Peter 3:9) and God\u2019s election to salvation (Ephesians 1:3-14) when taken together constitute a mystery that human minds cannot comprehend.  But a general desire by God for the salvation of all need not be in conflict with God\u2019s specific actions on election, even to a human mind.  For example, they might be reconciled as follows:\r\n1.  God wants all people to be saved (1 Timothy 2:4) by living perfect and holy lives (Matthew 5:48), but unfortunately none do (Romans 3:23).\r\n2.  So God sent His Son Jesus into the world to so that people could be saved by believing in Him (John 3:16; Romans 3:24).\r\n3.  God wants all people to be saved (1 Timothy 2:4) by believing in Jesus of their own free will (Matthew 23:37a), but unfortunately none do (Matthew 23:37b; 1 Corinthians 2:14).\r\n4.  So God sends His Spirit into the world to build faith in the hearts of those he elects (1 Corinthians 12:3; Ephesians 1:3-14) in order to build His church on earth.\r\nDo you see a problem with this interpretation?  Thanks again.\r\n\n\n\nThank you for your kind words. I have no problem with people having a better grasp of the Bible\u2019s mysteries than I do. We can always grow in our knowledge of the Bible and our Christian faith (2 Peter 3:18).\nYou certainly are correct in noting that people fail to live holy lives that God demands, that God provides forgiveness of sins through Jesus\u2019 redeeming work and that the Holy Spirit is responsible for bringing people to saving faith. (With regard to your third statement, people do not have free will to believe in Jesus. All people can do by nature is reject Jesus as their Savior.)\nWhat I wonder about is the intended meaning of your fourth statement. The wording (\u201cSo\u2026\u201d) can lead to the understanding that God\u2019s election was in response to people\u2019s actions of some kind. Election took place in eternity, before God ever said, \u201cLet there be\u2026\u201d Election took place before sin entered the world and before Jesus carried out his redeeming work. Your fourth statement seems to put election \u201cin time\u201d rather than in eternity.\nThe previous question that you referenced laid out the two biblical statements, \u201cGod wants all to be saved\u201d and \u201cGod has elected some,\u201d to show how the Bible\u2019s doctrine of salvation and doctrine of election present challenges to our understanding.\nWhat is clear to minds that have been enlightened by the Holy Spirit is that God\u2019s word remains true even if we cannot fully grasp its meaning. Christian faith does not mean that I understand perfectly what God has said in his word; it means that, through the power of the Holy Spirit, I believe what God says in his word (Hebrews 11:1). May that faith always be ours!"}

{"prompt": "Forgiving others", "completion": "What is personal forgiveness? I do not want to hold any grudges, but how do I know if I've forgiven? Online I see sites titled with \"5 steps to forgive\" or \"Have you personally forgiven someone?\" I will not look at those sites.  This is not a work of oneself but the Holy Spirit. I do pray that others, different people, come to the Lord to trust Him and be forgiven in Christ. This \"forgiveness question\" has bothered me for quite a while and I do not know why. I have prayed earnestly about this. I'm not even sure sometimes what my question is! I know that the Lord will settle me.\n\n\nIf a fellow Christian has sinned against us and confesses that sin to us, we are to forgive (Luke 17:3-4). Forgiving other people in general is what God looks for us to do (Matthew 6:12; 18:21-35). Jesus warns against withholding forgiveness (Matthew 6:15).\nWhat if someone who has sinned against us does not confess that sin to us and remains impenitent? In that and every situation the Bible instructs us to \u201cGet rid of all bitterness, rage and anger\u2026\u201d (Ephesians 4:31). We may or may not have the opportunity to say to such a person: \u201cEven though you have sinned against me and have not confessed your sin to me, I forgive you and do not harbor any animosity toward you. I do not like what you did, but I forgive you because my God tells me to do that. Your sin is between you and God. I pray that you confess your sin to him so you can enjoy his forgiveness\u201d (1 John 1:8-10)\u00a0 If we do not have opportunity to have that conversation, those ideas at least reflect what is in our hearts as God\u2019s children.\nI hope thoughts like these address your situation."}
{"prompt": "Old Testament believers", "completion": "Did people who died before Jesus died on the cross go to heaven if they had faith?\n\n\nYes. Enjoying salvation is matter of trusting in the Savior who was going to come into the world (in the case of Old Testament believers) or trusting in the Savior who has come into the world (in the case of New Testament believers). It made no difference if people lived and died before Jesus carried out his redeeming work on this earth. If people had faith in the promised Messiah in their hearts, they enjoyed forgiveness in this life and entered God\u2019s presence in heaven upon death.\nConsider what the writer to the Hebrews said about Abraham and other Old Testament believers: \u201cAll these people were still living by faith when they died. They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance, admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on earth. People who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own. If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had opportunity to return. Instead, they were longing for a better country\u2014a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them\u201d (Hebrews 11:13-16).\nOld Testament and New Testament believers form the group the apostle John saw in one of the visions God gave him (Revelation 7:1-8)."}
{"prompt": "Coping with the loss of a pet", "completion": "I would speak to my pastor about this, but he is brand new to our church, and he does not know me (more than a hello here and there), nor my background, and I don't want to come across as sounding weird to him.  I have read the other questions submitted about animals or our personal pets in heaven.  I recently lost my dog.  He was more than that to me.  He was a service animal, a therapy dog who visited local hospitals, nursing homes, schools, etc.  He was my first dog ever, and he was my best friend.  He even visited the kids at our church's school on several occasions.  I am heartbroken.  I am going to work because I have to, and staying busy there to not think about it.  But, once I am home, I am a mess.  I want to seek God's comfort, but I feel bad, especially if there ends up being no animals or our pets in heaven.  I know that none of us will ever know this until we get there.  I haven't gone to church in the past few weeks because of this.  I know God is my refuge in troubles, but is losing my dog considered one?  I don't want God to be angry at me because I haven't gone to church, but I also don't want to be praying to him for unattainable things either.  \n\n\nAs one who has had dogs for pets most of my life, I can appreciate your question. As you noted, the Bible is silent on the subject of animals (and our earthly pets) being in the new heaven and the new earth. We do know that God will meet our every need and we will have perfect joy (Revelation 21:1-4).\nScripture does not define or limit \u201ctrouble\u201d when it says that \u201cGod is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble\u201d (Psalm 46:1). God stands ready to be your refuge and to strengthen you in your loss. He also says to you, \u201cCall on me in the day of trouble\u201d (Psalm 50:15). God does not define or limit \u201ctrouble\u201d in that verse either.\nWith that in mind, I encourage you to return to your church family for worship. God provides strength through his gospel in word and sacrament. God can provide strength through the encouragement of fellow believers\u2014including your pastor. Don\u2019t keep your distance from him thinking that your trouble is strange or unimportant. Do seek his counsel.\nI certainly do not want to be insensitive to your loss, so please receive this last suggestion in the caring spirit in which it is given. While our pets are unique and perhaps not replaceable, you can consider filling the void in your life with another dog. If he was your service animal, finding another dog may already be in the works.\nOur God shows his kindness and love to us each day in so many ways. Providing companionship through pets is one of those ways. For that we thank him.\u00a0 God bless you."}

{"prompt": "Explaining non-participation in Holy Communion", "completion": "I am a WELS member, but my granddaughter is a member of a non_ denominational church. During home Bible studies, they serve Holy Communion. I do not participate but am not sure how to explain in a loving way why I do not participate. We are visiting them out of state.\n\n\nBy a common confession of Jesus Christ as Savior, you and your granddaughter can both belong to the \u201choly Christian church, the communion of saints\u201d (the Apostles\u2019 Creed). We sometimes refer to that church as the \u201cinvisible church\u201d because only God can see what is in a person\u2019s heart (1 Samuel 16:7; 2 Timothy 2:19).\nYou and your granddaughter belong to different \u201cvisible churches.\u201d We use that term because we can see who the members are. Your granddaughter\u2019s membership in her church sends the signal that what her church confesses and teaches is what she believes. Similarly, your membership in your church sends the signal that your faith and your church\u2019s teachings are parallel. Because you and your granddaughter represent churches that do not agree in what the Bible teaches, the picture of unity expressed by receiving Holy Communion with others (1 Corinthians 10:17) would be contrived and not genuine.\nA very serious matter is what your granddaughter\u2019s church (a non-denominational church) teaches about Holy Communion. If her church\u2019s teachings are representative of non-denominational churches in general, then there is a denial of the real presence of Jesus\u2019 body and blood. If you were to participate in that holy meal with members of your granddaughter\u2019s church, your actions would be saying that you are one with them in doctrine.\nAs you speak the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15) to your granddaughter, you can explain that it is love for God\u2019s word, love for your own soul and love for the souls of others that is compelling you to refrain from receiving Holy Communion in that home Bible study setting. God bless your conversation."}
{"prompt": "Church bells", "completion": "I have been searching for resources on using a bell as a call to worship.  I have found many resources describing the history and the different uses of a bell.  I am looking specifically for a resource that would indicate the number of times a bell should be rung for a standard worship service.  As our bell is outside (not near the sanctuary), it is not used during the Lord's Prayer (one ring at the start, one in the middle, and one at the end.)  I realize that this is an adiaphoron, but many traditionalists expect the bell to ring.  There is a bit of discussion on the exact number of times it should ring.  Thank you for your time and consideration.\n\n\nChristian Worship: Occasional Services offers these guidelines for ringing church bells:\n\u201cChurch bells are used primarily to call people to worship and to announce the beginning of a service. In some areas it is also customary to ring the church bells to express joy, announce a death, to remind people to pray, and to encourage the absent to join in the prayers of the Church. These guidelines list some of the ways in which church bells have traditionally been used, though local customs may differ. Bells may be rung:\n1) On Saturday evening at 6:00 PM to anticipate the celebration of the coming day (seven times)\n2) Early Sunday morning to announce the arrival of the day (seven times)\n3) One-half hour and one-quarter hour before each service (seven times) to call people to worship\n4) At the hour of each service (seven times, a pause, then three single notes) to announce the beginning of worship\n5) On weekdays at the early morning, noon, and evening (three times, a pause, then seven times) to remind the community to pray\n6) At a marriage\u2014when the service begins (seven times), when the bridal party leaves the church\n7) At a death\u2014at intervals of three to seven seconds to announce the death of a member of the congregation (sometimes tolling once for each year of the age of the deceased), when the funeral service begins (seven times), as the body is carried from the church\n8) During the Lord\u2019s Prayer (beginning, middle, and end) at all services to invite those who are absent to join in praying the Lord\u2019s Prayer\n9) At the Easter Vigil as the lights of the church are fully lit and during the Easter greeting to sound the Church\u2019s joy at the resurrection of Christ.\u201d (Page 334)\nKeep in mind that these are guidelines only.

{"prompt": "The \"holy angel\" of Luther's prayers", "completion": "I've asked this several times, but I'll try again.  In Luther's morning and evening prayer it ends with \"let your holy angel be with me.......\"  Question:  who is the \"holy angel\"?  Thank you.  \n\n\nYour question was answered on April 12, 2017. Answers to questions are emailed to the questioners via the email address provided. (You want to check all your email folders for the response.) Answers to questions are also posted on the web site.\nHere is the answer that was emailed and posted this past April:\n\u201cThe holy angels are those angels who did not join in with Satan and other angels in rebelling against God (2 Peter 2:4). The holy angels are \u2018ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation\u2019 (Hebrews 1:14). The holy angels carry out God\u2019s command \u2018to guard you in all your ways\u2019 (Psalm 91:11). The \u2018holy angel\u2019 in Martin Luther\u2019s prayers references any of the heavenly host whom God might choose to use to carry out his good and gracious will in our lives. Might God use a single angel on occasion? Yes. Might he use more than one angel on occasion? Yes.\n\u201cThe Bible does not state specifically that God has assigned a guardian angel to each Christian. While it would be comforting to know that God has matched one angel to us for life-time service and protection, it is even more comforting to know that God employs angels\u2014plural\u2014in his providential care of each Christian.\n\u201cGod\u2019s gracious use of angels in our lives provides another reason for praising God. \u2018Lord God, to you we all give praise; To you our joyful hymns we raise That angel hosts you did create Around your glorious throne to wait. But watchful is the angel band That follows Christ on ev\u2019ry hand To guard his people where they go And break the counsel of the foe. O Lord, awaken songs of praise For angel hosts that guard our days; Teach us to serve you and adore As angels do forevermore.\u2019\u201d (Christian Worship 196:1, 5-6)"}

{"prompt": "Marriage service promises", "completion": "I am in a serious relationship with a WELS man and we have been talking about marriage. I was raised Catholic but identify now as Christian. I do not want to become a member of WELS, but I don't have a problem having a WELS ceremony. However, does a WELS wedding require the verse about being an obedient wife? Is there any other verse about marriage in the Bible that can be said? I make my own money, I make dinner, I shop, I do everything a man does and I make decisions with my man as an equal and that is not what that verse seems to convey I should be doing. I really do not want this verse read, as it would be a broken promise to God.\n\n\nThe order of \u201cChristian Marriage\u201d in Christian Worship: A Lutheran Hymnal contains this preface to the marriage promises made by the bride and groom:\n\u201cThe pattern for Christian marriage is the intimate union of Christ and his church, which the apostle Paul depicts in Ephesians 5. After urging believers to \u2018submit to one another out of reverence for Christ,\u2019 he makes this application for Christian spouses: \u2018Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church\u2026Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself for her.\u2019 It is reverence for Christ on the part of husband and wife that lays the foundation for Christian marriage.\u201d\nThe wording of the marriage promise by the bride is: \u201c_____, will you take _____ to be your husband? Will you be guided by the counsel and direction God has given in his Word and submit to your husband as the Church submits to Christ? Will you be faithful to him, cherish him, support him, and help him in sickness and in health as long as you both shall live?\u2019 If so, answer, \u2018I will.\u2019\u201d\nThe word \u201csubmit\u201d can be greatly misunderstood. It can seem that it is demeaning, degrading and insulting to submit to another person. That misunderstanding is removed when we keep in mind the context of God\u2019s instructions for Christian wives: \u201cAs the church submits to Christ\u2026\u201d There is nothing demeaning, degrading or insulting when we, the members of the Christian Church, submit to Christ. Submitting to him means we have an attitude of recognizing his loving leadership in our lives.\nAnd, just to complete the picture, the husband is asked in his marriage promise: \u201c_____, will you take _____ to be your wife? Will you guided by the counsel and direction God has given in his Word and love your wife as Christ loved the Church? Will you be faithful to her, cherish her, support her, and help her in sickness and in health as long as you both shall live? If so, answer, \u2018I will.\u2019\u201d The husband to whom the wife submits is promising that his love for his wife will be like that of Christ\u2019s: sacrificial.\nIt is clear that the marriage promises between husband and wife are based on the loving relationship between Jesus Christ and the Christian Church.\nThe WELS church where your marriage service could take place may use this order of service, with this wording, or it might utilize something similar. You would want to contact the pastor of that church regarding the order of service and the wording of the marriage promises."}
{"prompt": "Brothers and sisters in the faith", "completion": "What view does WELS have concerning the Roman Catholic Church?  When I was an Orthodox Presbyterian, the Catholic Church was considered a false church.  Three years ago I became a member of the LCMS.  The LCMS considers Catholics to be our brothers in Christ.  Does the WELS consider Roman Catholics to be our Christian brothers and sisters?\r\n\n\n\nThis We Believe, a statement of belief of our church body, makes this profession:\n\u201c1. We believe that there is one holy Christian church, which is the temple of God (1 Corinthians 3:16) and the body of Christ (Ephesians 1:23; 4:12). The members of this one church are all those who are the \u2018sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus\u2019 (Galatians 3:26). The church, then, consists only of believers, or saints, whom God accepts as holy for the sake of Jesus\u2019 righteousness, which has been credited to them (2 Corinthians 5:21). These saints are scattered throughout the world. All people who believe that Jesus is their Savior from sin are members of the holy Christian church, regardless of the nation, race, or church body to which they belong.\n\u201c2. We believe that this holy Christian church is a reality, although it is not an external, visible organization. Because \u2018man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart\u2019 (1 Samuel 16:7), only the Lord knows \u2018those who are his\u2019 (2 Timothy 2:19). The members of the holy Christian church are known only to God; we cannot distinguish between true believers and hypocrites. The holy Christian church is therefore invisible and cannot be identified with any one church body or with the total membership of all church bodies.\n\u201c3. We believe that the presence of the holy Christian church nevertheless can be recognized. Wherever the gospel is preached and the sacraments are administered, the holy Christian church is present, for through the means of grace true faith is produced and preserved (Isaiah 55:10,11). The means of grace, therefore, are called the marks of the church.\u201d\nThe preceding paragraphs explain that we can have brothers and sisters in the faith \u201cwherever the gospel is preached and the sacraments are administered.\u201d When the Holy Spirit works through the gospel and leads people to confess that Jesus Christ is their Savior from sin, those people are our brothers and sisters in the faith.\nBut you recognize from the preceding paragraphs that we\u2019re speaking about the invisible church: the holy Christian church, the communion of saints. God alone knows who belongs to that church; God alone can see what is in a person\u2019s heart.\nYou and I operate in the world of visible churches\u2014where we can see who the members are. So, when people join a church, their membership implies their faith is parallel to what their church teaches. In the context of your question, that means that people who belong to the Roman Catholic Church state by their membership that they believe what that church teaches. As the Roman Catholic Church is a heterodox church, one hopes that the people who belong to it disregard their church\u2019s wrong teachings about salvation and trust only in Jesus Christ for their salvation. If that is the case, then they too are part of the holy Christian Church, the communion of saints."}

He did that to proclaim his victory over Satan and hell and death (1 Peter 3:18-20). Afterwards, also on Easter Sunday, Jesus appeared to his followers.

{"prompt": "Indulgence sales in the Middle Ages", "completion": "How do I respond to my Catholic friends who insist that the Papacy/Pope Leo X was not responsible for the abuse of indulgence sales in the Middle Ages?\r\n\r\nThanks very much.\n\n\nYou can refer your friends to Roman Catholic sources which acknowledge Leo X\u2019s involvement in the abuse of indulgence sales. One such source is The Catholic Encyclopedia. It has the designations of nihil obstat and imprimatur, indicating that the Roman Catholic Church has reviewed the contents and declared the work to be free from doctrinal or moral errors. It is available online.\nThe Catholic Encyclopedia offers a summary of Leo X\u2019s life and pontificate. The following information from the Encyclopedia is pertinent to your question: \u201cThe immediate cause [of the Reformation] was bound up with the odious greed for money displayed by the Roman Curia, and shows how far short all efforts at reform had hitherto fallen. Albert of Brandenburg, already Archbishop of Magdeburg, received in addition the Archbishopric of Mainz and the Bishopric of Hallerstadt, but in return was obliged to collect 10,000 ducats, which he was taxed over and above the usual confirmation fees. To indemnify hiim [sic], and to make it possible to discharge these obligations Rome permitted him to have preached in his territory the plenary indulgence promised all those who contributed to the new St. Peter\u2019s; he was allowed to keep one half the returns, a transaction which brought dishonour on all concerned in it. Added to this, abuses occurred during the preaching of the Indulgence. The money contributions, a mere accessory, were frequently the chief object, and the \u2018Indulgences for the Dead\u2019 became a vehicle of inadmissible teachings. That Leo X, in the most serious of all the crises which threatened the Church, should fail to prove the proper guide for her, is clear enough from what has been related above. He recognized neither the gravity of the situation nor the underlying causes of the revolt. Vigorous measures of reform might have proved an efficacious antidote, but the pope was deeply entangled in political affairs and allowed the imperial election to overshadow the revolt of Luther; moreover, he gave himself up unrestrainedly to his pleasures and failed to grasp fully the duties of his high office.\u201d\nAnother source\u2014with the Roman Catholic Church\u2019s approval of its contents\u2014that I have in my library is The Question Box. It also acknowledges the abuse of indulgence sales during the Middle Ages: \u201cCatholic historians have frequently mentioned the abuses connected with the preaching of indulgences in the Middle Ages\u2026In the Middle Ages when men wished to build a church or support a worthy charity, the Bishop or the Pope granted an indulgence\u2026While Catholics believe that the building of St. Peter\u2019s in Rome was a matter of interest to the whole Catholic world, they heartily condemn the manner of financing the indulgence, and the exaggerations of the preachers in extolling unduly its effects and privileges\u201d (pages 59-60).\nChurch history may contain embarrassing episodes, but they cannot be denied or ignored."}
{"prompt": "God's blessings on people's earthly lives", "completion": "Could you explain to me about the different levels in heaven?  I was told that the people who do the greatest works on earth will get the upper levels in heaven.  I have a hard time with this because it sounds like work righteousness.  I believe that Jesus did it all, and that the things we do on this earth do not get us to heaven.  So why then would there be a special place in heaven for people who did better works?  I am confused.  Thank you.\n\n\nRather than speaking of different levels of heaven (something which Mormons teach), the Bible describes \u201cdegrees of glory\u201d that God\u2019s people will experience throughout eternity. Scripture passages such as Daniel 12:3; Matthew 25:23, 28-29; Luke 19:17, 19; 1 Corinthians 3:12-15; 2 Corinthians 9:6; and, Revelation 14:13 are often cited in connection with \u201cdegrees of glory.\u201d That expression describes God\u2019s gracious blessing of Christians\u2019 lives of service to him\u2014blessings that are graciously given in proportion to their lives of sanctification. This action on God\u2019s part is due entirely to his gracious love; Christians do not earn or merit any blessings from God.\nYou are correct in noting that \u201cJesus did it all\u201d when it comes to our salvation. Our works do not contribute in any way to what Jesus did to save us by living perfectly in our place and suffering the punishment our sins deserved. The works associated with the degrees of glory are not connected to the reason for our salvation. Christians do those works in gratitude for the salvation Jesus won for them. However God blesses those works is up to him. Since sin and its effects will not be present for God\u2019s children in eternity, there will be no jealousy or envy in regard to how God blesses people\u2019s earthly lives of sanctification. God\u2019s children will enjoy equally his gift of salvation (Romans 6:23)."}
{"prompt": "\"Inheritance\" in Ephesians 5:5", "completion": "In Ephesians 5:5, what does the word \"inheritance\" refer to? Does this mean that believers who go to heaven will not receive \"treasure in heaven\" (Matthew 6:19-21; 1 Timothy 6:17-19)? Or does this mean that any person (even a believer) who is \"immoral, impure or greedy\" will not get into heaven at all?\n\n\n\u201cInheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God\u201d in Ephesians 5:5 refers to eternal life with God in heaven. The warning in that verse is that impenitent sinners are barred from God\u2019s kingdom. 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 offers a similar warning.\nWarnings like those in Scripture explain why God earnestly desires that the message of repentance and forgiveness of sins through Jesus be spread to all people (Luke 24:46-47; Acts 3:19-20)."}
{"prompt": "Application of the fourth commandment", "completion": "My question is regarding honoring your parents.  What do you tell a friend whose parents were verbally and physically (molesting) abusive towards them growing up?  Should this friend honor her parents now that she is an adult?\n\n\nOur Catechism explains that, according to the fourth commandment, \u201cWe should fear and love God that we do not dishonor or anger our parents and others in authority, but honor, serve, and obey them, and give them love and respect.\u201d That explanation is based on Scripture passages like Exodus 20:12 and Ephesians 6:3.\nThe fourth commandment teaches that God places representatives over us in the areas of the home, the government and the church. That arrangement is intended to be for our good. It goes without saying that those who represent God in those areas might do well in representing him, or they might fail in representing him accurately. Your question indicates that your friend\u2019s parents failed at representing God faithfully.\nSo what is she to do? While her parents are still in a position of honor and respect because of the fourth commandment, their past actions have done much to destroy trust and greatly reduce respect. I would encourage your friend to call her parents to repentance. Her parents need to hear how they violated God\u2019s law. They need to hear about the appropriate follow-up topics of confession of sins, absolution and the fruits of repentance.\nI would also encourage your friend not to harbor any personal animosity toward her parents (Ephesians 4:26, 31) and to let go of any other attitudes that are dangerous to her own spiritual life (Matthew 6:14-15). Your friend needs to put her parents\u2019 situation in God\u2019s hands.\nFinally, I would encourage your friend to seek Christian counseling. Her pastor can help and also direct her to appropriate resources. God bless your service of Christian love to your friend."}
{"prompt": "Use of incense in worship services", "completion": "I am wondering what position the Lutheran church has on the use of incense in worship services, as I know is done during Catholic services. Did the Lutheran church ever use this and, if it was discontinued, why? Thank you.\n\n\nWe do not have a formal position on the use of incense in worship services. The practice is in the category of those things that God neither commands nor forbids.\nI would say the use of incense has been a rare practice in the Lutheran church in general and an even rarer practice in our church body because of its association with the forms of worship of Roman Catholic churches and Orthodox churches.\nIn our church body the practice has been utilized in special worship services and in conjunction with the Evening Prayer canticle, \u201cLet my prayer rise before you as incense\u201d (Psalm 141:2)."}
{"prompt": "Disunity in congregational life", "completion": "I have been a WELS member my whole life. I am having issues with my church at the moment. If I have a problem, I am supposed to talk to that person, according to Mathew 18. Hard as it is, I would like to talk to my pastor, but he and the church council are involved in the problem. Who do I seek counsel with?  I am lost.  I don't know what to do. I believe they have lied and been sneaky to do things their way.  I don't even know if I can talk to my pastor in a calm manner.  I am truly saddened.  I type these words with a heavy heart. What do I do?   \n\n\nYou have noted correctly that you need to talk to the person involved: your pastor. If you believe he has done something wrong, then Matthew 18:15 instructs you to speak to him. While it could be a difficult conversation, as you suggest, it is the right conversation to have. Speaking to your congregation\u2019s board of elders would be your next course of action. If those conversations do not yield positive and appropriate results, you could contact your circuit pastor. He serves as a representative of your district president to help at times like these.\nDisunity in a congregation is definitely disconcerting. It runs contrary to God\u2019s design for the communal life of his children. When sin disrupts unity, sin needs to be addressed. That applies to everyone in the church.\n\u201cHow good and pleasant it is when God\u2019s people live together in unity!\u201d (Psalm 133:1). Christian unity is a gift and blessing from God.

{"prompt": "Help with witnessing efforts", "completion": "I have been discussing religion with one of my coworkers a lot lately. He is the son of a Baptist pastor and is very knowledgeable. Today we got on the topic of what is different with our religions and there were a lot more than I originally thought. The four I really noticed were Baptism, the Lord's Supper, forgiveness, and fellowship.  What are verses that I can use to show that Baptism creates faith, gives us forgiveness and salvation, and more importantly is not something that we do for God, but something God does for us? Also the same with the Lord's Supper:  we get forgiveness of sins and salvation from it, but I believe the issue with this would be tied to the fact that we believe that the wine is both wine and blood and the bread is both bread and Jesus' body. What are some passages for this as well? He also said that only God can forgive.  I don't know how to even address this topic with him, but I know it will come up. And the final one is where do we find the OK to have the rules we have about fellowship without looking like we are better than other Christians? I just would like to be prepared for my discussion with my coworker and I'm glad to do it.  I just need some extra help. Thank you very much for your help!\n\n\nWe will not find a passage in the Bible that states specifically and succinctly: \u201cBaptism creates faith.\u201d We know that baptism is a faith-working act on God\u2019s part by looking at several Bible passages and seeing how they relate to baptism. The Bible explains that people enjoy the forgiveness of sins and eternal life by God\u2019s grace through faith in Jesus Christ his Son (Ephesians 2:8; Romans 3:28). The Bible states that baptism gives people those very blessings of life and forgiveness (Acts 2:38; 22:16; Ephesians 5:26; Titus 3:5-7; 1 Peter 3:21). Baptism gives those blessings because of the powerful word of God that is attached to the water. Since the Bible teaches that we enjoy salvation only through faith in Christ, and since the Bible teaches that baptism saves us and washes away our sins, we can rightfully say that baptism creates the faith that connects us to Jesus and brings into our lives all the blessings he won by his holy life, sacrificial death and glorious resurrection.\nMatthew 26:26-28, 1 Corinthians 10:16 and 1 Corinthians 11:27 teach clearly that the reception of the Lord\u2019s Supper involves bread and wine, and the Lord\u2019s body and blood.\nMatthew 18:15-20 and John 20:21-23 teach that God has given his Church the right and authority to forgive sins. Individually, we forgive others (Matthew 6:12; Colossians 3:13). When our pastors announce forgiveness in a worship service, they exercise the Keys on behalf of the congregation which has called them to do exactly that.\nWhen it comes to what the Bible teaches about fellowship principles, let me refer you to an appropriate section of This We Believe, a statement of belief of our church body. I\u2019m taking this approach to your last question because the subject of fellowship involves an understanding of the holy Christian church and visible churches. That section of This We Believe will give you appropriate Bible passages and accurate explanations on the subjects.\nGod bless your witnessing efforts!"}

Unfortunately, Saul failed to live up to that designation. The account of Saul\u2019s death paints a dismal picture of his fate: \u201cSaul died because he was unfaithful to the LORD; he did not keep the word of the LORD and even consulted a medium for guidance, and did not inquire of the LORD. So the LORD put him to death and turned the kingdom over to David son of Jesse\u201d (1 Chronicles 10:13-14).\nWhen people die without saving faith in their hearts, they face an eternity in hell. The account of Saul\u2019s death has the language of someone who died in unbelief."}
{"prompt": "Addressing transgender issues", "completion": "What can I say to younger children about transgender issues?  \n\n\nA simple message to children could go along these lines: God\u2019s creation was initially perfect (Genesis 1:31). That included people\u2014the crown of his creation. God created man and woman. God blessed Adam and Eve and gave them the ability to have children: boys and girls. The entrance of sin into the world greatly affected people and the world in which they live. People were no longer perfect, people no longer had a perfect relationship with God and with one another, and people encountered problems in life. One of the problems of sin is that people can become confused about who they are or dissatisfied with who they are. All sin needs to be identified, recognized and confessed. The wonderful message of the Bible is that God does not turn away broken people (Matthew 12:20). Jesus came into the world to save people from their sins (Luke 19:10). When people confess their sins to God, he freely forgives (1 John 1:9).\nIn your conversations on this topic with younger people, keep the focus on sin and grace\u2014and the help for all problems that people can obtain from God. Such conversations also provide opportunities to encourage children to pray for others. God bless your conversations!"}
{"prompt": "Eclipses and the Christian faith", "completion": "Lunar and solar eclipses -  do they have anything to do with the Christian faith, as some Southern Baptists are telling people?\r\n\n\n\nLunar and solar eclipses relate to the Christian faith in as much as God is in control of the heavenly bodies he created (Job 38:31-33; Psalm 104:19-20; Isaiah 45:12; Jeremiah 31:35). The darkening of the sun of which the Bible speaks (Matthew 24:29) is an event that will take place on Judgment Day.\nIf people are interested in identifying current events as signs that point to the last day, then they can speak about tensions among nations (\u201cwars and rumors of wars\u201d) and \u201cfamines and earthquakes\u201d (Matthew 24:6-8). Each occurrence of those events tells us that the last day is right on schedule\u2014God\u2019s schedule. Possessing Christian faith and confidence, God\u2019s people look ahead to that day and say, \u201cAmen. Come, Lord Jesus\u201d (Revelation 22:20)."}

There is immediate judgment (Hebrews 9:27). On the last day God will reunite body and soul (John 5:28-29), and people will experience an eternity in the presence of God or apart from him in hell based on the presence or absence of Christian faith in their hearts.\nAll this is reason why the message of the Bible is that people tend to the needs of their soul now (2 Corinthians 6:1-2; Hebrews 4:7)."}
{"prompt": "Private revelations", "completion": "Does the Lutheran Church have a position on \"private revelations?\"  I am thinking of Lourdes, Fatima, etc., in Roman Catholicism.  As I understand from researching various websites, even when the Roman Catholic Church \"approves\" an occurrence, it only means it (the revelation or event) contains nothing contrary to the faith.  But no one is required to believe the particulars of the occurrence.  Does the Lutheran Church hold out the possibility of any private revelations or have any process for investigating?\n\n\nThe Lutheran Confessions address the subject of divine revelations apart from the Word. Here are a couple of examples: \u201cFor the Church has the command to appoint ministers, which should be most pleasing to us, because we know that God approves this ministry, and is present in the ministry [that God will preach and work through men and those who have been chosen by men]. And it is of advantage, so far as can be done, to adorn the ministry of the Word with every kind of praise against fanatical men, who dream that the Holy Ghost is given not through the Word, but because of certain preparations of their own, if they sit unoccupied and silent in obscure places, waiting for illumination, as the Enthusiasts formerly taught, and the Anabaptists now teach.\u201d (Apology of the Augsburg Confession, Article XIII)\nAlso, \u201cAnd in those things which concern the spoken, outward Word, we must firmly hold that God grants His Spirit or grace to no one, except through or with the preceding outward Word, in order that we may [thus] be protected against the enthusiasts, i.e., spirits who boast that they have the Spirit without and before the Word, and accordingly judge Scripture or the spoken Word, and explain and stretch it at their pleasure, as Muenzer did, and many still do at the present day, who wish to be acute judges between the Spirit and the letter, and yet know not what they say or declare.\u201d (The Smalcald Articles, Part III, Article VIII)\nThe quotations above are in the context of speaking against people who minimized the important work of the Holy Spirit through the Word of God.\nThis We Believe, a statement of belief of our church body, states: \u201cWe believe that the Bible is fully sufficient, clearly teaching people all they need to know to get to heaven. It makes them \u2018wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus\u2019 (2 Timothy 3:15), and it equips them for \u2018every good work\u2019 (2 Timothy 3:17). Since God\u2019s plan of salvation has been fully revealed in the canonical books of the Bible, we need and expect no other revelations (Hebrews 1:1,2). The church is built on the teachings of the apostles and prophets (Ephesians 2:20).\u201d\nThe key phrase is \u201cwe need and expect no other revelations.\u201d While God can certainly do anything, the Word he has given us is entirely sufficient."}
{"prompt": "Relationship with God", "completion": "My question is more of a concern, I guess. In the last six years or so a lot of things have happened in my marriage as well as losing a parent I helped care for.  I have fallen away from church.  I used to feel a draw to God, but lately I don't feel a whole lot. My husband is handicapped and real negative about things.  \r\nMy Mom and the rest of my family fell apart when Dad died. It was like he was the glue that kept everything together. \r\nMy question is:  I am scared that maybe God has given up on me because of the negative path I have been following. I get angry so easily and just don't want to do much anymore. I am seeing a doctor for depression. But I am more concerned with my relationship with God.\r\nI want to make him happy and live my life for him, but life just seems to keep getting in the way of that. Help me if you can.\r\n\r\nThanks.\n\n\nYou are definitely facing some challenges, and I am glad to read that you are seeking and receiving medical care. I am also happy to see that you recognize what is most important in life: your relationship with God.\nWhen it comes to your thoughts of wanting to make God happy, I can understand that. The apostle Paul wrote: \u201cSo we make it our goal to please him [God]\u201d (2 Corinthians 5:9). As redeemed children of God, we strive to live lives that reflect our gratitude to God for his forgiving love. We try to please him, instead of pleasing our sinful nature or Satan.\nThat being said, let me remind you to keep that goal of pleasing God in perspective. As Christian, God is already pleased with you. As a baptized child of God, the Lord looks at you and says, \u201cYou are my child. You are precious in my sight.\u201d You are important to God because he made you and redeemed you. If you ever doubt that, think of the meaning of your baptism.\nWhen you think of \u201cGod giving up on you,\u201d keep in mind what God says to you in his word: \u201cNever will I leave you; never will I forsake you\u201d (Hebrews 13:5). If you have distanced yourself from God by not worshiping him in church or reading your Bible at home, confess those sins to him. God will not ignore that confession (John 6:37; 1 John 1:9). Through his gospel in word and sacrament he will give you the good news of his love and forgiveness.\nYou would benefit from speaking to one of our pastors. Don\u2019t hesitate contacting them, even with your admission of \u201chaving fallen away from church.\u201d They would be glad to help you reconnect. God bless you and your family."}
{"prompt": "Praying on the go", "completion": "Many times as I am riding my motorcycle through the countryside, I talk to God and thank him for the beauty of his wonderful creation:  the beautiful blue skies, the majestic clouds, the rolling landscapes, the green crops in the fields, and even the wonderful smells in the fresh air of the countryside.  These are little things that are often overlooked when traveling by four wheels, and I thank God for them as I am riding on my motorcycle.  Is it okay to talk/pray to God in this manner or should our prayers and conversations with God be more formal with our heads bowed, eyes closed and our hands folded?  Thank you.\n\n\nWhile the Bible describes different prayer postures (bowing \u2013 Exodus 34:8; kneeling \u2013 1 Kings 8:54; standing \u2013 Mark 11:25; lifting up hands \u2013 1 Kings 8:54), it does not command us to follow a certain posture. And in the scenario you describe, that is a good thing!\nIt might be helpful to be reminded what prayer is: it is conversation with God. Prayer can include \u201cpetitions\u2026intercession and thanksgiving\u201d (1 Timothy 2:1). Conversations with God are not limited to certain times of the day, designated places or restricted topics. Think of prayer as a running conversation with God throughout the day and night. As you see the beauties of creation, for example, you tell him how kind and good he is to care for the world he created. As you see someone in need, for example, you ask him to care for that person\u2014through your efforts and the efforts of others. If we see prayer as a running conversation with God throughout the day, we will move beyond any thinking that prayer is limited to times and circumstances, and regulated by postures.\nSo, keep enjoying the beauties of God\u2019s creation on your rides. Keep telling God how much you appreciate how he fills your world with beauty. And be safe!"}
{"prompt": "Calls, congregations and communication", "completion": "What are the guidelines for calling a pastor?  I am especially wondering about communication between members of the church that called your pastor and your pastor that holds their call.  It seems as if guidelines have changed.  How much can a pastor do to investigate conditions in the congregation calling him, and why are congregations who are calling a pastor directed to call/speak with the pastor holding the call and encouraging him to accept the call to their congregation? When did this all start?\n\n\nI cannot point you to any specific guidelines that govern communication between a calling body and the person called. What drives that communication\u2014and the amount of communication\u2014is personal preference and circumstances.\nWhen a pastor receives a call to serve another congregation, he is interested in receiving information about the congregation and community. The cover letter that accompanies the call document puts some of that information in print. Conversations with the calling congregation\u2019s president and other lay leaders\u2014and the laity in general\u2014help round out that information. The pastor called to serve the new congregation desires information so that he has a good picture of both calls he is holding and that he can prayerfully determine where he can best use his gifts to serve the Lord and his people at that particular time in his life.\nDistrict presidents report that sometimes the pastor who has received a call from a second congregation expresses the desire to receive information from that congregation\u2019s members. In that case, members are invited to communicate with the newly-called pastor. On other occasions, district presidents on their own initiative encourage congregation members to communicate with the person they have called to serve as their pastor. Any communication, again, is intended to help the newly-called pastor answer the question: \u201cHow and where can I best serve the Lord at this time in life?\u201d\nWhile communication between people in the calling process is important and can be helpful, there is another form of communication in the calling process that is even more important. That is prayer. When a pastor receives a call to serve another congregation, the members of both congregations want to pray for the pastor, not with \u201caccepting\u201d or \u201cdeclining\u201d the call in mind, but asking God to enable the pastor to see clearly where he can best serve at this point in his life and then to be at peace with the decision.\nThere has always been some communication between a congregation and the newly-called pastor. Perhaps in our day of instant and greater communication we are much more aware of that kind of communication.\nScripture directs us to respect and honor God\u2019s representatives in the church (1 Thessalonians 5:12-13; Hebrews 13:17). We can do that by our communication\u2014to pastors and to God."}

{"prompt": "Bible interpretations and translations", "completion": "I believe the Bible is the word of God. I also believe man is inherently sinful. The words written in the Bible were written by sinful humans. The Bible was originally written in a now \"dead\" language. Taking this into account, I have noted some discrepancies in biblical accounts between different modern interpretations of the Bible.  Even the tone of adjectives and adverbs alters the significance of Scripture. How do can I reconcile that the interpretations of the Bible, whether the original interpretation or modern interpretations, do not contain sinful self-serving human bias? \n\n\nI would encourage you to keep \u201cverbal inspiration\u201d of the Bible in mind. Yes, \u201csinful humans\u201d wrote the books of the Bible, but the Bible itself teaches us that the Holy Spirit is the ultimate author. \u201cAbove all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet\u2019s own interpretation of things. For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit\u201d (2 Peter 1:20-21). \u201cWhat we have received is not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may understand what God has freely given us. This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual realities with Spirit-taught words\u201d (1 Corinthians 2:12-13). While using people to write his word, the Holy Spirit guided their work so that their writing was exactly what he wanted them to write.\n\u201cAll Scripture is God-breathed\u2026\u201d (2 Timothy 3:16). Jesus said: \u201cYour word is truth\u201d (John 17:17). All of Scripture is true because all of it is inspired.\nEven though those Spirit-guided men wrote years ago, the languages they used are not \u201cdead.\u201d Many people today use modern variations of Hebrew and Greek as their native language. Much like the English language has changed over the years, so the biblical languages have undergone changes as well.\nThe words and languages of Scripture are not dead in another sense as well. The Bible says about itself: \u201cFor the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart\u201d (Hebrews 4:12).\nWhen it comes to translations of the Bible, human bias can certainly enter the picture. People might translate with their faulty presuppositions in mind. That is why it is important to use reliable Bible translations and commentaries.

Is this to be reported to anyone?\n\n\nWhen pastors provide Christian counseling, they explain to counselees that they will maintain confidentiality with the exception of any talk of harming self or others. Any mention of suicide is to be taken seriously. Pastors will contact the proper authorities when they believe a counselee is in danger of bringing harm to self. Pastors will also determine if the state in which they live mandates the reporting of individuals who speak of self-harm.\nIf someone came to me multiple times and stated they were going to take their life, I would try to help the person by contacting the proper authorities. The person needs help."}
{"prompt": "Genesis 10 and 11", "completion": "Genesis 10:32 states: \"From these the nations spread out over the earth after the flood.\"  I initially thought those words meant that it all sort of just happened in a somewhat orderly manner right away.  However, immediately following is the account of the Tower of Babel.  Then I wondered if this section further explains the exact details of how 10:32 unfolded.  The general followed by the specific.  Am I correct in my assumption?  Generally, I see things in an orderly fashion; i.e., \"first this happened, then this happened, then this... \"  Listed in the order they happened.  Scripture isn't necessarily arranged that way, and I wondered if this is one of those occasions where a section of Scripture explains a previous section in a more detailed manner.  Thank you.\n\n\nThe book of Genesis consists of ten \u201caccounts.\u201d The fourth account is the \u201csons of Noah,\u201d Genesis 10:1-11:9. We find in this fourth account \u201cThe Table of Nations\u201d and \u201cThe Tower of Babel.\u201d The fourth account describes the movement of Noah\u2019s descendants and the formation of nations.\nWhat will be helpful to keep in mind is that the book of Genesis does not always present information in chronological order. What that means with your particular question is that chapter ten contains some information about nations that would follow the Tower of Babel incident in time.\nWhat I would not do is read Genesis 10:32 and Genesis 1:1 as being in chronological order. The comments you provided with your question seem to acknowledge that."}
{"prompt": "Questions about Eden", "completion": "Why do we have we sin in us because of Adam and Eve's action?\r\nWhy did God put the tree of knowledge of good and evil in the Garden of Eden to provide the opportunity for man to fall into sin?\n\n\nThe Bible speaks of imputed guilt (Romans 5:12-19). You and I were not personally present in the Garden of Eden when Adam and Eve disobeyed God\u2019s command, but God has charged you and me and all people as being guilty of sin. In addition, Adam and Eve have passed down through the generations a sinful nature. With the exception of Jesus Christ, all people are conceived and born in sin (Psalm 51:5).\nPeople sometimes object to one person\u2019s sin in the Garden of Eden adversely affecting others. Romans chapter five also makes it clear that one person\u2019s life of perfect obedience (Jesus Christ) has positively affected others.\nCertainly, God knew that his perfect world would become corrupted by sin. While God could have prevented that from happening, he did not. The Bible does not tell us why. Still, God\u2019s knowledge of future evil does not make him responsible for it.\nThe placement of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil\u2014and the command not to eat from it\u2014provided Adam and Eve with tangible opportunities to show their love and devotion to God. When they disobeyed God\u2019s command, there were grave consequences. Yet, God promised a Savior (Genesis 3:15). Jesus Christ came into the world as true man in fulfillment of that promise to deliver us from sin, death and the power of the devil. Thanks be to God."}
{"prompt": "Translation of Psalm 17:14b", "completion": "Psalm 17:14b  seems to have two distinctly different meanings in the two different NIV translations.  What is the reason and what is the most accurate translation? \n\n\nYour question illustrates the challenges involved in Bible translations. Translating from the original biblical languages into English or any other language is not a matter of \u201cthis word means only that.\u201d Words can have different meanings and shadings. Examining how biblical writers used the same words in different or similar contexts can help shape the meaning.\nIn Psalm 17:14b we are dealing with a rare Hebrew word. So, context will be a determining factor in arriving at a meaning. But what context? In the verses preceding Psalm 17:14, the context is \u201cthe wicked.\u201d The 2011 NIV reflects that. In the verse following Psalm 17:14, the context is \u201cthe righteous.\u201d The 1984 NIV reflects that. Which translation is more accurate? Because context is so important in trying to understand this rare Hebrew word, both translations are accurate. Both translations can stand."}
{"prompt": "Relocation and finding a church", "completion": "I grew up going to the same WELS church for most of my life, but now I have moved to a new area and there isn't really a WELS church close enough. I have tried many different Lutheran churches in my area, trying to find one that felt right, but the one I have liked the best was an ELCA church.  Is it a good idea to go there? Is there a big difference between the two? Or would it be better for me to just listen to WELS sermons online and read daily devotions on my own for now?\n\n\nWhen there is doctrinal unity between churches, the members of those churches can express their fellowship by worshiping together. Doctrinal unity does not exist between WELS and ELCA. The church bodies are not in fellowship with one another. We would not want to pretend that there is doctrinal unity or that fellowship exists by worshiping together.\nThe differences between the two church bodies are many and they are significant. A book like WELS & Other Lutherans spells out the differences in great detail (different views toward the inspiration and inerrancy of Scripture, abortion and homosexuality, ecumenism, roles of men and women, and Communion practices, just to name a few).\nIt sounds like you have inquired about a WELS congregation near you. If you have not tried the WELS Locator, this link will enable you to determine if there are WELS congregations close by. If there are no WELS congregations near your location, do contact the pastor of the WELS congregation to which you belonged. He could use your contact information to see if a WELS pastor might be able to serve you periodically or if there are other WELS individuals in your area. This is how new mission churches can get started.\nBecause it is not advisable to worship with people with whom we are not in fellowship, your personal devotional life becomes much more important at a time like this. You can supplement your devotional activities with resources from this link. God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Benefits in praying", "completion": "I'm attempting to write a devotion about prayer as an introduction to our group's prayer request cards. I'm a little stuck on this notion that I want to include in my devotion: What are the benefits of prayer to the person who is praying? And can you back it all up with Scripture references, please? I've been searching the web and finding discussions about prayer by many denominations, and I want to be sure I have something biblical. Thank you!\n\n\nIf we are going to think about benefits of prayer for the person who is praying, I could suggest the following. It is God\u2019s will that Christians pray for others (1 Timothy 2:1). The new self in Christians desires to follow God\u2019s will (Psalm 40:8). When we do pray for others, we can be reminded that we are doing what God wants.\nAnother benefit for the person praying is seeing prayers answered. God promises to hear and answer our prayers according to his wisdom (1 John 5:14-15). It is encouraging for the person who prays to see an answer to prayer in someone else\u2019s life. That encouragement can lead the person praying to become ever more zealous in approaching God in prayer \u201cwith freedom and confidence\u201d (Ephesians 3:12).\nFinally, a benefit for the person who is praying for others is that the person is becoming more selfless (Philippians 2:4).\nI began this brief response with the word \u201cif.\u201d I did that because I usually don\u2019t think about the benefits I can derive by praying for others. I realize there can be pure motives in finding joy and satisfaction in doing God\u2019s will, but consciously focusing on the benefits I can derive by praying for others, or helping them in other ways, can easily lead me to have the wrong motive for such actions. When it comes to an opportunity to do what God says, I find it easier to take the \u201cNike approach\u201d and just do it.\nI hope I was able to give you some help for your devotion. God\u2019s blessings to you and your group."}

{"prompt": "Christian/Jewish relationship", "completion": "I recently started dating a Jewish man. I grew up Lutheran and attend church often.  If my relationship with this man continues, what options do we have to grow together in faith?  If we were to marry and have children, is it possible to honor both religions?  I have briefly discussed this with my family, and they are most concerned that he will not go to heaven.  Is that entirely true?\n\n\nIf you are a Christian and the man you are dating is Jewish, there is no common bond of faith between the two of you. One of you acknowledges that Jesus is the Christ, the promised Messiah; the other\u2014unless there is something I am unaware of regarding the man\u2019s personal faith\u2014belongs to a religion that does not acknowledge Jesus Christ as the promised Messiah. It is not possible to \u201cgrow together in faith\u201d when there is no common, true faith.\nChildren raised by Christian and Jewish parents can learn customs and practices of each faith, but they will receive conflicting and confusing biblical information.\nWhen it comes to enjoying forgiveness now and life hereafter in heaven, faith in Jesus Christ is essential. The Bible states this about Jesus: \u201cSalvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved\u201d (Acts 4:12). Jesus himself said, \u201cI am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me\u201d (John 14:6). People who reject Jesus Christ as Savior will not enjoy life with God in heaven (Mark 16:16).\nWhen I conducted premarital counseling in the parishes I served, I explained to couples who enjoyed a common faith that they had a solid spiritual foundation for their future marriage. When I counseled couples who did not have a common faith, I laid out the challenges they could expect to encounter: very likely having a solitary worship and devotional life, determining how children\u2014God willing\u2014will be raised, coming to agreement on how part of a family budget will be used in support of the spouses\u2019 places of worship\u2014just to name a few. I imagine these are some of the things you are thinking about presently.\nI would encourage you to speak to one of our pastors about the questions you have asked. A face-to-face conversation would provide you with more complete information. God bless you."}
{"prompt": "God's chosen people?", "completion": "Are the Jews still God's chosen people?\n\n\nThe Jews forfeited that designation when they rejected the promised Messiah: Jesus Christ. God chose Israel as the people through whom he would bring Jesus into the world as true man. God wanted Israel and all people to believe in the Savior he promised and sent. That still is God\u2019s desire today (1 Timothy 2:4; 2 Peter 3:9).\nThe \u201cIsrael of God\u201d of which the New Testament speaks (for example, Galatians 6:16) does not refer to the physical descendants of the patriarchs but those people of various ancestries who trust in Jesus Christ as their Savior. Romans 9-11 also speaks to this point."}
{"prompt": "Faith and love", "completion": "1 John 4:7b states:  \"Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God.\"  I believe that Scripture is the perfect, inerrant Word of God and so I want to know how to understand these words when I know an atheist who shows a lot of love to people but does not know God.\n\n\nContext provides the answer to your question. In 1 John 4 the subject is Christian love: Christians showing love to one another. In the verse you cited, the apostle John explains that Christian love is the outward evidence of Christian faith. When God the Holy Spirit changes hearts through conversion and gives people spiritual life, there is evidence of that in Christians\u2019 lives of love. Jesus\u2019 parable of the sheep and the goats (Matthew 25:31-46) illustrates that truth. The book of James also treats that subject extensively.\nOutward acts of love are not necessarily evidence of Christian faith. Unbelievers may do nice, loving things in life, but those nice things are not proof of saving faith. People who are separated from Jesus Christ because of unbelief are not able to do loving things that are pleasing to God (John 15:5; Hebrews 11:6).\nYour question demonstrates one of the great differences between God and people: \u201cThe Lord does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart\u201d (1 Samuel 16:7).\nI commend you for your attitude of wanting to understand how the \u201cperfect, inerrant Word of God\u201d applies to a situation in your life."}
{"prompt": "Treating all people with love", "completion": "In today's political climate the hate groups such as the Neo-Nazis and White Supremacists seem emboldened to publicly spew their hate. And the most concerning of it all to me is that they try to hide behind being Christians and that their way is ordained by the Bible and Jesus. So, can you please help me with Scripture to point out that they are not being Christians by what they believe? When I think of Jesus' example, he associated with people of all nationalities and sent his disciples out to all nations. I am just having a hard time putting my finger on some Bible verses to bring this message of treating all people with love regardless of their heritage.\n\n\nThe apostle Peter\u2019s words in the home of Cornelius provide practical guidance to what you are asking. After receiving instruction from God that the Old Testament ceremonial laws were no longer in effect, Peter said, \u201cI now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism but accepts from every nation the one who fears him and does what is right\u201d (Acts 10:34-35).\nGod does not show favoritism toward people (Romans 2:11), and he instructs his followers to be imitators of his boundless love. Here are some passages that reflect that. \u201cTherefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers\u201d (Galatians 6:10). \u201cI charge you, in the sight of God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, to keep these instructions without partiality, and to do nothing out of favoritism\u201d (1 Timothy 5:21). \u201cLove your neighbor as yourself\u201d (Mark 12:31). Jesus\u2019 parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37) makes clear that our neighbor is our fellow human being.\nFinally, I would direct you to one of the magnificent scenes the apostle John witnessed in one of his visions from God. He saw the church of God of all time in the presence of God. He described it this way: \u201cAfter this I looked, and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb\u201d (Revelation 7:9). Christians want to recognize the diversity of the Holy Christian Church, the communion of saints. If God has shown love to all people of the world in Jesus his Son (John 3:16), we have so many reasons to do the same."}
{"prompt": "Campus ministry worship", "completion": "Since you have a campus ministry, we were expecting that you would be catering to college kids.   However, our granddaughter came home this weekend and said that she attended your service last weekend and found the songs depressing and sad.  It left her with a bitter taste in her mouth.  She told us that she will now be attending the Free Church.   What's equally sad is that she has two friends from our area whom I'm sure she'll persuade to go to the Free Church with her.  What exactly are you doing to leave this kind of impression?\n\n\nAs WELS pastors coordinate campus ministries in hundreds of locations throughout our country, I do not have knowledge which campus ministry you are referencing. Regardless, you and your granddaughter want to forward any concerns you might have to the pastor who is responsible for that campus ministry.\nWhat I can do is encourage you and your granddaughter to keep music in proper perspective. So, I would ask: is it wise to attend a church that might have more upbeat music but that denies the Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper, turning them into \u201cordinances\u201d? Is it wise to attend a church that teaches millennialism because its music is deemed more cheerful? Those are two of the doctrines of the Evangelical Free Church that are not biblical. It is a sad situation if your granddaughter trades biblical doctrine for music that meets her preference.\nAgain, I would encourage you and your granddaughter to keep in mind what is most important when it comes to our worship of God, and to speak to the pastor where your granddaughter worshipped. God\u2019s blessings to you both."}
{"prompt": "Divorce and dating", "completion": "After marital and Christian counseling, I have decided to file for divorce from my husband due to marital unfaithfulness and forms of abandonment. My question is, as I look forward, is it ever OK to date again? At what point would that be acceptable?\n\n\nIf your marriage ends because of your husband\u2019s unfaithfulness and desertion, you would certainly be in a position to date again. There is no set time that would need to transpire between your divorce and dating again.\nI can say this: dating quickly after the divorce might raise questions in the minds of others, but then what is \u201cquickly\u201d? That definition is going to vary from one person to another. Your pastor could offer you good counsel on this matter. God\u2019s blessings to you."}
{"prompt": "God's unlimited power", "completion": "Can God create a rock so heavy that he can't lift it?  I have heard this question several times before, and it seems self-contradictory, because since God is all-powerful he should be able to both make the rock and lift it.\n\n\nYou are correct in noting that this question is self-contradictory and illogical. Atheists have long asked this question to try to force Christians to concede that there is something incomplete about either God\u2019s creative power or his providential power.\nGod\u2019s power cannot be limited by self-contradictory and illogical questions. The Bible explains that God\u2019s power is unlimited. When God appeared to Abram, he identified himself this way: \u201cI am God Almighty\u201d (Genesis 17:1). The psalm writer explained: \u201cThe Lord does whatever pleases him, in the heavens and on the earth, in the seas and all their depths\u201d (Psalm 135:6).\nGod\u2019s unlimited power is just one of many attributes that separates God from people. In the context of salvation, Jesus said, \u201cWhat is impossible with man is possible with God\u201d (Luke 18:27). Thank God that he has unlimited power and boundless love (John 3:16)."}
{"prompt": "Messianic Judaism", "completion": "Could you please explain some of the core differences and similarities between Christianity and Messianic Judaism? We accept Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior. They appear to have parallel beliefs to us departing from traditional Jewish beliefs.\r\nI'm not including Jewish people that are members of the WELS and other denominations since it's the Lord's will that all people be saved through faith in Christ regardless of ancestry.\n\n\nBecause Messianic Judaism is a movement rather than a church body, the identification of its beliefs may not be true from one adherent to another. In general, the similarity would be a common recognition and confession of Jesus Christ as the promised Messiah. In general, Messianic Judaism would differ from our beliefs and practices in that it retains some of the Old Testament practices, and denies Baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper as means of grace."}

{"prompt": "Guidance for relationship", "completion": "My best friend's sister recently ended a long-term relationship and, against our better judgement, we started dating. After realizing that we had rushed into things (based upon a mixture of how fast the relationship seemed to move and my fear that she was transferring lingering feelings and expectations for her ex onto me), we agreed to \"take a break\" and try again later. During these few weeks I have begun to feel that despite our past friendship and mutual interests, we aren't compatible. The problem I'm having is that she very invested in making our relationship work, I don't want to hurt her, and I told her we would try again. She doesn't have any real friends aside from me and her family doesn't support her in anything she does (except for the relationship with me). I understand that doing the right thing will be painful and I have been praying for answers and the strength to act.  Do you have some Scripture to help me or some words of wisdom? Thank you.\n\n\nIf you told your friend that \u201cwe would try again\u201d and you do not intend to follow through on that, you want to confess your shortcomings and seek her forgiveness. Your friend deserves an honest explanation.\nAre there Scripture passages applicable to your situation? These passages come to mind: \u201cBe kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you\u201d (Ephesians 4:32). \u201cTherefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbor, for we are all members of one body\u201d (Ephesians 4:25). \u201cDo not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God\u201d (Philippians 4:6). \u201cLet your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone\u201d (Colossians 4:6).\nI hope these passages are helpful.

{"prompt": "Favorite hymn", "completion": "What is the WELS members' favorite hymn?\n\n\nI cannot point you to a single, specific answer.

{"prompt": "Concerned about a friend", "completion": "How can I truthfully and lovingly respond to a friend from church who is captivated by the messages of Sarah Young found in the best-selling devotional \"Jesus Calling\" and its \"sequels\" and is promoting the words and methods that Sarah invites us to use to experience the intense pleasure of the presence of God?\n\n\nI would suggest first asking your friend some questions to understand her interest in the books you cited. The answers she provides will give you direction for your own responses.\nI would also suggest reminding your friend how God communicates to us. While God can do anything and communicate to people in any way he chooses, he explains that he has spoken and revealed his will through inspired writers and his one and only Son (Hebrews 1:1-2). Because Jesus is the final and most complete revelation of the Father\u2019s will, we do not look for revelations and communications from God apart from his word.\nThe Lord explains that his word is all-sufficient for salvation (Luke 16:29). It is through the word of God that the Holy Spirit works in people\u2019s hearts (John 6:63; Romans 10:17). It is God\u2019s word that provides direction for life (Psalm 119:105). Christians recognize that it is their Lord who speaks to them through his word (John 10:27-28). A section of Scripture like Psalm 119 teaches us that it is through the word of God\u2014and not by mystical experiences\u2014that God speaks to us.\nIf, by \u201cpromoting the words and methods\u201d of the books you cited, your friend is a disruptive force in the congregation, you may eventually need to have a conversation with your pastor.\nGod bless your conversations with your friend."}
{"prompt": "Creation account in Genesis 1 and 2", "completion": "This is about the question prompted by Genesis 1 & 2. What is WELS' explanation of the narrative of creation in regard to the order of creating animals and man? Genesis 1 explains animals were created first. Genesis 2 prompts man first (in verse 7) and again in verse 18. \r\n\r\nIs this an intentional typo? I feel God wants us to focus on life, he wants us to love life. And the pursuit of knowledge (i.e. creation) is something that can cause more harm than good.  I would reach out to my own pastor but I feel embarrassed to cause chaos so directly and out of the blue.\n\n\nWhat will be helpful is keeping in mind that Moses presents the six-day creation account in Genesis 1. In the following chapter, in Genesis 2, Moses goes into more detail of the creation of Adam\u2014and then Eve. It is clear from the inspired record that God created animals before he created man.\nThe closest thing I can come to with a \u201cWELS explanation\u201d is what we state in This We Believe, a statement of belief of our church body:\n\u201c1. We believe that the universe, the world, and the human race came into existence in the beginning when God created heaven and earth and all creatures (Genesis 1,2). Further testimony to this event is found in other passages of the Old and New Testaments (for example, Exodus 20:11; Hebrews 11:3). The creation happened in the course of six consecutive days of normal length by the power of God\u2019s almighty word.\n\u201c2.

{"prompt": "Satan and his power", "completion": "The Bible tells us that Jesus has crushed Satan's head (Gen. 3:15, John 19:28).  Unless I'm misunderstanding something (in which case, please correct me), that means that the devil is now powerless.  If that is so, then why do we consider him to be one of the three main forms of temptation (along with our sinful flesh and this world; see 1 Cor. 7:5 for one place Paul says that we can be tempted by the devil)?\n\n\nYour question takes us back to the Garden of Eden. After sin shattered the perfection of Eden, God promised a Savior (Genesis 3:15). We will need to recognize the setting and the language to understand that Satan is still a powerful tempter today.\nGod spoke the words of Genesis 3:15 to Satan, but he spoke them for the benefit of Adam and Eve and all their descendants. God announced that there would be animosity between his children and those on the side of Satan\u2014whether they are fallen angels or people.\nGod then revealed that one of Adam and Eve\u2019s offspring, the promised Messiah, would crush Satan\u2019s head. Keep in mind that Satan is a spirit being, having no body of flesh and bones. In Eden, he assumed the form of a serpent. With no physical head to be crushed, God\u2019s promise spoke of a crushing blow to the power of Satan.\nJesus delivered such a blow when he rose triumphantly from the dead and then descended into hell to prove to Satan who had won the battle (1 Peter 3:18-20).\nWhat we can say from Scripture is that Satan is a defeated enemy of God at this point. He still has the ability to tempt people today, and he seeks to do just that (1 Peter 5:8-9). God, in his wisdom, before the end of time will allow Satan to have more freedom to do his evil work (Revelation 20:3). But finally, on Judgment Day, Satan\u2019s power will be crushed completely and he will not be able to tempt people anymore (Revelation 20:10).\nIn summary, God promised that a Savior would crush the devil \u201cin respect to his head\u201d (a literal translation). Jesus came into the world to \u201cdestroy the devil\u2019s work\u201d (1 John 3:8). Jesus dealt Satan a crushing blow when he resisted his temptations, died for the sins of the world and then rose to life victoriously.

The Bible makes statements like these: \u201cThe blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin\u201d (1 John 1:7). \u201cSince we have now been justified by his [Christ\u2019s] blood, how much more shall we be saved from God\u2019s wrath through him!\u201d (Romans 5:9) \u201cIn him [Jesus Christ] we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins\u201d (Ephesians 1:7). \u201cBut now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ\u201d (Ephesians 2:13).\nPraying for \u201cthe blood of Jesus to protect our home, family, etc.\u201d calls to mind the blood of the Passover lamb that was applied to the doorframes of the Israelites\u2019 dwellings prior to the tenth plague (Exodus 12:7). Because the lamb pointed ahead to Jesus and his sacrificial work, it comes as no surprise that the New Testament identifies Jesus as \u201cour Passover lamb\u201d (1 Corinthians 5:7).\n\u201cAre there problems with praying for the blood of Jesus to protect our home, family, etc.?\u201d you wonder. A \u201cproblem\u201d I could foresee, since we do not typically use that terminology, would be confusion in the minds of others with whom you shared the contents of your prayer life. Those people might wonder what you mean by that expression. Their questions would give you an opportunity to explain what you mean.\nAnother issue is that someone might wrongly identify you with part of the Christian world today that is known for \u201cpleading the blood of Jesus\u201d in their prayers. Some of those people put a great deal of emphasis on the person praying in order for the prayer \u201cto work.\u201d There is even a detailed plan and a web site to explain how to \u201cplead the blood of Jesus.\u201d A Christian known to be using the prayer language of others can wrongly be identified with them and their theology.\nBeyond those \u201cproblems\u201d of misunderstanding, we certainly enjoy a great deal of freedom in formulating our prayers to God for his protection and guidance. The \u201cblood of Jesus\u201d fits into that freedom."}

{"prompt": "Heavenly prayer?", "completion": "Based on Zechariah 1:12-13, is it correct to say that \"angels pray for us (i.e., for Christians)\"?\r\nThank you!\n\n\nWe know from the Bible that angels do praise and worship God (Isaiah 6:2-3; Luke 2:13-14; Revelation 5:11-14). Angels rejoice when the Holy Spirit leads sinners to repentance (Luke 15:10).\nThere are no biblical references to created angels offering petitions to God. The angel in Zechariah 1:12 is the angel of the Lord, the second person of the Trinity, Jesus Christ before his incarnation. That Scripture verse gives us a glimpse into a conversation within the Godhead. The angel of Zechariah 1:13 is the angel referenced four verses earlier.\nZechariah chapter one does not teach that angels pray for Christians. Other parts of Scripture speak of something far greater than that\u2014the fact that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, intercedes on behalf of his followers. In John 17:20-26 Jesus prayed for his followers of all time. Romans 8:34 tells us that Jesus intercedes for us. Hebrews 7:25 speaks of that intercession. 1 John 2:1 does the same. How humbling and comforting it is to know that you and I are part of the Lord\u2019s conversations with his Father."}
{"prompt": "Origin of souls", "completion": "Is a person's soul created at conception, or was it created during the six days of creation? \n\n\nThe Bible does not teach that our souls come into existence prior to our conception.\nThe question people have raised over the years is whether God directly creates each soul at conception or if the soul is propagated along with the body at conception, coming from our parents. Most Lutheran theologians favor the latter view because the Bible does speak of spiritual conditions\u2014and that concerns the soul\u2014being passed on from one generation to the next (Genesis 5:3; Psalm 51:5). That view also places the responsibility for sin where it belongs: on people and not God (Psalm 51:4-6; Romans 5:12; James 1:13-14)."}
{"prompt": "Coping with loss", "completion": "How do I cope after losing my spouse?\n\n\nFirst, please allow me to extend my sympathy to you upon the death of your spouse. The risen and ascended Lord has comfort and strength for you through his precious gospel. I encourage you to give your Savior many opportunities to bring you comfort and strength through hearing and reading the precious word of God and by receiving the Lord\u2019s Supper.\nMy next encouragement is for you to speak to your pastor. He is in a position to listen to your concerns and address them. He may have resources, such as grief support groups, that he could recommend to you. Or he might suggest distance grief counseling through Christian Family Solutions.\nResources I could recommend, beyond Scripture, are books from Northwestern Publishing House. This link will take you to the appropriate part of their web site.\nFinally, I would encourage you to allow friends, family and church members to reach out to you. In times of loss, people can easily withdraw from the love and support of others. If people offer help and assistance, do accept their offers. At times like this, people genuinely want to help.\nAbove all, cling to the words and promises of your God. He assures you: \u201cNever will I leave you; never will I forsake you\u201d (Hebrews 13:5). God promises you: \u201c\u2019Though the mountains be shaken and the hills be removed, yet my unfailing love for you will not be shaken nor my covenant of peace be removed,\u2019 says the LORD, who has compassion on you\u201d (Isaiah 54:10). God be with you!"}
{"prompt": "WELS and EFCA", "completion": "What are the main differences between WELS and EFCA, the Evangelical Free Church of America? I read through part of their web site and it seems very similar. \n\n\nThe Statement of Faith of the Evangelical Free Church of America (EFCA) departs from biblical teaching in the areas of the sacraments and Jesus\u2019 visible return on the last day. In referencing Baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper, the Statement of Faith identifies them as \u201cordinances,\u201d \u201cwhich visibly and tangibly express the gospel. Though they are not the means of salvation, when celebrated by the church in genuine faith, these ordinances confirm and nourish the believer.\u201d\nBy turning sacraments into \u201cordinances,\u201d the EFCA denies that Baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper are means of grace through which God offers and gives forgiveness of sins, life and salvation. When sacraments become \u201cordinances,\u201d then the focus is on doing and not receiving.\nThe Bible teaches that God offers and gives forgiveness of sins, life and salvation through Baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper (Acts 2:38; Acts 22:16; Matthew 26:28).\nThe Statement of Faith also expresses belief \u201cin the personal, bodily and premillennial return of our Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d The Bible does not teach that Jesus will return to this world to rule over a literal 1,000-year period of peace on earth. Jesus explained to Pontius Pilate that his kingdom is not of this world (John 18:36).\nIn a document titled \u201cDistinctives of the Evangelical Free Church of America,\u201d the statement is made: \u201cWe join with other Christians and other denominations of like, precious faith in common goals and ministries to accomplish the Great Commandment and the Great Commission.\u201d That position of ecumenism runs contrary to Romans 16:17, but fits in with the EFCA\u2019s position of \u201cIn essentials, unity. In non-essentials, charity.\u201d\nI am happy to see that the EFCA\u2019s Statement of Faith points people to Jesus Christ as the only Savior from sin, but doctrinal errors\u2014any errors\u2014are serious and potentially destructive of saving faith (Galatians 5:9)."}
{"prompt": "Civil, biblical communication with others", "completion": "There has been much recent focus on race and inequality in our society. One of the popular topics of the day is the concept of \"white privilege.\" There have been numerous high profile allegations of police unjust treatment of African Americans. Currently, Americans are engaged in a battle over the proper etiquette for respecting the flag and our national anthem. How can we talk about these issues with friends and family in a biblical way? \n\n\nYou ask a timely question. Certainly, the issues you mentioned have led to changing tones and rising volume levels in personal conversations and online forums. I can pass along some biblical principles that can guide Christians in their conversations with others.\nRecognize that God\u2019s love is boundless. The apostle Peter eventually came to realize that God does not show favoritism (Acts 10:34).\nBecause God\u2019s love is boundless, the makeup of his church is diverse. Another apostle, John, understood that clearly from one of the visions God granted him (Revelation 7:9-10).\nThe God of boundless love instructs us to love our neighbor as ourselves (Mark 12:28-31). Jesus made it clear that our neighbor is our fellow human being (Luke 10:25-37).\nWe show love to others by giving them proper respect (1 Peter 2:17). We show love to others when we live life unselfishly, putting the interests of others before our own (Philippians 2:3-4).\nIf we have sinned against others by unkind words and actions, we confess our sins to them and God (James 5:16; Jeremiah 3:13).\nIf others have sinned against us and confessed their sins to us, we are obligated to forgive them (Matthew 18:21-35).\nRegarding the national anthem protests, this link will direct you to a \u201cLight for our path\u201d column that recently addressed this issue.\nMay God lead us all to treat others and communicate with them in love and respect."}
{"prompt": "Jesus and Melchizedek", "completion": "What does it mean in the Bible when it says, \"You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek\"?  Thank you.\n\n\nThe words you cited first occur in Psalm 110:4. The writer to the Hebrews then quotes that verse in Hebrews 5:6 and 7:17.\nMelchizedek is someone we meet in Genesis 14:18-20. There he is described as both \u201cking of Salem\u201d and \u201cpriest of God Most High.\u201d The combination of king and priest in one person is unique and points ahead in time to Jesus Christ, who is our Prophet, Priest and King.\nIn his letter to the Hebrews, the inspired writer explains how Jesus is far superior to anyone and anything\u2014including Melchizedek. The origins of Melchizedek are mysterious (Hebrews 7:3). That points to Jesus Christ who, as true man, was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary, yet as the eternal Son of God his \u201corigins are from of old, from ancient times\u201d (Micah 5:2). The priesthood of Melchizedek surpassed the Levitical priesthood (Hebrews 7). That points ahead to Jesus Christ, who has a \u201cpermanent priesthood\u201d (Hebrew 7:24). Jesus\u2019 sacrifice was \u201conce for all\u201d (Hebrews 7:27).\nIn short, the phrase you cited is a prophecy (Psalm 110:4) and fulfillment (Hebrews 5:6; 7:17) of Jesus\u2019 service as our great high priest in sacrificing himself for our sins (Hebrews 7:27) and interceding for us when we sin (Hebrews 7:25)."}
{"prompt": "Regeneration", "completion": "Other than baptism, is there another means of regeneration?  What exactly is meant by regeneration?  If after the fall into sin man is incapable of accepting the Law or understanding what the Word of God proclaims because he in fact hates God, how can he ever accept God's grace?  It is my understanding that we do not in fact accept God's grace, but it is a gift given to us that is ours only to reject. So then, how can we be willing to be baptized if we by our natural state reject God and what he stands for?\n\n\n\u201cRegeneration\u201d describes Christian conversion, brought about by the Holy Spirit, as \u201crebirth.\u201d People are naturally spiritually dead (Ephesians 2:5). When the Holy Spirit changes hearts and gives people saving faith, spiritually dead people become alive spiritually. The Bible describes that change as \u201crebirth\u201d or being \u201cborn again\u201d (John 3:5; Titus 3:5; 1 Peter 1:23).\nThe Holy Spirit brings about rebirth as he works through the word of God alone or the word of God attached to water (Baptism).\nIn regard to your last question, when the Holy Spirit brings an adult to saving faith through the word of God alone, there would be good reason for that person to want to be baptized: to do what Jesus says and to receive an additional guarantee of God\u2019s forgiving love. That desire to be baptized comes from a person whom the Holy Spirit has already brought to faith through the word of God alone.\nIn all of this, we want to keep in mind that Christian faith is a gracious gift of God (Ephesians 2:8). Thanks be to God for this gift."}
{"prompt": "Living with the last day in mind", "completion": "I see the question \"If you knew the Lord was coming tomorrow, what would you do today?\" posted on social media often, especially by non-Lutheran family and friends.   My reply without hesitation is: \"Nothing different, as I am ready.\" How, as a WELS Lutheran, do I answer the inevitable follow-up questions?   Comments always range from \"Pray\" and \"Get Ready\" to \"Spread the Gospel.\"  Shouldn't we already be doing those things?\r\n\r\n\n\n\nI am with you in how I would react to such (hypothetical) news. If we take seriously the Bible\u2019s instructions to live each day of life soberly (1 Peter 4:7), with prayerful watchfulness (Matthew 25:13; Colossians 4:2; 1 Thessalonians 5:4-8) and an urgency to spread the gospel (2 Corinthians 6:2), then such news of the Lord\u2019s Second Advent will not change the focus of our daily living. Rather, there will be good reason to intensify those ongoing activities of prayer, personal preparedness and outreach.\nHere is a little twist to that question: knowing (somehow) that the Lord was coming sometime tomorrow does not guarantee that I will be alive on the earth when that momentous event takes place. My earthly life might end at some point today, before \u201ctomorrow\u201d comes. Recognition of that leads me to live each day of life as God directs in his word. \u201cTeach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom\u201d (Psalm 90:12)."}
{"prompt": "Giving glory to God", "completion": "While the Bible tells us that God acts with multiple purposes and motivations (love, display power, make Himself known), there are passages that support that man's ultimate purpose and God's chief purpose is the glory of God (1 Cor. 10:31, Isaiah 43:7, etc).  Even though this teaching is promoted in Reformed churches, it does seem to have biblical support.  It does seem that the final result of other motivations and purposes is that God is glorified.  I may have missed it, but I don't see this topic of purposes and ultimate purpose addressed in the Lutheran Confessions.  Are there concerns from our WELS perspective with the teaching that God's ultimate purpose is His glory?\n\n\nYour question underscores different emphases in Reformed theology and Lutheran theology. Reformed theology will stress the sovereignty of God and people\u2019s response of obedience to it, while Lutheran theology emphasizes the grace of God in Christ and Christian faith, which enables people to enjoy God\u2019s grace and forgiveness.\nIt is not that Lutheran theology glosses over the subject of Christians praising God. Here are a few examples where the Lutheran Confessions speak of praising God. In his explanation of the Second Article of the Apostles\u2019 Creed in the Small Catechism Martin Luther described what Jesus did to save us from our sins. Then, he explained the purpose of that redemption: \u201cAll this he did that I should be his own, and live under him in his kingdom, and serve him in everlasting righteousness, innocence, and blessedness, just as he has risen from death and lives and rules eternally. This is most certainly true.\u201d\nIn his explanation of the First Article of the Apostles\u2019 Creed in the Large Catechism, Luther wrote: \u201cNow, since all that we possess, and, moreover, whatever, in addition, is in heaven and upon the earth, is daily given, preserved, and kept for us by God, it is readily inferred and concluded that it is our duty to love, praise, and thank Him for it without ceasing, and, in short, to serve Him with all these things, as He demands and has enjoined in the Ten Commandments.\u201d\nFinally, there is this statement at the close of the Apology of the Augsburg Confession: \u201cWe hope that all God-fearing men will sufficiently see from this writing of ours that ours is the Christian doctrine and comforting and salutary to all godly men. Accordingly, we pray God to extend His grace to the end that His holy Gospel may be known and honored by all, for His glory, and for the peace, unity, and salvation of all of us. Regarding all these articles we offer to make further statements, if required.\u201d Certainly, the defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ throughout the Lutheran Confessions gives praise and glory to God.\nSo, while Reformed theology accentuates the creation of human beings for the glory of God, Lutheran theology puts the spotlight on God\u2019s gracious love for sinners. That love certainly demands a response (Psalm 116:12), but the response does not overshadow the love that prompted it."}
{"prompt": "The Alliance churches", "completion": "What are the key differences in beliefs of The Alliance churches and confessional Lutherans?\n\n\nThe statement of faith of The Alliance does point to Jesus Christ as Savior. However, the same statement also reveals these errors: premillennialism and a denial of the sacraments as means of grace. There is also a misunderstanding of James 5:14, which speaks of a medicinal use of oil. Another section of their web site supports decision theology.\nYour question is a good reminder to \u201ctest the spirits\u201d (1 John 4:1)."}
{"prompt": "Mark 16:16 and Baptism", "completion": "My Lutheran upbringing always taught me that we are justified by faith alone.  Mark 16:16 states that he who believes and is baptized shall be saved.  Now would that imply that we are not saved by faith alone, but by faith and baptism?  Shouldn't Lutherans be teaching that instead of faith alone?  Thank you.\n\n\nYour Lutheran upbringing has not misled you. The Bible consistently teaches that we are saved by God\u2019s grace through faith in Jesus Christ without any works of our own (Romans 3:28; Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:5-6).\nJesus\u2019 words in Mark 16:16 show us that Baptism is not a meaningless act. Baptism saves (Titus 3:5-6) because through the Christian faith it creates people enjoy the salvation Jesus won for them.\nYou notice in Mark 16:16 that it is not the lack of Baptism that condemns. It is the lack of faith. Christian faith saves; unbelief condemns. Faith in Jesus Christ is absolutely necessary for salvation. Baptism is not absolutely necessary in the sense that the Holy Spirit can work faith in a person\u2019s heart through the word of God alone\u2014apart from Baptism\u2014and such a person might not have opportunity to be baptized. Baptism is necessary in the sense that Jesus commanded baptism (Matthew 28:18-19) and it is a means of grace (Mark 16:16).\nSo, let\u2019s continue to teach that we are saved by God\u2019s grace through faith in Christ alone. Let\u2019s also continue to teach the blessings and importance of Baptism."}
{"prompt": "Animals and souls", "completion": "Do animals have souls?\n\n\nThere is nothing in the Bible to support the idea that animals have souls. Everything the Bible teaches about being created originally in the image of God, being conceived and born in sin after the fall in Eden, being guilty of committing actual sins, being the objects of God\u2019s redeeming love in Jesus, having body and soul reunited on the last day, and spreading the good news of salvation concerns people not animals.\nAnimals certainly were the result of God\u2019s creative power (Genesis 1), but Adam came to recognize how uniquely different he was from the rest of God\u2019s animate creation. We know that part of that difference is that Adam alone consisted of body and soul."}
{"prompt": "Meaning of Daniel's prophecy", "completion": "What is meant in Daniel and Mark concerning \"the abomination that causes desolation\"?\n\n\nDaniel\u2019s prophecy pointed ahead to troublesome times for God\u2019s people. Conservative Bible scholars and commentators often point to the desecration of the temple in 167 B.C. by the Syrian ruler Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the destruction of the temple in 70 A.D. and the ongoing work of the Antichrist in the New Testament age as fulfillments of that prophecy.\nMark 12 clearly lists signs of the end times.

Jesus left nothing undone when it came to living up to his name, which means \u201cSavior.\u201d\nWhen Jesus rose from the dead, he crushed Satan\u2019s power (Genesis 3:15) and destroyed the power of death (1 Corinthians 15). But death remains, doesn\u2019t it? It remains as a consequence of sin (Romans 6:23).\n1 Corinthians 15:24 speaks of Jesus\u2019 visible return to this world on the last day. On that day the resurrection of the dead will take place (John 5:28-29), eternal separation of Christians and non-Christians will take place (Matthew 25:31-46) and Satan will be put out of commission entirely (Revelation 20:10). Death will no longer affect God\u2019s people (1 Corinthians 15:26).\nYes, Jesus is preparing a place for us (John 14:2-3). It is a place of perfection, beauty and glory (Revelation 21-22).

{"prompt": "Witnessing to niece", "completion": "What is the most effective way to witness to my niece who lives with her boyfriend?\n\n\nSpeak the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15) to your niece. With your words, actions and attitudes let your niece see that you are concerned about her spiritual welfare and her boyfriend.\nYou can remind your niece about the tempting situations her living arrangements present. The Bible urges people to \u201cflee from sexual immorality\u201d (1 Corinthians 6:18). God explains that he \u201cwill judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral\u201d (Hebrews 13:4). God provides this course of action for his followers: \u201cBut among you, there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality\u201d (Ephesians 5:3).\nYou can encourage your niece to think of others. What do her parents think of her living arrangements? While the fourth commandment changes in scope as parents and children grow older, the fourth commandment never disappears. You can lead your niece to think of how her actions might affect other family members, friends and acquaintances. Might her actions cause them to stumble spiritually (Matthew 18:6-7) and perhaps embolden others to follow her example? Love for God certainly drives our desire to live godly lives. Love for others is another strong motivator.\nFinally, with the assumption that your niece is a Christian, you can remind her of the calling Christians have to live different lives from those outside the faith (1 Peter 2:9-12).\nIn your conversations with your niece you want to share God\u2019s law that shows the path to godly living and also exposes ours sins. You also want to share God\u2019s gospel that reveals the forgiving love of God (Psalm 103:8-14). You can encourage your niece with the news that God hears the cries of the penitent and responds with forgiveness (1 John 1:9). Listen to what your niece says and then respond lovingly with the precious truths of God\u2019s word. God bless your loving witness to your niece."}
{"prompt": "The local practice of 1 Corinthians 11", "completion": "Is wearing a head covering in prayer/daily life (based on 1 Corinthians 11) for Lutheran women a personal choice?\n\n\nYes.

{"prompt": "Pastoral oversight and Holy Communion", "completion": "I have been a WELS member for 45 years.  I am divorced but living with a male partner.  I was asked to step down by my pastor from teaching Sunday School 3 years ago.  I recently started regularly going back to my church.  Due to my living arrangements and after 2 meetings with pastor and no intentions on getting married, pastor is asking me to refrain from receiving Holy Communion.  He is not telling me to stop hearing the word of God at church but refrain from this.  Can he tell a church member they cannot take Communion due to their sin?\n\n\nYes, your pastor has that authority and responsibility. Your pastor has the responsibility of watching over the souls entrusted to him (Acts 20:28; 1 Peter 5:2).\nThe Bible explains that people can harm themselves by receiving the Lord\u2019s Supper \u201cin an unworthy manner\u201d (1 Corinthians 11:27-30). When there are wrong attitudes about sin, the sacrament or Jesus, people can receive the Lord\u2019s Supper to their spiritual harm. By telling you to refrain from receiving the sacrament at this time of life because of your circumstances, your pastor is showing appropriate love and concern for you.\nWhile there are biblical restrictions and guidelines on the distribution and reception of the Lord\u2019s Supper, you and all people are welcome to hear the word of God read and proclaimed in church. No doubt, your pastor is hoping and praying that by hearing the word of God you will have a change of heart\u2014and also change your living arrangements\u2014so that you can be a guest at the Lord\u2019s Supper again.\nYour pastor\u2019s actions indicate that he takes seriously his responsibility of spiritual oversight of the souls entrusted to him. Like Ezekiel (Ezekiel 3:17-21), he seeks to warn individuals of sin and point them to the Savior for forgiveness. You really can be thankful for such a pastor."}
{"prompt": "Scripture readings in church", "completion": "Pastor, did WELS adopt the Catholic Old Testament readings after Vatican II or did you formulate your own?  \n\n\nWELS did not adopt the three-year cycle of Scripture readings, including Old Testament readings, as Vatican II designed them. The Inter-Lutheran Commission on Worship, which did not include WELS participation, revised the assigned Scripture readings in the 1970s for use in Lutheran churches.\nIn 2008 WELS did produce a supplemental cycle of Scripture readings in connection with Christian Worship: Supplement. Because of this, different WELS churches might have different Scripture readings on the same Sunday of the church year."}
{"prompt": "Teaching at a university", "completion": "I am a woman who has been pursuing a degree in mathematics at university with the intention of teaching it at a post-secondary level.  It is most likely that I would end up teaching at a co-ed college or university.  If I understand the Bible correctly, it is wrong for a woman to instruct adult males in regard to religious matters.  Does this apply to secular subjects?  Specifically, is it permissible for a Christian woman to instruct adults solely with regard to the subject of mathematics?\n\n\nI can respond to your questions from the perspective of serving on the faculty of Martin Luther College, the WELS college of ministry. An application of the biblical roles of men and women at this college is that \u201cthe teaching of courses in which God\u2019s Word is primary and paramount or in which it is used to judge and/or evaluate the matters being taught is reserved for male professors.\u201d There is the understanding that mathematics is a discipline in which men and women can serve as professors at this college. You can use this information to apply it to your own situation\u2014teaching in a secular setting."}
{"prompt": "Accurate Bible interpretation", "completion": "Hello, sir.  I was talking with my Roman Catholic girlfriend about the doctrine of Sola Scriptura this morning and she said, \"If there are so many ways of looking at the Bible, how do you know which is correct?\" I told her that you just let Scripture interpret Scripture, not our opinions. What would you have told her?\n\n\nYou said it well. An important principle in interpreting the Bible is to let Scripture interpret Scripture. In practical terms, that means that if we are having difficulty understanding a particular section of the Bible, we look to other parts of the Bible that contain the same subject matter to derive meaning of that difficult section.\nIn addition, we take into account matters like genre. God communicated his message to us in the Bible through different kinds of literature: historical narrative, poetry, prophecy-teaching, epistle and apocalyptic. Recognizing the genre will point the way to proper interpretation.\u00a0 It is also important to recognize symbolic and figurative language from literal language.\u00a0 Understanding words in their context is critical to accurate biblical interpretation.\nWhile we need to use our minds to read and interpret Scripture, we do not let human reason change the meaning of Scripture.\nFinally, as Lutheran Christians, we look to Scripture alone as the source and foundation of our faith. This month\u2019s Light for our path column in Forward in Christ addressed that point.\nGod bless your conversations with your girlfriend!"}
{"prompt": "Parental treatment of boys and girls", "completion": "Is it biblical for parents to give more privileges and independence to boys than girls? \n\n\nThere is nothing in the Bible to suggest parental preferential treatment of boys. Distinctions between boys and girls in Old Testament Israel that resulted from Mosaic laws or customs (for example, inheritance laws) are no longer applicable for New Testament Christians. Parents today will seek to treat their children, both boys and girls, with equal love. Above all, that means bringing them to Jesus in baptism and then following up with training and education in the word of God (Ephesians 6:4)."}
{"prompt": "Speaking in tongues", "completion": "I see a lot of videos circling around among friends in chat groups, where Christian missionaries or pastors are talking loudly in tongues and pushing people backwards and telling them they are anointed with the Holy Spirit.  It's so sickening to see people mocking at Christianity. Is this all true, and are those poor people required to fall back and roll on the ground in the name of the Holy Spirit? Is that what our loving and merciful God expects? What's even more intriguing is that I have read in the Bible that talking in tongues is a gift, but I do not know what it sounds like and how it's done.  Appreciate your response. Thank You!\n\n\nActs 2 records the miraculous gift of speaking in known, intelligible languages that the Lord\u2019s followers did not previously know. While God of course can do anything and can give similar gifts today if he so chooses, we have no such promise that he will do that. This We Believe, a statement of belief of our church body, addresses that point. \u201cThe Holy Spirit also equips the church with all the spiritual gifts it needs for its well-being (1 Corinthians 12:4-11). During the beginning of the New Testament era, special charismatic gifts were given to the church, such as signs, miracles, and speaking in tongues. These gifts were connected with the ministry of the apostles (2 Corinthians 12:12). There is no evidence in Scripture that we today should expect the continuation of such charismatic gifts.\u201d\nOn the other hand, there can be the expectation and demand in Pentecostal churches that the Holy Spirit will give people the ability to utter sounds that are not known languages. A good course of action is to compare the teachings of those churches with the Bible. When we recognize that the teachings of churches are not the teachings of the Bible, then we do not believe their message or follow their instructions.\nToday many Christians are being told that speaking in tongues is a sign that they are God\u2019s children. That is unfortunate because the Bible tells us that we are not to expect the same spiritual gift in all Christians (1 Corinthians 12:27-31). More than that, the certainty of our status as God\u2019s children is not dependent on us and what we can do, or claim to do. That certainty comes from God, as he calls us his own because of his work (2 Corinthians 1:21-22; Titus 3:4-7).\nFinally, the apostle Paul made it clear that it is clear communication in the church that benefits speakers and their listeners (1 Corinthians 14:1-25). Communication that is not clear is not beneficial."}
{"prompt": "Reformation history", "completion": "Why is October 31 (or the Sunday before) celebrated as Reformation Day?  I realize that's the day Martin Luther posted the 95 Theses, but there were other writings before and after that.  When did the \"Lutheran\" Church as such come into existence with its own organizational structure separate from the Roman Catholic hierarchy?\n\n\nBecause the 95 Theses were translated, published and spread throughout Germany and other parts of Europe very quickly, and because the theses set in motion a chain of events involving the Roman Catholic Church and Martin Luther, the date of their posting is considered the beginning of the Lutheran Reformation.\nLuther recognized he had no home in the Roman Catholic Church when the church excommunicated him in 1520. Lutheran churches began organizing in Germany as early as 1523. The organizational structure of Lutheran churches in Germany and elsewhere in Europe was not consistent, but Christian freedom allows such variety.\nNorthwestern Publishing House has many resources on the Reformation available. This link will take you to the appropriate section of their web site."}
{"prompt": "Deacons and ministries", "completion": "What do we know about Stephen Ministries?  Should a WELS church leader attend a seminar of theirs? Second question:  Does WELS have deacons?  What exactly are they?\n\n\nOn their web site, Stephen Ministries explains its history and purpose well. There is anecdotal evidence that some WELS congregations are among the 179 different denominations that have received training in this visitation ministry. Because the organization uses training materials to instruct individuals in so many different churches, WELS pastors have seen a need to supplement the materials for a more gospel-centered approach.\nWELS congregations might or might not have deacons. A congregation\u2019s Constitution and Bylaws will detail any information on deacons. A deacon in one of our congregations might refer to an elected position on a board that has representation on the church council, or it might denote the title a congregation has given one of its called workers: a staff minister."}
{"prompt": "Use of alcohol at church functions", "completion": "Our WELS church permits alcohol consumption at church functions held at our church, and at in-home Bible studies.  Why is this allowed if the Bible is very clear that we are to be sober and vigilant, sober and righteous, not to be drunkards, etc.?  There are recovering alcoholics in our church and I believe this presents a stumbling block to a brother or sister and even excludes them because of the added stress it causes them to be around a substance that is unnecessary at a church function and harmful to them.  This has been brought to the attention of our pastor and congregational leaders, and they support alcohol at church functions and at in-home Bible studies.  Your position on this matter would be greatly appreciated as we struggle with maintaining our membership at a church that does not have our best interest at heart.\r\n\n\n\nAs I am not knowledgeable of the discussions that have taken place in your congregation, let me respond in a general way.\nA starting point is that the Bible condemns the abuse of alcohol not its usage (Psalm 104:15; Ephesians 5:18; 1 Timothy 5:23). While the Bible allows the responsible use of alcohol, 1 Corinthians 8 and 10, along with Romans 14, provide guidance for Christians as they exercise their freedom\u2014including their use of alcohol.\nThose chapters from 1 Corinthians and Romans direct Christians to use their God-given freedoms not in their own best interest but in the interests of others. Christian freedom does not mean simply that I have the right to do something. Christian freedom also means that I have the right not to do something if that course of action is better for others. Certainly, not using alcohol because of a concern for others fits that loving exercise of Christian freedom.\nI would encourage this kind of scripturally-based conversation in your congregation to address the situations you have described."}
{"prompt": "The errors of Arminianism", "completion": "Classical Arminianism seems to be compatible with WELS doctrine, but we reject Arminianism as heretical. Why? Is there a statement on Arminianism in the Lutheran Confessions? If so, where?\n\n\nClassical Arminianism is not at all compatible with WELS doctrine. Arminianism teaches \u201cdecision theology,\u201d the idea that people choose to believe in Jesus as their Savior. Here are a couple of sections from This We Believe, a statement of belief of our synod, which address that false doctrine.\n\u201cWe believe that people cannot produce this justifying faith, or trust, in their own hearts, because \u2018the man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him\u2019 (1 Corinthians 2:14). In fact, \u2018the sinful mind is hostile to God\u2019 (Romans 8:7). It is the Holy Spirit who gives people faith to recognize that \u2018Jesus is Lord\u2019 (1 Corinthians 12:3). The Holy Spirit works this faith by means of the gospel (Romans 10:17). We believe, therefore, that a person\u2019s conversion is entirely the work of God\u2019s grace. Rejection of the gospel is, however, entirely the unbeliever\u2019s own fault (Matthew 23:37).\n\u201cWe reject every teaching that people in any way contribute to their salvation. We reject the belief that people with their own power can cooperate in their conversion or make a decision for Christ (John 15:16). We reject the belief that those who are converted were less resistant to God\u2019s grace than those who remain unconverted. We reject all efforts to present faith as a condition people must fulfill to complete their justification. We reject all attempts of sinners to justify themselves before God.\u201d\nIn his explanation of the Third Article of the Apostles\u2019 Creed in his Small Catechism Martin Luther wrote: \u201cI believe that I cannot by my own thinking or choosing believe in Jesus Christ my Lord, or come to him. But the Holy Spirit has called me by the gospel, enlightened me with his gifts, sanctified and kept me in the true faith.\u201d\nYou will find other references in the Lutheran Confessions on this subject in places like these: The Augsburg Confession (Article XXVIII), the Apology of the Augsburg Confession (Article XVIII) and The Formula of Concord (Article II).\nOne of the hymns in our hymnal very clearly expresses biblical teaching on conversion: \u201cLord, \u2018tis not that I did choose you; That, I know, could never be, For this heart would still refuse you Had your grace not chosen me\u201d (Christian Worship 380:1).\nWe praise God for his grace in giving us a Savior (Galatians 4:4-5) and giving us faith that connects us to that Savior (Ephesians 2:8-9)."}
{"prompt": "Explanation of Halloween", "completion": "Do you still have a question about doctrine section? My question is about how to explain Halloween to my 7-year-old granddaughter who asked if the day is another of Jesus', like Easter and Christmas are. I know it's a pagan one, and we were on our way to Treat O Trunk at our church.\n\n\nYes, there is still a question and answer section about doctrine and Christian living. That section is in the same area where you submitted your question.\nThe following is a past response to a question regarding the explanation of Halloween.\n\u201cAll Hallows Evening was a special night because it preceded All Saints Day, an important festival in the medieval church.\n\u201cAll Saints Day may have been placed on November 1 because this was the New Year\u2019s Day for the Celts of the British Isles. The Celtic festival Sambain on October 31 was concerned with the return of the souls of the dead. The connection of elements of witchcraft or the occult with October 31 thus was in competition with All Hallows Evening and All Saints Day, not a part of it. In countries in which Christianity and superstition co-existed, however, elements of the two often became entangled.\n\u201cStandard encyclopedias say that Halloween became a secular holiday in America. It apparently was introduced by the Irish and other immigrants. The emphasis is now on costumes and trick or treat, with the treat always given and the trick seldom played.\n\u201cHalloween now is a secular holiday that descended from both heathen and medieval observances. It has often had unsavory elements such as occult symbols and vandalism associated with it. The question then is whether these elements have been sufficiently detached from Halloween, and it has become a secular holiday that can be observed without offensive features. There certainly has been a concerted effort to make it so. Many public schools ban certain types of costumes that are considered too gross or offensive. Secular groups such as UNICEF have tried to replace the emphasis on getting treats for oneself with a concern for raising money to help the needy.\n\u201cThe fact that some people celebrate Halloween in offensive ways does not in itself rule out the holiday. If this were so, we could not celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve or even Christmas. The fact that Halloween occupies the same day as a heathen holiday is not unique. Many Christian holidays like Christmas and Easter in a sense compete with heathen holidays since both were associated with key points of the astronomical calendar. This is also true of the Old Testament holidays prescribed by God. Some of our Christmas and Easter customs have some similarity to heathen customs just as the Old Testament sacrifices had many points of similarity with those of the heathen. Some Christian holidays have become more secularized even while they remain important festivals of the church year (Christmas). Other minor religious festivals have almost entirely lost their religious connotation (Valentines Day). For most people St. Patrick\u2019s Day has become more of an Irish ethnic fest than a religious holiday.\n\u201cWhether or not Lutheran Christians should participate in holidays like St. Patrick\u2019s Day and Halloween is a question of judgment. Such holidays may have different meaning and different customs attached to them in different times and places. Whether Lutheran Christians should or should not participate depends on the meaning of the holiday in the context in which they live and on the impression which their participation will give to others. Naturally, they should refrain from objectionable practices if they participate. They are some good arguments that can be made against Halloween, but individuals should be convinced in their own consciences of what is best for them to do and should be cautious about judging others who may have a different opinion.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Pastors and divorce", "completion": "I have a Catholic friend who raised this question to me:  I have searched Q&A and have not found a specific answer to her question.  Could you please write me a response based on God's Word about this that I can share with her?\r\n\r\n\"Can a minister be divorced and still be a minister in your (WELS) church? Or remarry and be a minister?\"\r\n\r\nThanks so much.\r\n\n\n\nA divorce would not necessarily and automatically disqualify a man from the pastoral ministry. There are a number of unknown factors with your question. What were the circumstances of the divorce? Was the pastor\u2019s wife unfaithful to him (Matthew 19:1-9), or did she desert him (1 Corinthians 7:15)? Was the pastor guilty of unfaithfulness or desertion?\nThere can certainly be circumstances whereby a pastor disqualifies himself from the public ministry through a divorce. There can be other circumstances whereby a pastor is not guilty of sin in his divorce, but it might be best for the gospel ministry if he resigned from that particular call\u2014whether or not he seeks to remarry. There can be additional circumstances whereby a wife divorces her husband, a pastor, and the pastor remarries and continues serving in the public ministry.\nAgain, different factors like these prevent giving a simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer to your question."}

The Lord said to Satan, 'Where have you come from?'\u201d  How can Satan, who was cast out of heaven due to his rebellion, return and appear before God?\n\n\nYou ask an interesting question. All we know are the circumstances: at one point holy angels presented themselves before God, and Satan was among them.\nWhat we know from Scripture is that God banished Satan and other angels from heaven after they rebelled against him. God sent those fallen angels to hell (2 Peter 2:4). While hell is the eternal home of Satan and other evil angels, those spirit beings have the ability to roam the earth (1 Peter 5:8) as God allows; they are not entirely confined to hell at this point. The opening chapters of the book of Job illustrate very clearly that Satan is very much under God\u2019s control and can do only what God permits.\nThe time is coming when Satan and his minions will be confined to hell forever (Revelation 20:10) and will not be able to bother Christians anymore.\u00a0 How we long for that day!\nA future \u201cLight for our path\u201d column in Forward in Christ, based on a similar question, will explore this subject matter further."}
{"prompt": "The Magdeburg Confession", "completion": "The Magdeburg Confession saved the Reformation, as other Lutherans cut and ran from the teaching of salvation by God's grace alone through faith in Jesus alone. So how come it's not taught? We aren't saying they were not real Lutherans, are we ? They put their own lives on the line in place of just mouth-service to the Augsburg Confession. So how come we're not teaching about these brave Lutherans?\r\n\r\n\n\n\nLutheran church history has not forgotten the Magdeburg Confession and the Lutherans who stood up to Emperor Charles V\u2019s decree that they return to the fold of Roman Catholicism.\nHere is one example of such remembrance. \u201cThe Historical Introductions to the Symbolical Books\u201d in the Concordia Triglotta states: \u201cIn Southern Germany, Charles V and his Italian and Spanish troops, employing brute force, succeeded in rigidly enforcing the Interim outwardly and temporarily. Free cities rejecting it were deprived of their liberties and privileges\u2026Magdeburg offered the longest resistance and was outlawed three times. Defiantly its citizens declared: \u2018We are saved neither by an Interim nor by an Exterim, but by the Word of God alone.\u2019\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Foremost among the champions of true Lutheranism over against the Interimists were\u2026especially Matthias Flacius Illyricus\u2026.a member of the Wittenberg faculty.\u201d\n\u201cIn 1549, when he was no longer safe in Wittenberg, Flacius removed to Magdeburg, then the only safe asylum in all Germany for such as were persecuted on account of their Lutheran faith and loyalty, where he was joined by [other] \u2018exiles of Christ\u2019\u2026.Here they inaugurated a powerful propaganda by publishing broadsides of annihilating pamphlets against the Interim, as well as its authors, patrons, and abettors. They roused the Lutheran consciousness everywhere; and before long the great majority of Lutherans stood behind Flacius and the heroes of Magdeburg\u2026Because of this able and staunch defense of Lutheranism and the determined opposition to any unionistic compromise, Magdeburg at that time was generally called \u2018God\u2019s chancellery.\u2019\u201d (pages 96, 100)\nLutheran Reformation history covers many personalities, events and writings. The Magdeburg Confession certainly has its place in that history\u2014especially as it sought to outline biblical principles that addressed tyrannical governments that encroached on the mission and responsibilities of the church."}
{"prompt": "Governmental authority and obedience", "completion": "Since God set up both, which government, local or Washington, are we to obey when they differ? Seems to me the smart thing to do is obey the one that can do immediate\r\nharm and worry about the other later.  Would that be correct? \n\n\n\u201cLet everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God\u201d (Romans 13:1). We are to obey all governmental authority, at all levels, unless government authorities intend to force us to sin and go against God\u2019s word (Acts 5:29).\nIf we disagree with laws\u2014federal, state or local\u2014there are peaceful options available to us to voice our concerns and seek legislative change."}

Correct ? \n\n\nWe would not recognize gangs as legitimate governmental authorities. Gangs tend to compete with legitimate governmental authorities.

{"prompt": "Recommendations for funeral planning", "completion": "I am 78 and preparing my wishes for my funeral.  I am in good health but want all of this in order before something does happen to me.  I'm struggling with two things - what I want on my headstone and what Psalm I would like my funeral sermon based on.  I will be buried next to my parents.  They have \"Cling To the Cross\" on their headstone.  I would like something short and meaningful as well.  If someone could give me maybe three suggestions for the headstone and also Psalms to choose from, that would be wonderful.  Thank you for your time and assistance.\n\n\nI actually worked in a cemetery for five summers in my student days, so I saw many, many headstones. Unfortunately, I did not write down the better and more meaningful inscriptions that I observed.\nMeaning inscriptions that do come to mind are: \u201cTo live is Christ and to die is gain\u201d (Philippians 1:21), \u201cIn the cross of Christ I glory\u201d (Christian Worship hymnal 345:1), \u201cHeaven is my home\u201d (Christian Worship 417), and \u201cI am the resurrection and the life\u201d (John 11:25).\nThere are many psalms that could serve well as sermon texts for a Christian funeral service. Again, some that come to mind are: Psalm 23, Psalm 27, Psalm 46, Psalm 103 and Psalm 121. Personal preference will determine if an entire psalm or selected verses are suggested as the sermon text. Your pastor would be a good resource to utilize in making decisions in these areas.\nI do commend you for making these plans. All too often, these plans can be left to surviving family members who must then make decisions in a short window of time regarding suggested sermon texts and Scripture readings.\nFinally, how wonderful it is that you and I can make plans like these in full confidence in what our Lord promises: \u201cI am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die\u201d (John 11:25-26). God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Jesus forsaken on the cross", "completion": "When Jesus was being crucified, why did He say to God, \"My God, My God, why hast though forsaken me?\"  Did God deny Jesus as His Son and the Savior?\n\n\nWhen Jesus spoke those words from Psalm 22, he was describing the punishment he was enduring: he was being abandoned and forsaken by his heavenly Father. Jesus was acting as our substitute. By our sins, we deserved to have God sentence us to hell and forsake us forever. On the cross, Jesus stepped in as our substitute and suffered what amounts to hell. Jesus did that so we would never have to know what abandonment from God is all about.\nGod forsaking God? Martin Luther asked: \u201cWho can understand it?\u201d Thankfully saving faith is not a matter of having perfect understanding (Hebrews 11:1). In the Bible God speaks the truth, and Spirit-worked faith accepts it.\nAt Calvary God showed himself to be a just God by punishing sin in his Son, and he demonstrated that he is a gracious God by sacrificing his Son to spare sinners (1 John 4:10).\nAnd what is our Christian response to all this? We join in the chorus of praise: \u201cWorthy is the Lamb, who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and praise!\u201d (Revelation 5:12) \u201cTo him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise and honor and glory and power, for ever and ever!\u201d (Revelation 5:13)"}
{"prompt": "Christian faith and marriage", "completion": "Why does God not want people to be married to unbelievers if we are called to be examples for others to follow?  If I meet someone when I am older and he doesn't believe in God, wouldn't it be unloving of me to reject him and leave him?  Why, since God is loving, does He tell people not to be with people who don't know God's love?\n\n\nI am not sure where you are looking in Scripture to come away with a conclusion that God forbids Christians from marrying outside the faith. It could be 2 Corinthians 6:14-18. People often cite that section of Scripture as proof that Christians are not to marry unbelievers, but it is clear that the context of that section is not speaking about marriage.\nAllow me to pass along a \u201cLight for our path\u201d column that addressed a similar question about a year ago in Forward in Christ. The response in that column is much more complete than what I can provide in this question and answer forum.\nThis link will take you to that column."}

I would suggest that it is the work of the Holy Spirit in their hearts. Love is part of the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23). The Spirit works and develops that attitude in Christians\u2014clergy and laity alike\u2014as they come into contact with God\u2019s gospel in word and sacrament.\nIf you met pastors who wanted to help people, I would say you saw pastors who were \u201cpracticing what they preach.\u201d Our pastors encourage showing love to others (1 John 4:7), even our enemies (Matthew 5:43-48). Our pastors speak of helping people as opportunities arise (Galatians 6:10).

They may express their fellowship by joint worship, by joint proclamation of the gospel, by joining in Holy Communion, by joint prayer, and by joint church work. God directs believers not to practice religious fellowship with those whose confession and actions reveal that they teach, tolerate, support, or defend error (2 John 10, 11). When error appears in the church, Christians will try to preserve their fellowship by patiently admonishing the offenders, in the hope that they will turn from their error (2 Timothy 2:25, 26; Titus 3:10). But the Lord commands believers not to practice church fellowship with people who persist in teaching or adhering to beliefs that are false (Romans 16:17, 18).\u201d\nIndividuals outside our faith and fellowship are welcome to attend the services and classes you mentioned. They can participate as they wish, with the exception of receiving the Lord\u2019s Supper. The reception of the Lord\u2019s Supper is an expression of unity of faith (1 Corinthians 10:17). Apart from serving in a leadership role in worship, individuals outside our faith and fellowship can be attendants in a church wedding.\nI hope this was the information you were seeking."}
{"prompt": "Rending garments and hearts", "completion": "The Jewish practice of keriah is tearing of clothes when a loved one dies:  why did they do this?\n\n\nIt was an ancient custom of expressing grief, anger, shock and sorrow. Its purpose was to serve as an outward display of inward emotions.\nIn that regard, it is interesting to see the message God had for the people of Judah through the prophet Joel: \u201cRend your heart and not your garments. Return to the LORD your God, for he is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love, and he relents from sending calamity\u201d (Joel 2:13). Much like Isaiah would write later (Isaiah 1:11-17), the prophet Joel informed God\u2019s people that God was interested in much more than outward indications of repentance and faith. God was\u2014and still is\u2014interested first and foremost in the condition of people\u2019s hearts. God wants all to repent (2 Peter 3:9) and enjoy salvation through faith in Christ (1 Timothy 2:4)."}
{"prompt": "Teachings of Seventh-Day Adventists", "completion": "What are the basic teachings of the Seventh-Day Adventists? Why would a Seventh-Day Adventist not want to discuss the book of Romans?\n\n\nComparing teachings of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church with the Bible reveals errors such as the following.\nThat church teaches that: Saturday is the divinely-appointed day of worship, the writings of Ellen G. White have prophetic authority, baptism is only a symbol of the believer\u2019s union with God, the Lord\u2019s Supper is a meal in which Jesus\u2019 body and blood are symbolized, there is soul-sleep after death, there is a mixture of faith and obedience to the commandments for salvation, there is a no hell, there is a millennium, and there are rules for diet and dress. The church\u2019s history includes failed predictions of Jesus\u2019 visible return on the last day.\nWhen it comes to a Seventh-Day Adventist and the book of Romans, I imagine the discomfort would be Romans 14:5-6 \u2013 a section that speaks of Christian freedom in connection with days of worship. That section is as problematic for such a person as Colossians 2:16-17 \u2013 \u201cTherefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day.

Are the damned resurrected to new flesh along with the faithful?   \n\n\nIn the Apostles\u2019 Creed we confess: \u201cI believe in the resurrection of the body.\u201d In the Nicene Creed we confess: \u201cWe look for the resurrection of the dead.\u201d The resurrection of which we speak is not limited to Christians. That becomes clear when we use the words of the Athanasian Creed: \u201cAt his [Jesus\u2019] coming all people will rise with their own bodies to answer for their personal deeds.\u201d\nThose confessions are based on Scripture. Jesus said, \u201cDo not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice and come out\u2014those who have done what is good will rise to live, and those who have done what is evil will rise to be condemned\u201d (John 5:28-29). Those last words speak of saving faith and unbelief showing themselves in everyday living.\nWhen he was on trial, the apostle Paul stated: \u201cThere will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked\u201d (Acts 24:15).\nDaniel 12:2 states: \u201cMultitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt.\u201d\n\u201cThe resurrection of the dead\u201d on the last day applies to all who have died: Christian or unbeliever."}
{"prompt": "Men's and women's roles", "completion": "Since Jesus was the ultimate sacrifice for all of our sins, and all sins have been forgiven, including Eve's sin, why is it that women still shouldn't be pastors or teach in service?\n\n\nThe lead-in to your question seems to imply that the inability for women to serve as pastors is a consequence of sin. That is not the case. 1 Timothy 2:11-13 and 1 Corinthians 11:8-9 make it clear that the roles God established for men and women have their origin at their creation\u2014before the fall into sin. The roles of loving leader for men and loving helper for women are part of God\u2019s design for people.\nJesus definitely was the ultimate sacrifice for all our sins (Hebrews 7:27). Jesus \u201cis the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world\u201d (1 John 2:2). In gratitude to God for that forgiveness, we strive to live lives that follow his will (2 Corinthians 5:15)."}

Why is it a sin for two men or two women but not for men and women to be married to each other?\n\n\nThe Bible teaches that marriage is a union between one man and one woman (Genesis 2:18-24; Matthew 19:4-6). The Bible makes it clear that sexual activity is to take place in marriage (Hebrews 13:4) and that sexual activity between people of the same sex is a violation of his will (Romans 1:26-27; 1 Corinthians 6:9-11).\nIt is not a sin for a man and a woman to be married to each other because they are in a relationship and institution that God designed.

{"prompt": "Holy Communion distribution", "completion": "LCMS churches have women giving out Communion.  Is that an acceptable role for women in the church?\n\n\nA Northwestern Publishing House publication, A Bible Study on Man and Woman in God\u2019s World, addresses the question of women assisting with the distribution of the Lord\u2019s Supper. Pertinent information follows:\n\u201cIt is clear that the Lord\u2019s Supper should be administered by the pastor or by a man authorized by the congregation to administer the sacrament in his absence. But can a distinction be made between administration and distribution? The Roman Catholic Church uses a number of lay altar assistants to speed the distribution of the elements to the entire congregation. In many parishes women distribute both the wine and the bread.\n\u201cSome European Lutherans argue that the pastor must retain distribution of the bread since it is at this point that the authority to exclude someone from the Lord\u2019s Supper must be exercised, but that women could distribute the wine since admission has already been determined by this point.\n\u201cIf the form of celebrating the Lord\u2019s Supper among us was such that the distribution of the elements was understood as simply assisting all of the congregation in receiving the elements (sort of the opposite function of gathering the offering) and if some other means of upholding the scriptural principles of closed communion was in place, it would be possible to defend the position that there are no theological grounds for excluding women from assisting with the distribution. For example, in the ancient church women were sometimes permitted to carry the consecrated elements to the sick. This was considered to be a form of distribution of the elements which enabled home-bound members of the congregation to participate in the sacrament along with the congregation.\n\u201cSuch a form of distribution without consecration of the elements in the presence of the communicant is not practiced among us. Although there are some precedents for the practice in the history of the church, I do not believe women altar assistants could be introduced in our congregations under present circumstances without serious problems of misunderstanding and even offense.\u201d (Pages 35-36)"}
{"prompt": "Wording of marriage promises", "completion": "I've read through some of the marriage rites performed by the WELS church. I was wondering if there are any options that do not include the word submit? Or if couples may write their own vows and have them approved by the pastor? Also, if a husband and wife are not in compete agreement on all religious doctrine (specifically two or three very small interpretations), can they still come together before God in prayer, or do the WELS fellowship beliefs not allow this?\n\n\nIf you plan to be married in one of our congregations, you want to speak to the pastor of that congregation about your questions that concern the marriage promises. It could be that he uses the order of service from Christian Worship: A Lutheran Hymnal; he might use another order of service.\nIf he uses the order of service from the hymnal, it becomes very clear what \u201csubmit\u201d does and does not mean. The part of the service that precedes the marriage promises states: \u201cThe pattern for Christian marriage is the intimate union of Christ and his Church, which the apostle Paul depicts in Ephesians 5. After urging believers to \u2018submit to one another out of reverence for Christ,\u2019 he makes this application for Christian spouses: \u2018Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the Church\u2026Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the Church and gave himself for her.\u2019 It is reverence for Christ on the part of husband and wife that lays the foundation for Christian marriage.\u201d\nThose words illustrate what \u201csubmit\u201d is all about. In love, Christians\u2014men and women\u2014submit to one another. While our sinful nature can rebel against putting other people first, our new self delights in doing that. In love, Christians\u2014men and women\u2014submit to Christ. Again, while our sinful nature rebels in putting Christ first, our new self delights in doing that. When we submit to Christ, it means that we look to him as our loving leader. Similarly, wives look to their husbands as the loving leader of their marriage. At the same time, God looks for husbands to love their wives with a sacrificial love patterned after Christ\u2019s love for the Church.\nAs to your last question, when people have a common faith, then they can express their fellowship by praying and worshiping together.\nAgain, you would do well to address your questions to one of our pastors."}

And his commands are not burdensome, 4 for everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith.\"  with the fact that we sin daily?  Seems to me they completely contradict each other.  Thanking you in advance. \n\n\nYou notice that the apostle John did not state in verse two: \u201cThis is how we know that we love God: by loving God perfectly and carrying out his commands perfectly.\u201d Nor did John write in verse three: \u201cIn fact, this is love for God: to keep his commands perfectly.\u201d\nThe apostle\u2019s point is that Christian faith shows itself in love toward God and love toward other people. Faith is not a quality that is hidden in a person\u2019s heart. (That is an important emphasis in the book of James as well.)\nIs our love toward God and others perfect? Not by any stretch of the imagination. Our love toward God and others is imperfect and inconsistent. But that deficiency on our part is not what the apostle John is concentrating on in the verses you cited. In those verses he is simply demonstrating how faith and love go together.\nWhen it comes to our love for God and others, and God\u2019s love for us, it is no contest.

{"prompt": "\"Increase\" in Romans 5:20", "completion": "I have a language translation question about a specific verse in Scripture. Regarding Romans 5:20, my NIV Bible uses the word \"increased\" twice in that verse--the first time referring to sin--and the second time referring to grace. I think I remember either reading or being told somewhere that in the original language, one Greek word for \"increased\" is used referring to sin (\"where sin increased\"), but an entirely different Greek word is used in referring to grace (\"grace increased all the more\"). The latter, as I understand it, is a synonym for \"increased\", yet is much more than just a simple increase. It was explained to me that this Greek word can more accurately be defined as \"an outpouring, or overflowing.\" Is my memory or understanding of this correct?\r\n\r\nIf I take a glass of water and add a very small drop to it, I have by definition \"increased\" the volume of water in the glass, albeit by a very small amount. But to add such a volume of water so as to cause the cup to \"overflow\" is another matter altogether. Thus, if my understanding of this is correct, does not the English translation of this verse fail to convey the idea of an \"overflowing\" of God's grace. To simply use the word \"increased\" both times doesn't seem to do that verse justice, does it?\r\n\r\n\n\n\nYour memory is correct. There are two different Greek verbs that the NIV translates as \u201cincreased\u201d in Romans 5:20. That translation tries to show the difference in the greater outpouring of God\u2019s grace by saying that it \u201cincreased all the more.\u201d\nMany Bible translations I checked used the same English word for both verbs but tried to show the difference in qualifying words: \u201call the more, \u201cmore exceedingly,\u201d etc. Some Bible translations tried to show the difference by using different words. \u201cWhere sin increased, grace multiplied even more\u201d (Common English Bible). \u201cWhere sin increased, grace abounded all the more\u201d (New American Standard Bible). One commentator wrote: \u201cWhere the sin increased, the grace superabounded.\u201d\nRegardless of how Bible translations render it, the beautiful truth remains: God\u2019s grace in Christ has completely removed our sins."}

{"prompt": "Christians' use of the keys", "completion": "This being the 500th anniversary of the start of the Lutheran Reformation, I have been finding myself involved in more than a few interesting conversations with Roman Catholic friends/coworkers. One topic that comes up nearly every time is Ministry of the Keys or Universal Priesthood. I was taught to use Matthew 18 and John 20 as my proof passages for what we in the WELS believe. When I bring these passages up, however, I am usually confronted with an interesting argument for which I have no good response. In both passages there is no mention that Jesus is speaking to believers in general - both passages seem to give a setting that includes only the disciples \u2013 the eleven. I understand that just because Matthew and John do not mention others does not exclude the possibility that they were present. However, I am still left wondering if we can use these passages in support of the Ministry of the Keys as being meant for all Christians. The Roman Catholic position that the Roman Catholic Church has sole possession of binding and loosing is not refuted by our proof passages. Instead, Roman Catholics use these, as well as others, to support their own position. I thought I was prepared, I guess I was wrong. May I please ask for some help with this?  Thank you. \n\n\nYou can certainly keep using Matthew 18 and John 20 as proof passages for each Christian possessing the \u201ckeys.\u201d Matthew 18:18-20 makes clear that it is Jesus\u2019 church on earth, not just his small band of disciples then, who have received his authority to forgive or retain sins. When we remember that Luke 24:33 describes who was present in the narrative of John 20:19-23, we will recognize that Jesus gave the authority to forgive or retain sins to his followers, not just the eleven disciples in Jerusalem.\nOther parts of Scripture inform us that Christians are to forgive those who sin against them and seek their forgiveness (Luke 17:4; Matthew 18:21-35). Christians can forgive others only if they have the Lord\u2019s authority to do so. In that regard, the Fifth Petition of the Lord\u2019s Prayer (\u201cForgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us.\u201d) reminds Christians that they possess the \u201ckeys.\u201d\nAs you intimated, Christians are priests before God (1 Peter 2:9) who can announce to others the news of God\u2019s forgiveness, or the message of his law.\nGod bless your spiritual conversations with others\u2014in this Reformation anniversary year and beyond!"}
{"prompt": "Faith and salvation", "completion": "I am a WELS Lutheran who comes from a modern Evangelical background. We teach that we are saved by faith alone (which is very good news), but sometimes I wonder if I truly have faith. I believe that I need Jesus and that he is the only way to everlasting life. But then I struggle with trying to keep my mindset focused on trusting in him. I want desperately to feel at peace. Is the fact that I'm worried about this prove that I have faith? Could this be a product of beliefs that I previously held that required me to choose God for salvation? Is the devil using these lies to force me to think faith is something that comes from me? Thank you and may God bless you.\n\n\nWhen churches teach that people initiate faith, that certainly puts the pressure on people. As you have come to know, we do not initiate faith; we do not bring ourselves to faith or invite the Lord into our hearts. Faith is a gift from God (Ephesians 2:8). God the Holy Spirit is responsible for faith. He gives it to people when he works in their hearts through the gospel. Because faith is God\u2019s doing, we can have certainty about it.\nWhat I could suggest is that you focus more on the object of faith, Jesus Christ, and less on the person who says, \u201cI believe in God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth\u2026\u201d You wrote that you \u201cbelieve that I need Jesus and that he is the only way to everlasting life.\u201d That is a statement of Christian faith. Thank God for that, but focus more on the gospel in word and sacrament.\nScripture certainly tells us: \u201cExamine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves\u201d (2 Corinthians 13:5). While we need to follow that instruction, we don\u2019t need to make it a continuous activity in life.\nA man once came to Jesus and said to him, \u201cI do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!\u201d (Mark 9:24) It doesn\u2019t take much to identify with that man. Through the power of the Holy Spirit, Christians like us are able to say about Jesus, \u201cI do believe,\u201d but our faith is not perfect. Our faith can be weak and wavering, plagued with doubts. What do we do? We use the very means that the Holy Spirit utilized to bring us to faith: the gospel. Through the gospel in word and sacrament the Holy Spirit strengthens our faith and deepens our conviction that we are the children of God (1 John 3:1).\nJesus said, \u201cWhoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned\u201d (Mark 16:16). You notice Jesus did not qualify the faith that saves. Even the weakest of faith saves. Jesus explained that he is not interested in snuffing out weak faith but fanning it into flame (Matthew 12:20). He can do that when we use the means through which God works to strengthen faith (Romans 10:17).\nSatan\u2019s mission is to prevent people from believing in Jesus in the first place and to get Christians to fall from the faith. When Satan attacks your faith, tell him to move on because you belong to God. How do you know? God has given you his word on that through his word and sacraments."}

We believe, teach, and confess what the Bible says, that the Word and sacraments are the means by which the Spirit creates and nurtures faith in Christ. Most other Christian churches either do not believe this, or do not emphasize this. That affects how they view the purpose of spiritual leaders in the church. To be a \u2018truly Lutheran\u2019 pastor is to understand that the focus of his ministry is to \u2018proclaim the Word faithfully and administer the sacraments rightly.\u2019 Dropping \u2018truly Lutheran\u2019 wouldn\u2019t necessarily change the lesson learned from the Bible study, but it wouldn\u2019t fit the overall theme of the series (\u2018What It Means to Be Truly Lutheran\u2019) and it would miss the uniqueness and distinctiveness of the Lutheran public ministry."}

{"prompt": "Church discipline", "completion": "How can I explain what church discipline is, and how and why it is done?\n\n\nMatthew 18:15-20 explains what church discipline is all about. It is an act of love by which Christians seek to restore someone who has sinned and is impenitent. Because impenitence bars people from the kingdom of God (1 Corinthians 6:9-10), Christians seek to share God\u2019s word with the impenitent so the Holy Spirit can work through the word to bring people to repentance, make it possible for them to enjoy the forgiveness of sins through faith and then move them to \u201cproduce fruit in keeping with repentance\u201d (Matthew 3:8).\nThe book of James ends on this note: \u201cMy brothers and sisters, if one of you should wander from the truth and someone should bring that person back, remember this: Whoever turns a sinner from the error of their way will save them from death and cover over a multitude of sins\u201d (James 5:19-20).\u00a0 Those words underscore the importance of speaking to fellow Christians about sin and impenitence.\nWhat drives church discipline is concern for the impenitent sinner and also concern for the congregation of believers (1 Corinthians 5:6-8)."}
{"prompt": "Remaining elements of the Lord's Supper", "completion": "Is Christ's body and blood present in, with, and under the bread and wine that is not consumed but has been consecrated (leftover from the Lord's Supper)? \r\nWhere in Scripture is the basis for the idea of some Lutherans that the extra consecrated bread and wine must be eaten or destroyed (poured in ground/burned) rather than put back with the yet to be used bread and wine?   \r\nMy understanding is consecration is \"setting apart for a holy purpose,\" not a magical moment that makes the body and blood present; so is it really wrong to put it back rather than consume or destroy it?  \n\n\nUnderstanding what Scripture says about the Lord\u2019s Supper led to this statement in one of our Lutheran Confessions: \u201cTo preserve this true Christian doctrine concerning the Holy Supper, and to avoid and abolish manifold idolatrous abuses and perversions of this testament, the following useful rule and standard has been derived from the words of institution: \u2018Nothing has the nature of a sacrament apart from the use instituted by Christ\u2019 or \u2018apart from the action divinely instituted.\u2019\u201d (The Formula of Concord. Thorough Declaration. VII. Of the Holy Supper.)\nThe sacramental action in the Lord\u2019s Supper is the consecration, distribution and reception of the bread and wine. The leftover elements stand apart from that sacramental action. That would allow for the storage and reuse of the unused wafers, and wine from individual cups and the flagon.\nBecause the unused elements were set aside for use in the celebration of the Lord\u2019s Supper, people have taken different approaches\u2014based on their thinking and guided by their consciences\u2014on what to do with the bread and wine that was not distributed in the Lord\u2019s Supper. Over the years practices have included consuming the leftover elements or disposing of the wine in a special sink that bypasses the regular wastewater system and instead deposits the wine on the ground outside the church. Other churches simply dispose of the leftover wine through a regular sink and drain.\nLike many parts of church life and the Christian life in general, there is freedom in this area.

{"prompt": "The unchanging word of God", "completion": "I had a conversation with someone about Scripture and something she said that confused me was that since since society changes, God's laws and His Scripture changes - meaning also that the things God calls sin are now acceptable parts of society, so they are no longer sins.  For example, now it is no longer a sin for people to have children without being married first because it has become a normal part of our society.  She mentioned how the Bible says it is a sin for women to have their heads uncovered and how now most women don't follow that.  Does God's word change with societal changes and if not, how is the example of the women wearing head coverings explained? \n\n\nGod\u2019s word does not change with societal changes. God does not change with societal changes. Consider what God says about himself and his word.\n\u201cGod is not human, that he should lie, not a human being, that he should change his mind\u201d (Numbers 23:19). \u201cBut you [God] remain the same, and your years will never end\u201d (Psalm 102:27). \u201cYour word, LORD, is eternal; it stands firm in the heavens\u201d (Psalm 119:89). \u201cThe grass withers and the flowers fall, but the word of our God endures forever\u201d (Isaiah 40:8). \u201cI the Lord do not change\u201d (Malachi 3:6). \u201cHeaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away\u201d (Matthew 24:35). \u201cJesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever\u201d (Hebrews 13:8). \u201cEvery good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows\u201d (James 1:17).\nPeople do not change what God calls sin by their consensus of words or actions. If that were the case, the flood of Noah\u2019s day would never have taken place. The truth of the matter is that people\u2019s sins brought down God\u2019s punishment: \u201cThe LORD saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time\u201d (Genesis 6:5).\nIf ending the lives of the unborn in the womb has become an \u201cacceptable part of society,\u201d it does not mean that that murder is no longer a sin. The unchanging word of God says, \u201cYou shall not murder\u201d (Exodus 20:13). If having children without first being married has become an \u201cacceptable part of society,\u201d it does not mean that sexual relations outside the marriage bond is no longer sinful. The unchanging word of God says, \u201cMarriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral\u201d (Hebrews 13:4). People do not determine morality, or right or wrong. God does.\nYou want to correct your friend\u2019s understanding of what the Bible says about women\u2019s head coverings. In 1 Corinthians 11:16, the apostle Paul identifies the head coverings of the Christian women in Corinth as a \u201cpractice\u201d or custom. A local practice or custom is far different from a universal principle from God, binding all women of all time to do the same. Because the Bible limits the instruction of head coverings to the women of Corinth in the first century by calling this a \u201cpractice,\u201d women of other places and times are not bound to that instruction.\nIt is dangerous when people think they can undo God\u2019s law. Similarly, it is dangerous when people think they can undo and replace God\u2019s way of salvation. If the majority of people think they can save themselves by being good and trying hard, that does not undo what God says about salvation (Mark 16:16; Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:4-7).\nYou could help the person who spoke to you the best by sharing some of these Bible passages with her.

Scripture says to all Christians: \u201cSo in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham\u2019s seed, and heirs according to the promise\u201d (Galatians 3:26-29)."}
{"prompt": "Texas church shooting", "completion": "After the news of the church shooting in Texas, a friend asked:  \u201cA shooting in church? 27 Killed? Women and children? It\u2019s God\u2019s house. Where was he? \u201c\r\nHow do you answer a question like this? I didn\u2019t know what to say.\n\n\nWhen tragic events like this take place, people can easily question God\u2019s power and love. \u201cIf he can do anything, why didn\u2019t he do something and prevent the shootings?\u201d \u201cIf God really loves all people, why would he allow those people to suffer like that?\u201d Unfortunately, in some people\u2019s minds God is even more to blame than the perpetrator.\nCould God have prevented that horrible incident from taking place? Certainly. God can do anything. Job chapters 38-42 illustrate God\u2019s unlimited power.\nIf we back up in time, God could have prevented the fall of Adam and Eve\u2014the event to which all sins can be traced. If we back up to eternity, God could have prevented the fall of Satan and the other evil angels. God did not prevent those twin falls from taking place. God does not explain in the Bible why he allowed those events to take place\u2014nor does God have to.\nThe church shooting in your question is tragic indeed. People gathered in a Christian house of worship, and a man gunned them down. The question your friend asked seems to suggest that worshipers in a church should receive a special level of safety and protection from God. Nowhere in the Bible does God promise that. In fact, during his ministry, Jesus once referred to an incident that could have been the church shooting of that day: Jewish worshipers in Jerusalem were cut down\u2014and not by a troubled man but by agents of the government (Luke 13:1). Sadly, places of worship are not exempt from violence.\nWhen tragic events take place in life and leave us and others with questions, we turn to Scripture. There we re-learn what a vast difference there is between God and us. What are some of those lessons? \u201cFor my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,\u201d declares the LORD. \u201cAs the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts\u201d (Isaiah 55:8-9). \u201cOh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out! \u201cWho has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?\u201d \u201cWho has ever given to God, that God should repay them?\u201d For from him and through him and for him are all things. To him be the glory forever! Amen\u201d (Romans 11:33-36).\nThose verses tell you and me that we cannot pretend to know fully God\u2019s ways and explain them to others. God knows what he is doing. He is still in control of the world he created (Revelation 19:6).\nYears ago, I read about a man whose son died fighting in the Vietnam War. He was angry at God and asked a pastor, \u201cWhere was God when my son died?\u201d Among other responses, the pastor said, \u201cThe same place he was when his own Son died.\u201d In other words, the death of a loved one does not mean that God has withdrawn his love or power. When deaths or other tragedies strike, Christian faith still recognizes a loving God\u2014a God whose ways we cannot always understand, but a God who says, \u201cI\u2019m still leading the way. Follow me.\u201d\nPerhaps you can share some of these thoughts with your friend."}

As you suggest, the information that enters our minds before we sleep can easily become the stuff of dreams.\nPerhaps you would find value in adapting the following hymn verse as a bedtime prayer: \u201cWhen in the night I sleepless lie, My soul with heav\u2019nly thoughts supply; Let no ill dreams disturb my rest, No pow\u2019rs of darkness me distress.

{"prompt": "Second day of creation", "completion": "Hello, I agree with WELS that the Bible is the inerrant Word of God, but I have always wondered what the water in the sky above the vault is at the beginning of Genesis.  What is your explanation?  Thanks so much for your time!  \n\n\nYour question addresses the second day of creation: \u201cAnd God said, \u2018Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water.\u2019 So God made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it. And it was so. God called the vault \u2018sky.\u2019 And there was evening, and there was morning\u2014the second day\u201d (Genesis 1:6-8).\nIn the People\u2019s Bible Commentary on Genesis, Prof. John Jeske offered two possible explanations for the water in the sky above the vault. \u201cThere are those who think that \u2018the water above the expanse\u2019 consisted of the clouds, the huge quantities of atmospheric water vapor which are held in suspension and are periodically precipitated in the form of rain or snow, only in turn to evaporate and return to the clouds. This is the hydrologic system under which we live today, and there are those who believe this same system was in operation on the second day of creation.\n\u201cThere are many, however, who have difficulty with that view. In Genesis 2:5 we learn that \u2018the Lord God had not sent rain on the earth.\u2019 How long did that rainlessness last? Is it possible that the hydrologic system initiated on the second day of creation was completely different from the one under which we live?\n\u201cMany have found support for this in 2 Peter 3:3-7\u2026Many have seen in St. Peter\u2019s words an indication that the flood brought about a basic change in earth\u2019s hydrologic system. In that case the \u2018water above the expanse\u2019 may well have been a vast transparent canopy of water vapor\u2026This huge canopy would have provided a uniformly warm temperate climate and a healthful environment for earth dwellers.\u201d (Pages 15-16)\nThe biblical creation account presents a wise and loving God who made all things in an orderly way by his powerful word. All creation praises him\u2014even the \u201cwaters above the skies\u201d (Psalm 148:4)."}

{"prompt": "Sin and the Christian", "completion": "Where in the Bible does it say that we as believers deserve the punishment of hell? There are certainly many verses in the Bible that say that the punishment of sin is death (e.g. Romans 6:23), but these are all referring to physical death. There are also many verses that say that a lack of faith deserves hell as a punishment (2 Thessalonians 1:8-9), but where does it say that the act of sin is deserving of hell? On WELS documents I have read online (such as in the Sin Questions section), there is constant reference to us deserving hell without any scriptural backing and in church I am repeatedly told that I deserve hell. Our loving God does not say a single word about a believer deserving hell, so why are we telling congregations what God does not? If it is inaccurate that we deserve hell as believers, why give people that awfully false message when instead the message should be rejoicing that our faith ensures us eternal life with God?\n\n\nAs you indicated, the Bible does speak of sin meriting death (Romans 6:23). Ezekiel 18:20 states similar truth: \u201cThe one who sins is the one who will die.\u201d\nWhen the Bible connects death with sin, it does so in three different ways. The Bible speaks of temporal death (Hebrews 9:27), spiritual death (Ephesians 2:1) and eternal death (Matthew 25:46). The basic idea behind death is separation. When temporal death takes place, the body and the soul are separated. Spiritual death refers to unbelievers whose souls are separated from God in this life because of sin and unbelief. Eternal death is the eternal separation of people in hell from God.\nIn the Garden of Eden, God instructed Adam, a perfect child of God in every way, that \u201cyou must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die\u201d (Genesis 2:17). Adam\u2019s transgression meant that his body would, from that time on, head toward the grave. But the consequences of his transgression were much more serious than that. Sin had dashed the perfect relationship he had enjoyed with God and with Eve. Sin threatened to separate him from God forever. A loving God stepped in and promised a Savior who would crush sin and Satan and death (Genesis 3:15).\nThe nature of sin is that it separates people from a holy God (Isaiah 59:2). Sin is serious. Disobedience merits God\u2019s punishment (Galatians 3:10). Thankfully, Jesus took on himself the punishment our sins deserved (Galatians 3:13).\nSo, where does this leave us as Christians? We have a sinful nature. That connection to Adam alone convicts us as \u201cguilty\u201d in God\u2019s court of law (Romans 5:12-21). Our sinful nature is thoroughly corrupt (Romans 7:18) and wants nothing to do with God or godliness. Because following the lead of our sinful nature can lead to (more than physical) death (Romans 8:13), we seek to keep our sinful nature under control by saying \u201cno\u201d to sin and by responding to sin in our lives with contrition and repentance.\nWe still sin. Any sin is deserving of God\u2019s punishment (Galatians 3:10). As Christians though, we stand in grace (Romans 5:2). We enjoy forgiveness of sins through faith in Jesus Christ (Romans 5:1).\nBecause sin is serious, Jesus instructs us what to do when a Christian sins against us (Matthew 18:15-20). The book of James ends on this note: \u201cWhoever turns a sinner from the error of their way will save them from death and cover over a multitude of sins\u201d (James 5:20). That is how serious sin\u2014and unrepented sin\u2014is.\nYou can see that part of the answer to your question is that Christians need the message of God\u2019s law and the message of God\u2019s gospel. Because of our sinful nature, we need the message of the law to serve as a mirror and a curb. For our comfort and the strengthening of our new self, we need the message of the gospel. As children of God, the message of the gospel will predominate, but there is definitely a place for the law."}
{"prompt": "Baptism and salvation", "completion": "What does it mean to be saved?  What does it mean to be born again?  How does a person in the WELS church know if they have the gift of eternal life/salvation?\r\n\r\nIs Baptism essential to salvation/going to heaven?  What exactly do you believe happens when an infant is baptized related to faith and salvation?  \r\n\r\nThank you for your time!\r\n\n\n\nTo be saved means to enjoy in faith the blessings Jesus Christ won for all people by his perfect life and innocent death: forgiveness of sins, peace with God and eternal life in heaven.\nBeing born again (John 3:5-8; 1 Peter 1:23) describes the converting work of the Holy Spirit.\nThe assurance of salvation comes from God himself. His gospel message declares people forgiven through the work of Jesus Christ (John 3:16; 10:27-28; Matthew 26:28; 1 John 1:7; 2:2). The salvation won by Jesus is enjoyed through God-given faith in him (Mark 16:16; Romans 5:1; Ephesians 2:8-9).\nWe speak of Baptism being necessary in the sense that the Lord commands us to administer Baptism. However, Baptism not absolutely necessary for salvation because the Holy Spirit can bring people to saving faith in Jesus through the gospel in Word alone. In situations like that, people will still want to be baptized\u2014to do what Jesus says and to receive, in addition to the message of the Bible, another guarantee of God\u2019s love and forgiveness in Christ.\nWe believe that the Holy Spirit can work through Baptism to create the faith in infants and children that connects them to Jesus. We baptize children because they have a need for baptism by their sinfulness (Psalm 51:5), they can believe (Psalm 8:2; Luke 18:15-17) and they are part of the object of the great commission \u2013 \u201call nations\u201d (Matthew 28:19)."}

{"prompt": "Pastors and the liturgy", "completion": "Why do the pastors turn their backs on the congregation when they pray during service?\n\n\nThe altar in a church reminds us of how all the Old Testament sacrifices on an altar pointed ahead to Jesus\u2019 sacrifice on the cross, and \u201cthat without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness\u201d (Hebrews 9:22).\nFor New Testament worshipers, the altar in a church also represents the presence of God through Word and sacraments. For this reason, a pastor will face the altar when he speaks to God with worshipers or for worshipers. A pastor will face the congregation when he speaks for God, as in announcing the forgiveness of sins.\nGod has not commanded that pastors conduct the liturgy in this manner. These are practices that the Christian Church has developed in Christian freedom, but these practices are meaningful when we understand what is behind them."}
{"prompt": "Doctrinal errors and impenitence", "completion": "If Baptists can go to heaven without repenting of Baptist beliefs that are sinful, why can't someone who commits murder or homosexual sins and doesn't repent and say they still are believers also go to heaven? \n\n\nWhat you want to do is differentiate between saving faith that is weak, and impenitence. Impenitence over sin bars people from the kingdom of God (1 Corinthians 6:9-10).\nCertainly, rejection of any part of God\u2019s word is serious (Deuteronomy 4:2; 12:32; Revelation 22:18-19) and potentially faith destroying. Lutheran dogmaticians have acknowledged the possibility of a \u201chappy inconsistency\u201d when there might be saving faith in a person\u2019s heart along with doctrinal error because of ignorance or weakness of faith, but we cannot identify this with accuracy, so we leave it in God\u2019s hands.\nYour question underscores the importance of regarding all of Scripture as truth (John 17:17) and living life in accordance with God\u2019s will (2 Corinthians 5:15)."}
{"prompt": "Priorities in life", "completion": "I was speaking with a Catholic friend of mine a while back about how Catholics view their priorities in life, and it made me think of several questions for WELS.  This Catholic friend explained that Catholics believe that in a person's list of priorities, God is first, family is second, and the church is third.  Additionally, this friend explained that God, family, and the church are intertwined, even with this list of priorities.  I think it brings up several questions for us in the WELS.  Should we consider WELS churches to take priority over our families?  Or do our families take priority over our WELS churches?  I think most people would say that their immediately family takes priority over a WELS church, which is essentially a collection of other people with common beliefs worshiping God.  But I do think there are some in WELS who would argue that WELS takes priority over the family.  How would you answer these questions?\n\n\nI can reduce the tension that exists in trying to prioritize life\u2019s events by recognizing that I serve God when I serve my family and others. Jesus\u2019 parable of the sheep and the goats (Matthew 25:31-40) illustrates that service to others is service to him. The apostle Paul explained that love for others includes love for God (Galatians 5:14). The apostle John described how love for others and love for God go hand in hand (1 John 4:20-21). I recognize that there are \u201ctwo tables\u201d of the law, but when I arbitrarily draw a line that separates service to others from service to God, I lose sight of the unity of my Christian life of service.\nMight I still have scheduling conflicts among events involving my personal life, family life and congregational life? Certainly. When those conflicts arise, I will attempt to make the best decision for the use of my time. I know I cannot be perfect in the use of my time, abilities and resources, so I ask God to forgive my shortcomings and empower me through his gospel for future, faithful Christian service."}

{"prompt": "Father and salvation", "completion": "My father knows God is real, but he doesn't want to follow God.  He turned away from God when we were babies.  Since he believes in God but doesn't follow him, where will he go when he passes away?\n\n\nYou state that your father \u201cknows God is real, but he doesn\u2019t want to follow God,\u201d I am not entirely sure how to understand that information. We do know from the Bible that mere knowledge of God does not lead to salvation (James 2:19). Jesus said, \u201cWhoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned\u201d (Mark 16:16). Saving faith goes beyond knowledge and the affirmation that such knowledge is true. The essence of saving faith is trust and reliance on God for salvation (Psalm 31:14).\nWhen you say your father \u201cbelieves in God but doesn\u2019t follow him,\u201d I try to picture what that looks like. Does that mean your father professes faith in Christ but refuses to be part of a congregation? Does that mean your father refuses to do what God says in the Bible regarding living as a child of God? Does that mean your father rejects the Bible as God\u2019s word?\nYou could help your father by asking him what he believes. Ask him what he thinks of Jesus Christ. Ask him what he believes will happen to him when his earthly life comes to an end. His answers will tell you how to respond with appropriate verses from the Bible. If you need help finding such verses, your pastor can help.\nLike the rest of us, your father is presently enjoying a time of grace. God is granting your father life so that, through the power of the Holy Spirit, he can come to repentance and faith in Jesus Christ (1 Timothy 2:4; 2 Peter 3:9). Keep sharing God\u2019s word with your father, so that the Holy Spirit can use that word to work in his heart.\nAs you share God\u2019s word with your father, keep praying for your father. Pray that God will lead your father to believe the truth of God\u2019s word and confess that with his life. God bless you and your family."}
{"prompt": "Voting in congregations", "completion": "As I understand it, the WELS position on women in the church deals with authority over a man.  Yet nothing is stated about shared authority. In other words, if a woman casts a vote at a voters' assembly meeting, isn\u2019t it really that she is exercising authority with a man?  To me it seems like the only authoritative vote is one cast that breaks a tie because that vote carries authority. Isn\u2019t Paul talking about authority in such a way as over a man?  The Scriptures don\u2019t address voters assemblies, but it appears that WELS has defined the application of authority for every one of its churches. Shouldn\u2019t each church decide what constitutes authority and what doesn\u2019t?  Some churches might not allow women voting but others might. Isn\u2019t it okay for churches to apply the same principles differently and still walk together?\n\n\nThe voters\u2019 assembly is the authoritative governing body of the congregation. It calls and removes pastors, teachers and staff ministers. It accepts and excommunicates members. These are all authoritative decisions. A woman would not be exercising authority with a man by casting votes on these or other matters.\nIn addition, we want to keep in mind that there are more authoritative actions than voting in a voters\u2019 meeting. There is often a good deal of authoritative action in the debate that precedes a vote.\nAs a synod, we have made this confession: \u201cWe believe that women may participate in offices and activities of the public ministry except where that work involves authority over men (1 Timothy 2:11.12). This means that women may not serve as pastors nor participate in assemblies of the church in ways that exercise authority over men (1 Corinthians 11:3; 14:33-35).\nNone of this negates what God says about men and women in his kingdom: \u201cSo in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham\u2019s seed, and heirs according to the promise\u201d (Galatians 3:26-29).\nNorthwestern Publishing House offers a couple of resources on this topic.

{"prompt": "Romans 1:16", "completion": "What does the phrase \"To the Jew first\" mean?\n\n\nI am understanding your question to be in connection with Romans 1:16 \u2013 \u201cFor I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile.\u201d\nA starting point is keeping in mind that the content of John 3:16 is not a truth restricted to the New Testament. No, God has always loved all the people of the world. While God promised and sent a Savior for all the people of the world, God made those promises to and fulfilled those promises through the people of Israel, the Jews. For that reason, the gospel message needed to be shared especially with the Jews, but not to the exclusion of Gentiles.\nJesus demonstrated that close connection between God\u2019s plan of salvation and the Jewish people when he spoke of his ministry being directed \u201conly to the lost sheep of Israel\u201d (Matthew 15:24), when he reminded the Samaritan woman that \u201csalvation is from the Jews\u201d (John 4:22) and when he instructed his followers to spread his word (Luke 24:47; Acts 1:8).\nThe phrase in your question references the people through whom God fulfilled all the promises of the Savior. It does not speak of a God who shows favoritism (Acts 10:34-35; Romans 2:11)."}
{"prompt": "Communion consecration", "completion": "Is the pastor the only one able to consecrate the bread and the wine for Communion? If called by the congregation due to a vacancy or inability of a pastor to conduct the Communion service, can an elder of the church or a called male worker in the day school be allowed to consecrate the bread and the wine for the Communion service, similar to an elder being able to administer Communion to shut ins or nursing home elderly? Please clarify and give me biblical references for your position.\n\n\nYour question has been asked and answered previously. Allow me to pass along the previous response: \u201cThe Lord\u2019s Supper is given to the Church. Ordinarily, the congregation calls a pastor to publicly administer the sacrament on its behalf. We cannot say dogmatically that one must be ordained to validly consecrate the Lord\u2019s Supper, but the regular practice of the Lutheran church has been that only pastors acting in the name of the congregation do this. It has not been considered \u2018appropriate\u2019 for laymen to consecrate the Lord\u2019s Supper under ordinary circumstances.\u201d\nSome biblical references associated with that answer would include Matthew 18:15-20 (the ministry of the keys is given to the church), 1 Peter 2:9 (all Christians are priests before God), Ephesians 4:11 (God has established the public ministry), Romans 10:15 (the church calls individuals to serve in the public ministry), 1 Timothy 3:1-10 (those individuals are qualified to serve in the public ministry), 1 Corinthians 14:40 (the church is to use Christian freedom \u201cin a fitting and orderly way\u201d) and 1 Corinthians 10:32 (the church is concerned about its members when it contemplates change from its normal practices)."}
{"prompt": "Confessing the faith", "completion": "Is it right to keep our faith secret or go against our convictions (taking vaccines made from the cells of aborted children, for example) if not doing so would put the lives of others, especially Christians, at risk? Or is it better to publicly profess our faith and accept the consequences? Church history suggests the former, but the Bible suggests the latter. The question arose when I watched the synod convention and the feed was cut off when the Chinese representatives took the floor; a friend of mine remarked that it would be \"more Christian\" to allow their identities to be revealed and let the Chinese government act against them, as \"they would be going to heaven anyway.\" I argued that doing so would be reckless and a sin against the Fifth Commandment.\n\n\nLike you, I would not categorize the scenario you referenced as one in which individuals kept their faith secret. There was a public confession of faith in a very large setting, but there was also a course of action that recognized and addressed their dangerous situation.\nWhen the Lord sent out his disciples, he explained the dangers that awaited them, and he also instructed them, among other things, to be shrewd in their actions (Matthew 10:16).\nCertainly, God\u2019s will is that we display our faith in everyday life (Matthew 5:13-16). When Christians find themselves in hostile situations, they will prayerfully determine how they can best do that\u2014taking into account any consequences that might result in their own lives and the lives (and ministries) of others who might be miles away from them.\nWhat we do not want to do is disown our Lord (Matthew 10:33) or sin against our conscience (Romans 14:23)."}
{"prompt": "Reception of Holy Communion", "completion": "Do you have open or closed communion? Do I have to be a member of a WELS church to receive Communion?\n\n\nOur practice is close communion. It is the historic and biblical practice of the Christian Church. The practice has the purposes of ensuring that, as far as humanly possible, those receiving the Sacrament do so to their benefit and not their harm (1 Corinthians 11:27-30), and that the oneness that is expressed in receiving the Sacrament is genuine and not contrived (1 Corinthians 10:17).\nReception of Holy Communion is an expression of unity and fellowship with others who receive it. How do we know that those who receive the Sacrament are united in the faith with one another? We certainly cannot look into their hearts, but we can hear their common confession of faith. That is where church membership enters the picture. We see church membership as a way in which Christians acknowledge Jesus before others (Matthew 10:32) and publicly indicate their unity in faith and doctrine with fellow believers.\nWhat this means in practical terms is that our pastors commune those who belong to churches of our fellowship. This link will take you to the website of the Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference, which explains our worldwide fellowship.\nI would encourage you to speak to the pastor of your local WELS congregation to learn what it might mean for you to join that congregation."}

With that understanding, I will proceed.\nI am wondering if there is a way that you can maintain contact with your son and his wife without regularly bringing up the topic of his spiritual life. Please don\u2019t misunderstand me. What is going on in his spiritual life is serious and dangerous. He already knows that from previous conversations with you and his pastor. What your son really needs in his life is a regular Christian influence.\nAlthough the apostle Peter was addressing wives and husbands, his words (1 Peter 3:1) can be applicable in a father-son relationship like yours. Let your son see your Christian faith and example. Certainly, share with him truths of Scripture as you can, but let him see your faith in action.\nBeyond your example, are there other Christian friends, congregational members or family members who could reach out to your son with their Christian love and Christian witness? Who are the Christian people your son respects and might allow to offer Christian influence and conversation?\nI probably don\u2019t have to remind you to pray, so I will encourage you to think about enlisting the help of fellow Christians to ask God to work in your son\u2019s heart (and the heart of your daughter-in-law). Pray that God brings about right attitudes and beliefs toward the Bible and the only Savior from sin, Jesus Christ. Neither you nor your pastor can change anyone\u2019s heart, but God certainly can. I will join you in prayer that God does just that. God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Theologians and doctrine", "completion": "When there are differing views over something like baptism by very scholarly theologians, how can the lay person know which interpretation is correct? Thank you.\n\n\nWhat can be helpful is keeping in mind how \u201cscholarly theologians\u201d might view the Bible in the first place. This link will take you to a \u201cLight for our path\u201d column that explains how many theologians today approach Scripture.\nWith that background in place, if \u201cscholars\u201d have their minds made up what baptism is and is not, they will look to Scripture to find support for their views. That, of course, is completely backwards from how we are to read the Bible. We are to read the Bible and come away with the truths that God has expressed.\nMany \u201cscholarly theologians\u201d read the Bible through the lens of human reason. If words of Scripture do not make sense to them, they inject a meaning that is sensible to them. So, for example, since some people believe that they are responsible for Christian faith, they reject infant baptism. In addition to a denial of original sin, their line of thinking is that an infant does not possess the intellectual abilities to comprehend what is going on in baptism, and so they are not in a position to make a decision for Christ.\nWhen we understand that Christian faith is a gift from God (Ephesians 2:8), then we will recognize that God can give that gift to young and old alike through his gospel in word and sacrament. And then, we will not put limitations on the great commission (Matthew 28:19-20)\u2014baptizing only adults.\nSo, what are you to think when \u201cscholarly theologians\u201d reach wildly different conclusions on what the Bible says? I would encourage you to read the Bible for yourself and follow the principle of letting \u201cScripture interpret Scripture.\u201d\nDon\u2019t downplay your role as a Bible interpreter compared to \u201cscholarly theologians.\u201d Martin Luther\u2019s well-known observation about laity and theologians was this: \u201cA simple layman armed with Scripture is to be believed above a pope or a council without it.\u201d That goes for a simple professor too."}

There were unforeseen and unplanned events or circumstances, but there was nothing bad about them.\nThat brings us to another definition of \u201caccident\u201d \u2013 \u201can unfortunate event resulting especially from carelessness or ignorance.\u201d The dictionary then supplements that definition with examples of accidents dealing with pain or loss of some kind.\nThose kinds of accidents did not exist in Adam and Eve\u2019s perfect world, nor will they be a part of ours. In the new heaven and new earth that will be our eternal home, the Bible says that \u201cThere will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain\u201d (Revelation 21:4).\nThat perfect existence is not \u201cunforeseen or unplanned.\u201d It is God\u2019s will for his children."}
{"prompt": "Equipped to witness to Muslims", "completion": "I apologize if this question has been asked once before. I have a co-worker who is a devout Muslim and attends his Mosque regularly to pray. Sometimes we get into religious discussions, but the language barrier is very thick. He says that Allah is the same as the God of Moses and Abraham and that Jesus and Muhammad are the same, but I don't believe this. My question is, how do I go about sharing the message of Jesus Christ with him? I don't know enough about the Islamic faith to point out the differences to him. Thank you!\n\n\nYou certainly have the right idea. As you think of witnessing to people about Jesus Christ, you want to know something about their faith so that you can ask pertinent questions and be aware of topics you might be addressing with them.\nBecause your question requires a response that would be lengthier than appropriate for this question and answer forum, probably the best help I can provide is directing you to a very useful book by the title of Speaking the Truth in Love to Muslims. There may be a copy in your church library. If not, the book and a Bible study with DVD are available from Northwestern Publishing House.\nAmong other things, the book will clearly explain that Allah is not the same as the God of Moses and Abraham, nor is there any similarity between Jesus and Muhammad. Chapter ten of the book should be especially helpful for you. It is titled: \u201cWitnessing to Muslims.\u201d\nGod bless your witnessing efforts!"}
{"prompt": "Worship leaders", "completion": "Is a non-WELS person (another Lutheran synod, Catholic, Baptist, etc.)  permitted to solo during the funeral service of a WELS member in a WELS church?  \n\n\nSingers and musicians\u2014those who serve as worship leaders in regular or special worship services in our churches\u2014do need to be of our fellowship.\nThe Bible encourages us to work together with those who have a common faith and to work together to promote the truth (3 John 8). At the same time God, through the Bible, tells us to separate from and not join in fellowship activities like worship with those who are not one in faith with us (Romans 16:17; Titus 3:10; 2 John 10-11).\nWhen people belong to a church, their membership acknowledges acceptance of that church\u2019s beliefs. It is the comparison of the church\u2019s beliefs with the Bible, not an examination of the individual\u2019s heart, that leads to a determination of whether or not there can be the enjoyment of fellowship activities like worship.\nWhen I answer questions like this, I like to point out that we are talking about the difference between visible churches and the invisible church, the Holy Christian Church. WELS and the churches you listed are visible churches. If a person from one of the visible churches you listed is not able to sing a song in one of our churches, we are not saying the person is not a Christian, nor are we pretending to read what is in the person\u2019s heart. We are happy when a person\u2019s sincere confession of Christian faith identifies him or her as a member of the Holy Christian Church, the invisible church. But only God knows who belongs to that Church; you and I operate in the realm of visible churches. So, while we may have a common membership in the Holy Christian Church with other Christians, their membership in a visible church outside our fellowship prevents us from doing the things we might like\u2014like singing at a funeral service.\nIf you would like to read more about our biblical fellowship practices, this link will take you to the appropriate section of This We Believe, a statement of belief of our church body. And, finally, please do speak to one of our pastors if you have other questions related to the one you submitted."}
{"prompt": "Suicide and faith", "completion": "When someone takes their own life for various reasons, do they have a chance to go to heaven if they have always believed in Jesus Christ?\n\n\nA significant phrase in your question is \u201cfor various reasons.\u201d People have taken their lives for various reasons. Some who did so might have been suffering from psychological or mental health issues. Others might have committed a rash act in a moment of weakness. Still others might have ended their lives in unbelief.\nThe Bible teaches us that Christian faith saves and unbelief condemns (Mark 16:16). The Bible explains the need to have Christian faith in the heart when life on earth comes to an end (Revelation 2:10). The Bible informs us that judgment takes place at death (Hebrews 9:27). While we do not know the judgment that takes place at a person\u2019s death, that judgment will be made public on the last day (Matthew 25:31-46).\nIn years past, individuals who took their own lives were often treated as a group: they were automatically considered to be people who were lost forever. In more recent times there has been a greater understanding of psychological and mental issues that might have contributed to a person taking his or her life, while still dying in the Christian faith. This does not minimize the seriousness of suicide or its tragic effects on survivors; it provides explanation only.\nGod makes it clear in the Bible that only he\u2014directly or indirectly through his representatives in government\u2014has the right to end a person\u2019s life (Deuteronomy 32:39; Psalm 31:15; Psalm 90:3; Romans 13:4). God is serious about protecting a person\u2019s life because that is the only time a person has to be brought to saving faith in Jesus Christ.\nAny threat or expression of ending one\u2019s life needs to be taken very seriously. If you are aware of such threats or expressions, do speak to that person and/or the proper authorities."}
{"prompt": "Free will and the Christian", "completion": "Has WELS always believed in \"free will\" in the works of this life? I grew up WELS and I thought I distinctly remembered that WELS did not believe in free will. I see the website says:  Human beings have a free will in works of this life. But only the Holy Spirit, working through God\u2019s Word, can lead a person to love God. So now I'm confused. Maybe I have just misunderstood the secret of my life's choices the last 55 years?\n\n\nEver since the fall into sin in Eden, the free will that people have is limited to making decisions about their earthly lives. So, people choose to marry or remain single, enter into this or that vocation, live in a certain area, etc. Of course, when it comes to making decisions like those, people may not always get what they want.\nAfter the fall into sin, people by nature can choose only evil in the spiritual realm. \u201cThe mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God\u2019s law, nor can it do so\u201d (Romans 8:7). \u201cEvery inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time\u201d (Genesis 6:5). \u201cEvery inclination of the human heart is evil from childhood\u201d (Genesis 8:21). Because of natural sin and unbelief, people are God\u2019s enemies; they want to do only that which displeases God.\nThen, when we consider passages like 1 Corinthians 2:14, Ephesians 2:1 and Colossians 2:13, we understand that even if we wanted to choose to believe in Jesus, we could not do that because we were spiritually blind and dead by nature. All we could do was sin and reject God.\nThankfully, God did what we could not and did not want to do: he connected us to Jesus Christ in faith so we could enjoy all the blessings he won by his holy life and innocent death, and which are guaranteed by his glorious resurrection from the dead.\nAs a child of God, my free will is much different than before my conversion. Now my new self wants to use the means of grace to strengthen my faith; now I want to follow God\u2019s law as a tangible way of showing my thankfulness to him for my salvation in Jesus his Son. However, even when I, as a child of God, want to do those things in life that are good and godly, I recognize that it is God working in me: \u201cIt is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose\u201d (Philippians 2:13).\nAs you look back on your life as a child of God, and as you look ahead, thank God for the wonderful freedom he gives you to determine each day how to serve him and others."}
{"prompt": "Clerical collars", "completion": "Is wearing of a clerical collar becoming more acceptable? I hope so. I never had a WELS pastor yet that wouldn't be fit to wear one.  I have loved all my WELS pastors - best pastors on the planet.  And my pastor came to church wearing one for the first time.  He said it gives him more opportunity to talk about Jesus to strangers.   \n\n\nI do not know if I can point to any kind of trend developing in our synod.\nThe wearing of clerical collars fits into the category of adiaphora: those things that God has neither commanded nor forbidden. While wearing a clerical collar might more commonly be associated with clergy of other denominations, it is an option for clergy of our church body.\nAs you indicated, and as the term suggests, a clerical collar identifies a person as a member of the clergy. That identification can open doors for conversations about the faith.\nAs it is with any change in congregational life, pastors will do well to speak to their members about the rationale behind their use of a clerical collar. Such conversations can address any misunderstandings that might exist.\nThank you for your kind words about our pastors. I hope many of them read your words."}
{"prompt": "Synods and the Lord's Supper", "completion": "May an LCMS member take Communion at a WELS church after professing their faith to the pastor, and vice-versa?\n\n\nOur pastors are happy to commune people who belong to churches of our fellowship. An LCMS (The Lutheran Church\u2014Missouri Synod) member represents his or her church, and because WELS and LCMS are not in fellowship with one another, we refrain from communing together, as the reception of the Lord\u2019s Supper is an expression of unity in the faith (1 Corinthians 10:17). The individual profession of a person is one thing, but a person\u2019s profession of faith by his or her church membership is what we really need to consider. We see church membership as a way in which Christians acknowledge Jesus before others (Matthew 10:32) and publicly indicate their unity in faith and doctrine with fellow believers.\nOur practice in WELS is not unique. LCMS states on its website: \u201cThe official position of the Synod is that not only are members of other Lutheran churches with whom we are in altar and pulpit fellowship [my emphasis] invited to commune with us, but also that in certain extraordinary cases of pastoral care and in emergencies members of churches not in fellowship with us may be given Communion.\u201d WELS also allows for extraordinary cases and emergencies, but we recognize LCMS\u2019 position of normally communing those \u201cwith whom we are in altar and pulpit fellowship.\u201d That would exclude WELS.\nWhile WELS and LCMS are not in fellowship with one another, you may or may not be aware that the two synods, along with the Evangelical Lutheran Synod (ELS), have met annually for the last six years to share information and to be better informed on areas where there is agreement and disagreement. This link will take you to a report that describes the most recent meeting."}

{"prompt": "Wife's potential employment", "completion": "My wife is looking at working in a capacity that would promote a casino/resort. Initially, I thought it could be fine. The Bible does not explicitly forbid gambling.  (That does not make it right, however.) The casino is one part of the resort's activities. One could run into a similar problem promoting a hospital that performs abortions (but \"abortions\" are not what one thinks when they hear the word \"hospital,\" whereas when one hears \"casino\" they think \"gambling\") or owning a liquor store. What are your thoughts on such a situation? I understand that if one has doubts, one should not go against their conscience. That is another little wrinkle. My wife doesn't really have doubts, citing biblical examples of people who worked within sinful organizations, such as Daniel, Shadrach, Meschach and Abedego, etc. I'm the one trying to clear my doubts. I've also consulted my pastor, but I am looking for further input. Thanks.\n\n\nYou are correct in putting this situation in the area of one\u2019s conscience. While the Bible does not specifically address the subject of gambling, the Bible does warn against greed (Luke 12:15) and instruct us to look not only to our own interests but the interests of others (Philippians 2:4). Against the backdrop of passages like those and others, Christians might arrive at different conclusions about the appropriateness of working at a casino/resort.\nI am going to pursue one of the thoughts you passed along, and that is that \u201cthe casino is one part of the resort\u2019s activities.\u201d There certainly may be guests/customers who visit that place of business only to visit the casino because they are motivated by greed and concern only for their lives. There may be other guests/customers who visit that place of business for entertainment, recreational activities, meals or relaxation. An employee at such a business is bound to interact with some people with attitudes of greed or unselfishness. But that is true of some other\u2014perhaps, unlikely\u2014businesses.\nAn employee at a convenience store/gas station might ring up a lot of sales in gasoline, food and\u2026lottery tickets. Perhaps there are regular customers who load up on lottery tickets on a predictable schedule. Those people are not going to casinos to gamble; they\u2019re simply stopping at a gas station on the way home to gamble. The employee interacts with customers who have different attitudes toward money.\nAnother employee in a brokerage firm is part of a support team that provides services for conservative and savvy investors\u2014and perhaps also for people who look upon day trading as sophisticated gambling. Those people take great financial risks to get more and more money. The employee is part of a company that serves people who have different attitudes toward money. Those are just a couple examples of employees who provide products that greedy people can abuse.\nThe biblical examples your wife cited do illustrate God-fearing people who were able to maintain their faith in and devotion to God while being in the employ of foreign, ungodly governments. Certainly, their involvement in those governments was not an endorsement of all the governments\u2019 activities.\nSo where are we after all this? You and your wife need to sort out what the concerns of her possible employment are, how legitimate those concerns are and how serious they might be. You want to arrive at a consensus so that there is not a wedge of any kind between the two of you. Prayerfully determine how both of you can use life to glorify God (1 Corinthians 10:31) by serving others (Galatians 6:10). I will offer similar prayer."}
{"prompt": "Unity in faith", "completion": "As I understand it, WELS teaches that there must be complete doctrinal unity before any kind of joint Christian activity can take place amongst believers.  And yet when I read your proof passages they all seem to be related to the key teaching of Scripture -- justification by faith alone in Christ alone.  Isn't it impossible on this side of heaven to be \"in perfect agreement?\"  It seems like WELS would say that if we agree on everything except who we identify as the Antichrist, we can't pray together.  Yet, in Philippians 3:15-16, Paul seems to imply that there is room for disagreement on non-fundamental teachings yet still be together.  \n\n\nThe \u201cChurch and Ministry\u201d section of This We Believe, a statement of belief of our church body, explains what we teach and profess about doctrinal unity and fellowship.\n\u201cWe believe that God directs believers to acknowledge oneness in faith with Christians whose confession of faith submits to all the teachings of Scripture (John 8:31; 1 Thessalonians 5:21,22). We believe, furthermore, that individuals through their membership in a church body commit themselves to the doctrine and practice of that church. To assert that unity exists where there is no agreement in confession is to presume to look into people\u2019s hearts. Only God can look into people\u2019s hearts. It is not necessary that all Christians agree on matters of church ritual or organization. About these the New Testament gives no commands (Romans 14:17).\n\u201cWe believe that those who confession of faith reveals that they are united in the doctrines of Scripture will express their fellowship in Christ as occasion permits (Ephesians 4:3). They may express their fellowship by joint worship, by joint proclamation of the gospel, by joining in Holy Communion, by joint prayer, and by joint church work. God directs believers not to practice religious fellowship with those whose confession and actions reveal that they teach, tolerate, support, or defend error (2 John 10,11). When error appears in the church, Christians will try to preserve their fellowship by patiently admonishing the offenders, in the hope that they will turn from their error (2 Timothy 2:25,26; Titus 3:10). But the Lord commands believers not to practice church fellowship with people who persist in teaching or adhering to beliefs that are false (Romans 16:17,18).\u201d\nAs indicated, the Scripture passages used to explain what we teach and profess about doctrinal unity and fellowship are not limited to the subject of justification by faith alone in Christ alone.\nWhen it comes to Philippians 3:15-16, the phrase \u201csuch a view of things\u201d in verse fifteen takes us back to the previous verses where the apostle Paul was speaking of zealousness in living the Christian life not classifying doctrines of the Bible.\nUnity in the faith is a precious gift of God the Holy Spirit. We thank him for it. We seek to preserve it. We look for greater expressions of it."}

This encouragement would not include suggestions or recommendations regarding how to vote on any particular issue or candidate.  Please include Bible references regarding your response.

What our churches cannot do, as you indicated, is endorse any candidate for political office. Doing so would be a violation of the Internal Revenue Code.\nParticipating in the election process is part of responsible citizenship.

{"prompt": "\"Lead us not into temptation\"", "completion": "There have been recent press mentions about a possible mistranslation of the \"Lead us not into temptation\" petition in the Lord's Prayer. Does WELS have a comment or position on this issue?  \n\n\nThere is no mistranslation involved in the Sixth Petition of the Lord\u2019s Prayer. \u201cLead us not into temptation\u201d is an accurate translation of the Greek. The verb can mean \u201clead, bring in or carry in.\u201d The challenge can be answering the question: \u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d\nI cannot improve on Martin Luther\u2019s answer to that question in his Small Catechism: \u201cGod surely tempts no one to sin, but we pray in this petition that God would guard and keep us, so that the devil, the world, and our flesh may not deceive us or lead us into false belief, despair, and other great and shameful sins; and though we are tempted by them, we pray that we may overcome and win the victory.\u201d\nLuther offered similar thoughts in his Large Catechism: \u201cThis, then is leading us not into temptation, to wit, when He gives us power and strength to resist, the temptation, however, not being taken away or removed. For while we live in the flesh and have the devil about us, no one can escape temptation and allurements; and it cannot be otherwise than that we must endure trials, yea, be engulfed in them; but we pray for this, that we may not fall and be drowned in them.\u201d\nLuther\u2019s thoughts point to James 1:13-15: \u201cWhen tempted, no one should say, \u2018God is tempting me.\u2019 For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; but each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire and enticed. Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death.\u201d\nScripture clearly teaches that God does not tempt anyone to sin. Scripture plainly identifies Satan as \u201cthe tempter\u201d (Matthew 4:3). When we use the prayer Jesus taught us, we do what he first told his disciples in the Garden of Gethsemane: \u201cWatch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation\u201d (Mark 14:38).\nAs we let \u201cScripture interpret Scripture,\u201d we understand what \u201cLead us not into temptation\u201d means and does not mean. That approach to biblical interpretation helps us understand other Bible passages that, on the surface, can be confusing."}
{"prompt": "Importance of worship attendance", "completion": "I am a life-long WELS member.  My wife and I were married in a WELS church and she is a life-long Lutheran - Missouri Synod until after we met.  My kids all attended a WELS church K-8.  Now that the kids are all out on their own, my wife and children have chosen to no longer be members of the church.  They no longer attend any church.    My question is, what words can I use to help share with them the importance of regular church attendance?  They have said, \"I can be a Christian without attending a church.\" \n\n\nI am sorry to hear about your family\u2019s attitudes toward worshiping God in church. Let me put your question and situation in scriptural context.\nThe new self of a Christian readily agrees with King David, \u201cI rejoiced with those who said to me, \u2018Let us go to the house of the LORD\u2019\u201d (Psalm 122:1). Our new self loves God\u2019s word, desires to hear God\u2019s word, longs for opportunities to worship God in church and seeks to praise God in everyday living (1 Corinthians 10:31).\nOn the other hand, the old self, the sinful nature, of a Christian hates God\u2019s word, wants nothing to do with worshiping God in church and desires to live only for self (Galatians 5:17).\nIf people who profess Christian faith express ideas that are contrary to God\u2019s word, it is their old self, not the new self, that is responsible for those ideas.\nSo, what does God\u2019s word say about worshiping him? The Bible stresses the importance of gathering for worship with fellow believers (Hebrews 10:25). Jesus promises his gracious presence to those assembled for worship (Matthew 18:20). Jesus explained how his followers hear his word and continue in it (John 8:31, 47). Worship services provide opportunities for the message of Christ to dwell among us richly (Colossians 3:16). Worship services provide opportunities for God\u2019s people to receive the Lord\u2019s Supper. Through the Lord\u2019s Supper, God offers and gives forgiveness of sins, life and salvation. God\u2019s will is that we are guests of his Supper often (1 Corinthians 11:25-26). When we worship God in church, we are engaged in the important work of acknowledging him before others (Matthew 10:32; Luke 12:8). Worship services provide opportunities for God to nurture and strengthen faith through his gospel in word and sacrament (Romans 1:16). You can remind your family of these truths.\nYou can also remind them that the use of God\u2019s word in worship services will provide ongoing \u201cteaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness\u201d (2 Timothy 3:16). One wonders how regularly that happens apart from worshiping with fellow believers.\nI encourage you to be an example for your family in your own church attendance and personal devotional life. Let them see godliness in action. Keep praying that God will change their attitudes and actions. God bless you and your family."}
{"prompt": "Choir in civic setting", "completion": "Our areal Lutheran high school  sings in a civic setting with other choirs (public and parochial) in an annual \"honors event\" that educates the participants and recognizes their skills.  This year the guest conductor picked a Mendelssohn piece that tells the biblical account of Elijah and the prophets of Baal.   Scripture is depicted so some lyrics say \"Baal is god\" while later showing the Lord's victory and grace to Elijah.   Two things bother a few students and parents.  1.  Singing that Baal is god. 2.  Concern that fellowship principles have been violated.   \r\nI don't believe they have been because the setting is not an attempt to unite them in faith. That's neither the intent nor the purpose of the concert.  Here's my base question you could consider.  \"Would it be a violation of what the Lord teaches about our fellowship in Christ and His word for a WELS member or choir to sing a Christian song in a civic choir at a civic setting with other choir members not of our faith?\"  \n\n\nWELS\u2019 Conference of Presidents appointed a special fellowship study committee to assist schools with situations like this. Recently, the committee developed a \u201ctoolbox\u201d of materials and resources that features a Bible study on the doctrine of fellowship.\nArea Lutheran high schools received these materials. The schools also received encouragement to develop a plan and provide an orderly process for those responsible to work through the study materials.\nI would encourage you to contact individuals in the administration of your particular area Lutheran high school to learn about the ways in which the materials were used and applied to your setting."}
{"prompt": "Supporting friend at time of tragedy", "completion": "A close friend, Lutheran but not WELS, recently experienced tragedy in her family.  Her brother and nephew were killed by another family member.  She was a churchgoer and taught Sunday School at her church before, but now is at a point where she is angry at God that this happened and not going to church as often because of it.  How do I spiritually support her through this without pressuring or pushing her away?  \n\n\nAs it is with any tragedy, you want to do a lot of listening to your friend. Address her pain and anger as you can by pointing her to truths from God\u2019s word. As it turns out, your situation has parallels to a question I will be answering in the February 2018 \u201cLight for our path\u201d column in Forward in Christ. Here is a little preview of it.\nWhen tragic events take place, people can easily question God\u2019s power and love. Could God have prevented your friend\u2019s family members from being killed? Certainly. God can do anything (Genesis 18:14; Jeremiah 32:27). God could have prevented sin from entering the world in the first place, but he did not do that. In the Bible God does not offer explanation for that\u2014nor does he have to.\nWhen tragic events take place, the truth remains that God is still in control of the world he created and preserves. God\u2019s wisdom far surpasses ours (Isaiah 55:8-9; Romans 11:33-36). We cannot pretend to know or understand completely God\u2019s ways. What we can know\u2014in faith\u2014is the love of God.\nWhat you can do is direct your friend to turn to Scripture where she can hear again the message of God\u2019s love for her. The tragedies that take place in a sin-filled world do not negate the love of a gracious God who sacrificed his own Son for the sins of the world.\nHopefully, your friend\u2019s pastor is aware of her situation and can provide spiritual counsel. Perhaps you could suggest that she receive grief counseling. Continue to pray for your friend. Continue encouraging her, by word and example, to trust in the Lord always and \u201cnot give the devil a foothold\u201d (Ephesians 4:27). God bless your support of your friend."}

I am struggling as I feel that he is telling God \"You made a mistake and I am a woman.\"  I need some scriptural support here, please. And this falls under forgiving others for their sins?

{"prompt": "The message of Jesus and Paul", "completion": "Did Jesus and Paul preach different gospels? I read someone's writing (claiming to be teaching clear biblical truth) that Jesus' \"gospel of the kingdom\" is different than Paul's \"gospel of grace.\"\n\n\nJesus and Paul preached the same gospel. Jesus taught that faith alone saves (Mark 16:16; John 3:14-16). Paul taught the same message (Romans 3:28; Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:5). Jesus taught that he is the only Savior for people\u2019s sins (John 14:6). Paul taught the same message (1 Corinthians 3:11).\nThe kingdom of which Jesus often spoke during his earthly ministry refers to his gracious rule in people\u2019s hearts through faith (Luke 17:20-21). Paul taught that same message (1 Corinthians 4:20).\nThe teachings of Paul and Jesus are the same. That should not surprise us, as Paul explained that the source of his teachings was Jesus Christ himself (Galatians 1:11-12). Your question addresses the perfect unity of the Bible. For that unity, we thank God."}
{"prompt": "\"Lutheran\" in church name", "completion": "Is it true that some of our new home missions do not have Lutheran as part of their name?  If so, what is the reason?\n\n\nThose whom I consulted regarding your question explained that, to their knowledge, our churches have \u201cLutheran\u201d in their official name. It is my understanding that some churches might not use the name Lutheran in their outreach materials because in their part of the country people either tend to equate Lutheranism only with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) or they have little or no knowledge of Lutheranism in general.\nAn appropriate mission mindset is one that seeks, first and foremost, to connect people to Jesus Christ. God brings about that connection as he works in the hearts of people through his gospel (Romans 10:17). Because God wants Christians to gather together for worship (Hebrews 10:25) and to work together to spread the gospel (Mark 16:15), we also seek to connect people to a home congregation and the wider church body."}
{"prompt": "The nature of sin", "completion": "Is something a sin if it is thought about, or is it only a sin if a person actually goes through the process of committing the sin?\n\n\nWhen we gather together for worship and confess our sins, we often use these words: \u201cHoly and merciful Father, I confess that I am by nature sinful and that I have disobeyed you in my thoughts, words, and actions.\u201d With those words, we speak biblical truths.\nWe, like all people, are conceived and born with a sinful nature (Psalm 51:5; John 3:6; Ephesians 2:3). That sinful nature produces all kinds of sinful thoughts, words and actions (Mark 7:21-22; Galatians 5:19-21).\nThe transgression of God\u2019s will is not limited to words or actions. The Bible points to the thoughts and desires of our heart as the origin of sinful words and actions (James 1:14-15). God makes it clear that sinful thoughts are as wrong in his sight as sinful actions (Matthew 5:28; 1 John 3:15).\nThe wonderful news of the gospel is that Jesus Christ was our perfect substitute in life. He never harbored any evil thoughts. He never uttered sinful words or committed sinful actions. His life was in complete conformity with the will of his Father. More than that, Jesus then was our innocent substitute in death. On the cross, he paid for all our sins\u2014including our sinful thoughts.\nIn gratitude for the gift of forgiveness, we seek to live for God (Romans 12:1). That includes striving to control our thoughts and think only those things that are pleasing to God (Philippians 4:8)."}
{"prompt": "Names of our churches", "completion": "Why do we emphasis Martin Luther by using \"Lutheran\" as part of our church name when we learned in 1 Corinthians 3 that Christ is to be the focus not his disciples? Likewise, why do we name our churches St. Paul's, etc.? Shouldn't our church names instead emphasize \"Christian\" rather than \"Lutheran\" or \"John, Peter, Paul...\"? While all of these men are followers of Christ, there only is one Christ and only through Him are we saved. Isn't naming a church after a human taking the focus off of Jesus Christ our Savior?\n\n\nElsewhere on this website, you will read this: \u201cNearly 500 years ago, the Christian church was corrupted by many false teachings. A man named Martin Luther led people back to the teachings of the Bible. His work, and that of his friends, is called the Reformation. Through Luther God restored the church to purity of doctrine and a new life of faith in Christ.\n\u201cThe doctrines of the Lutheran Church are not new. They are the teachings of the Bible. Thus the Lutheran Church is not a new church. It is not a sect or cult. It is a church whose teaching is based on the words written by the prophets of the Old Testament and the apostles of the New Testament. The Bible tells us about Jesus Christ.\n\u201cThe teachings of the Lutheran Church are those of the original, ancient church of the apostles and early Christians.\u201d\nDuring this 500th anniversary of the Lutheran Reformation, many writers (myself included) have cited Luther\u2019s words in which he stated his desire that a church not be named after him. However, people called those who taught what he taught from Scripture \u201cLutherans,\u201d and the name has stuck.\nIt is not that we apologize for the name.\u00a0 The name is helpful. Yes, we are Christians first, but many people who deny truths of the Bible also call themselves Christian. The \u201cLutheran\u201d title helps to differentiate churches in the Christian world.\nWhen it comes to the names of individual Lutheran churches, we are in the realm of Christian freedom. Founding members will often determine the name of their new church. Can churches take on human names in their titles? Yes. Consider how the Bible speaks of the foundational nature of the apostles and prophets (Ephesians 2:20), in that God used them to deliver his word to us. Yet, the Church is built squarely on Jesus Christ (Ephesians 2:20). He alone is Savior (John 14:6).\nThe problem in Corinth that you cited was that Christians were putting more emphasis on the messengers of the gospel than the gospel message. They were taking sides over God\u2019s messengers who served them\u2014past and present. Paul wanted them to focus on Christ.\nThere would be a similar problem today if a Lutheran church called itself \u201cSt. John\u2019s Ev. Lutheran Church\u201d and then focused so much attention on the apostle John that Jesus and his gospel faded into the background. You do not find that happening in our churches. Even with names that include apostles, our churches focus on Jesus Christ.\u00a0 The symbol of a cross, along with the church name, helps keep the focus on Christ.\nYour question illustrates that church names have value and can be helpful, but we really understand what a church is all about by its confession and preaching and teaching."}
{"prompt": "Miscarriage and the Bible", "completion": "What does the Bible say about a miscarriage?  My son recently lost a very early stage child due to this and I am curious how our church body views this.  Thank you.  \n\n\nAllow me to pass along my sympathy to you and your family. May the God of all comfort (2 Corinthians 1:3-11) uphold and strengthen you all through his gospel.\nI have to say that the Bible does not specifically address your question. What we do know from Scripture is that: all people are sinful from the very beginning of life (Psalm 51:5; John 3:6); Jesus lived and died for all people (2 Corinthians 5:15; 1 John 2:2); his kingdom includes infants and children (Luke 18:15-16); and, God uses his gospel to work saving faith in people (Romans 10:17). When a life ends before we can administer Baptism, we leave that person in the hands of a holy, just and loving God whose ways and wisdom far surpass ours (Isaiah 55:8-9; Romans 11:33-36).\nPerhaps you will find value in reading a short article that Martin Luther wrote in 1542. The article is \u201cComfort for women who have had a miscarriage.\u201d This link will take you to that article. While we recognize that prayer is not a means of grace, Luther does place appropriate emphasis on the power of prayer (James 5:16) in the context of parents who prayed for their unborn child in the womb.\nGod bless you and your family."}
{"prompt": "Help in speaking to family about end times", "completion": "I grew up in a family who wandered from church to church over the years, finally landing in a WELS church. However, my siblings and other friends I know are premillennial dispensationalists in their thinking. It is not a surprise that my siblings are a little misguided from all the wandering growing up. My question is, how do I communicate the truth about the great tribulation, the rapture and the 1000-year reign of Christ to my family and friends who believe in these false teachings? I am aware of the book at Northwestern Publishing House, \"End Times: Jesus is Coming.\" It is on my list of books to order, but is there any guidance I could get now to help my friends and family see the truth? I know that prayer works best, but these things come up from time to time and would like to know the best way to respond, rather than backing out of a conversation because of lack of understanding on the subject. Thank you.\n\n\nI could suggest that you have a discussion with your family members on the basics of biblical interpretation. In other words, how are we to read and understand the message of the Bible?\nOne principle of faithful biblical interpretation is to consider Bible verses in their proper context. Let me apply that principle to just one of the subjects you mentioned: the rapture.\nThose who believe that God will whisk Christians out of this world prior to judgment day point to 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 for support. A careful reading of that section of Scripture, however, reveals that the apostle Paul was writing about events connected to the last day\u2014not events removed in time from the last day. It is Christians who are alive on the earth on judgment day who \u201cwill meet the Lord in the air\u201d (1 Thessalonians 4:17). Moving that event prior to judgment day is illegitimate and inaccurate biblical interpretation because the context is violated.\nIf you focus attention on keeping Bible verses in their proper context, you will teach your family members an important lesson. And, as long as you are ordering books from Northwestern Publishing House, you might benefit from a book on biblical interpretation. This link will show you some possibilities. God bless your testimony of his word."}
{"prompt": "God's names", "completion": "How can the Bible be called infallible and inspired when the personal name of the One who inspired it was removed some 7,000 to 8,000 times? I know the words Lord/LORD/God/Jehovah etc. are replacements along with other words, but these are admitted changes to Scripture, thus admissions of errancy (and without clear scriptural support while only supported by traditions of men rooted in rabbinic Judaism and Catholicism). The name YHWH was given as a remembrance, a blessing, a statement of jealousy for His will and people. The name YHWH should not be hidden/cloaked within His Word.  To be clear, this question is not about speaking out loud the personal name, but restoring it to Scripture.   \r\nPerhaps the most telling question to ask is this, \u201cWould the Almighty be pleased or displeased by His name not being directly found (everywhere He put it) in His Scriptures?\u201d\r\n\n\n\nElsewhere on this website you will find information related to your questions. The following two paragraphs are from a report of the Translation Liaison Committee of our synod. Their comments are in the context of an evaluation of the then-Holman Christian Standard Bible. Their observations are applicable to your questions.\n\u201cWe will grant that there is a certain consensus among scholars that something like \u2018Yahweh\u2019 approximates the way this divine name would have been pronounced. To suggest that this view is unanimous, however, would overstate the case. At any rate, the point is really moot, since we believe it is neither possible nor necessary to recapture exactly the way an ancient Israelite would have pronounced the name of God. We disagree with any suggestion that, if only we could pronounce the Tetragrammaton [YHWH] more in keeping with the way an ancient Israelite did, the result would somehow be a more \u2018accurate\u2019 presentation of God\u2019s Word, or a deeper relationship with God for a modern Bible reader.\n\u201cFurthermore, we question the assertion that \u2018Yahweh\u2019 is \u2018the personal name of God (emphasis ours)\u2019\u2014as if God has only one personal name, which can be separated categorically from God\u2019s titles or epithets. On one hand, there is the long-standing debate over the etymology of \u2018Yahweh\u2019 and what exactly the word connotes (cf. God\u2019s own etymology in Exodus 3:14). On the other hand, we wonder whether it is really true that when used in Scripture, [\u201cAdonai,\u201d \u201cEl,\u201d \u201cShaddai,\u201d and \u201cElyon\u201d \u2013 the Hebrew words occur here] cannot be considered \u2018personal names\u2019 for God in any sense at all.\u201d\nBy substituting \u201cLORD\u201d for the Tetragrammaton, Bible translators are following the practice of Old Testament believers. The truth of Scripture is that God has revealed himself by many, many names and titles. All those names and titles give us information about the only true God. When we use God\u2019s name to pray, praise and give thanks, we \u201challow\u201d his name. God is certainly pleased with that."}
{"prompt": "\"Baptized for the dead\" in 1 Corinthians 15", "completion": "Would you please explain 1 Corinthians 15:29? \"If the dead are not raised at all why are people baptized for them?\" I believe the dead in Christ will be raised when Jesus returns, but I don't understand the \"baptizing of the dead\" part.  Thank you.\r\n\n\n\nIf you were to read the commentary on this verse in The People\u2019s Bible (1 Corinthians, pages 149-150), you would find this: \u201cOur first impression is that early Christians practiced vicarious baptism; one person could be baptized for another and thus could transfer his salvation to another. But the Bible clearly teaches that each person is saved by his own baptism and by his own faith. A God-fearing mother cannot believe or be baptized for a godless son.\n\u201cIf it was not a vicarious baptism that Paul had in mind, then what was the practice he was referring to? More than three hundred different interpretations of this passage have been offered. Several of the interpretations that put the best construction on the practice are: 1) The relative of a Christian who has died may wish to be baptized in order to see this Christian again; 2) He may want to express the hope that a Christian friend who had died will rise; 3) The baptism and the godly life and final death of their friends in the sure hope of a blessed resurrection prompt the living also to desire and receive baptism for the same blessed purpose.\n\u201cIn any event, even if there was a baptism for the dead that was prompted by the false notion that the baptism of a living person would benefit an ungodly person already dead (baptism by proxy), the practice would have been meaningless if the dead don\u2019t rise. By referring to such an unscriptural practice (if, indeed, it existed) Paul was not condoning it. He was simply stating that even such a custom was a testimony to the reality of the resurrection.\u201d\nIn summary, the apostle Paul speaks of a practice of which the Christians in Corinth were aware, but we today are not. That leaves us with questions\u2014unanswered questions. Regardless of the unknown practice, the emphasis in that verse and throughout the entire fifteenth chapter is on Jesus\u2019 physical resurrection from the dead. There is no uncertainty about that event. Many eyewitnesses saw the risen Lord. Earlier in 1 Corinthians 15 Paul listed some of those eyewitnesses.\nThe People\u2019s Bible series offers explanation and commentary on all the books of the Bible. Your church library may have that series. The series is also available through Northwestern Publishing House."}
{"prompt": "The Christian and government", "completion": "RE: Today's Online Devotion 12-28-17\r\nOnce again, I am puzzled, confused, and troubled when reading Romans 13: 1-5.  In particular the words, \"For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong.\"\r\nHistory is littered with governments and leaders who abused the innocent or otherwise are peaceably going about their business doing what is right, and the peoples rising up to throw off the yoke of oppression.  Certainly our own United States nation was formed from a rebellion against established authority.  Yet, on the Sunday near the 4th of July, I don't hear sermons or prayers condemning the actions of our forefathers, but rather, (rightfully) giving thanks for our country and government.  It seems like we are preaching and teaching out of both sides of our mouths. \r\nWhile we certainly acknowledge our governmental leaders, past and present, are sinful and flawed human beings capable of error and mistakes, I think in general we say our country has always tried to do \"good\" in the general sense, given the particulars of any given point in time.\r\nI would like to think Paul was qualifying the type of government God wants us to obey.  If we were to read the morning news and find out that the people of North Korea were rising up in an attempt to overthrow the regime, would we pray for the rebellion to be quashed, or would we rather see it as God's hand at work?  I think the latter.  I would welcome your response.  Thanks!\r\n\n\n\nRather than with only a celebratory attitude, there is reason to look back at the formation of our country with some concern. Was the Revolution justified? There was not agreement among Christians\u2014then or now. Not all the actions of the colonists can be lumped together into a category of \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong.\u201d There was mob violence in some areas that was clearly sinful disobedience. In other places there were well-established and recognized colonial governments that objected to what they saw as illegitimate interference in their jurisdiction. It is well documented that Lutherans who lived in this country at that time were divided in their loyalties.\nIn Romans 13, the apostle Paul was not qualifying the type of government God wants us to obey. When Paul wrote of being \u201csubject to the governing authorities\u201d (verse 1), and when the apostle Peter wrote of submitting to and honoring the emperor (1 Peter 2), Nero was emperor. He was definitely no friend of Christians; his atrocities against them are well documented. Yet, the directives of \u201cbe subject\u201d and \u201chonor\u201d applied even to him\u2014not because his life or actions generated respect, but because he filled a seat of authority God had established.\nPaul\u2019s point in the verse you cited is that God\u2019s design for governmental authorities is that they punish those who break laws and protect those who keep laws. When citizens abide by the laws of the land, there is no need to fear governmental authorities. For example, if people have not broken any laws, there is no need to be afraid of a passing police car as they walk down a sidewalk.\u00a0 On the other hand, those who are lawbreakers have reason to fear governmental authorities.\nGod\u2019s fourth commandment speaks of his representatives in government, in the church and in the home. Not all those who represent God in those three areas do so in ways that God wants. Still, God instructs people to honor and obey his representatives, unless they command a course of action that is contrary to what God says in his word (Acts 5:29). I hope this provides some help."}
{"prompt": "God and evil", "completion": "A friend says he doesn't and can't believe in God.  His reasoning is a paradox - \"If God created everything in the world, and he is only good, where did 'evil' come from and the fallen angels, i.e. Satan?  God must have created 'evil', or, God doesn't exist.\"  I must say his argument is compelling for a weak believer or an unbeliever.  In fact, I've seen others accept his argument and reject God's word.\n\n\nThe Bible tells us that \u201cIn the beginning God created the heavens and the earth\u201d (Genesis 1:1). \u201cIn six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them\u201d (Exodus 20:11). At the end of the sixth day of creation, God pronounced everything \u201cvery good\u201d (Genesis 1:31). All was perfect in God\u2019s creation. Sin was absent.\nAt some point thereafter, angels rebelled against God and were cast into hell (2 Peter 2:4). Through Satan\u2019s temptation in the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve sinned against God (Genesis 3). Sin clearly came into the world through people\u2019s actions (Romans 5:12). God is removed from wrongdoing of any kind; he is holy (James 1:13; Exodus 15:11; Isaiah 6:3).\nGod certainly knew that sin would infect and corrupt his creation. God certainly had the power to prevent sin from entering the perfect world he created, but the Bible does not tell us why God allowed sin to take place.\nQuestions about God and why he does or does not do something about evil need to be addressed in light of passages like these: \u201cOh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out! \u2018Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?\u2019 \u2018Who has ever given to God, that God should repay them?\u2019 For from him and through him and for him are all things. To him be the glory forever! Amen.\u201d (Romans 11:33-36) \u201c\u2019For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,\u2019\u201d declares the LORD. \u2018\u201cAs the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.\u2019\u201d (Isaiah 55:8-9) God always acts wisely, and his wisdom far surpasses our understanding. God\u2019s ways may be mysterious to us, but his ways are always right. Christian faith recognizes and accepts that.\nWe really aren\u2019t to be surprised if we can\u2019t understand God completely. What we do know with certainty is that God met evil head-on at Calvary. The cross of Christ shows us God\u2019s power over sin and his compassionate love for a world lost in sin. At the cross of Christ God\u2019s justice and love intersect.\nCan you prove any of these things to your friend and change that person\u2019s thinking? No. But you can continue to share God\u2019s word with your friend, because God can change hearts and lives through his powerful gospel (Romans 1:16; 10:17). I encourage you to keep doing that."}

The oath of doing one\u2019s duty to God\u2014however God is defined\u2014remains. In fact, recently-updated Scouting requirements place even more emphasis on the oath. The FAQ available through this link explains that emphasis.\nThe Scouting oath is a first commandment issue. The oath conflicts with the promises Lutherans make on their confirmation day. As Lutheran Christians, we desire to testify by our words and actions that there is only one true God (Isaiah 45:21; 1 Corinthians 8:4) and there is only one Savior from sin: Jesus Christ (John 14:6).\nAny changes in our practice would begin with the Conference of Presidents appointing a committee to examine Scouting requirements."}
{"prompt": "Time of Grace ministry", "completion": "Is Time of Grace WELS or parasynodical? \n\n\nIt is a parasynodical organization. That terminology describes organizations and ministries that do not receive funding from WELS\u2019 ministry financial plan (budget) but are in doctrinal fellowship with WELS.

There is a WELS church where I am moving to, so why do I get the feeling from others that I am doing something wrong?\n\n\nThere is certainly nothing wrong with wanting to be closer to your children, so there is no need for you to feel guilty about leaving your current congregation and transferring to another one of our churches.\nIn addition, there is no reason for others to put you on a guilt trip about relocating. If others have differing thoughts on your potential move, speak to them kindly and offer explanation as you like.\nGod bless you!"}
{"prompt": "Using lectionaries", "completion": "The lectionaries used in Lutheran churches don\u2019t cover the whole Bible, not even the New Testament. Doesn't this contradict the instruction to preach God\u2019s whole counsel if so many Bible passages are never preached on?\n\n\nIf Lutheran Churches follow the ILCW three-year lectionary series, they will offer readings from 57 of the Bible\u2019s 66 books. That is a good amount of variety. Of course, when pastors preach on one of the readings, they will very likely refer to or quote other sections of Scripture. That means that worshipers will be on the receiving end of even more portions of Scripture than the readings themselves.\nI am not aware of any lectionaries that cover the whole Bible (all the chapters). And that is really not the point of the Scripture passage to which you allude. In Acts 20:27 the apostle Paul told the Ephesian elders, \u201cFor I have not hesitated to proclaim to you the whole will of God.\u201d The King James Version had translated that verse as: \u201cFor I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.\u201d\nThe point the apostle Paul was making was that he had taught God\u2019s revealed will, his will as revealed in Scripture, to those Christians. He did not cover up or hide any truths of Scripture. That does not mean he read the entire Old Testament to them.\nSo, using a lectionary does not in any way contradict what we find in Acts 20:27. There would be something wrong if our pastors were holding back from teaching what God\u2019s word says. That is not the case. They are proclaiming the whole will of God."}
{"prompt": "The Bible and tattoos", "completion": "What does the Bible teach about tattoos?  A friend quoted Leviticus 19:28.  Said the Nazi's used this as a reason to tattoo Jews since it was forbidden by God. Thus, Christians should not get tattoos.  I said it was part of the Levitical laws pertaining to the Israelites and does not apply to New Testament Christians.  The person was stunned that parts of the Bible no longer apply to us; felt strongly that all of Scripture applies to us.  \n\n\nAs it turns out, the March 2017 \u201cLight for our path\u201d column in Forward in Christ will address a very similar question. So as not to provide a spoiler, I will pass along a brief response in this forum.\nYou are correct in noting that the instruction in Leviticus no longer applies to New Testament Christians. The prohibition of tattoos is part of God\u2019s instruction to the people of Israel as they traveled to the promised land of Canaan. Because heathen Canaanite customs included tattoos, God instructed his people to avoid practices that would have identified them as followers of false gods. As that prohibition is limited to Leviticus, God\u2019s directive involved only the Israelites and targeted the first commandment, not the fifth commandment, which concerns the care of our bodies.\nIf your friend was stunned to hear that parts of the Bible no longer apply to us and believes that all of Scripture applies to Christians today, I have to wonder\u2014in all seriousness\u2014if your friend offers animal sacrifices (Leviticus 2-7); celebrates the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Harvest and the Feast of Ingathering (Exodus 23); observes the Year of Jubilee (Leviticus 25); destroys a place of residence because of persistent mildew (Leviticus 14); or, a host of other Old Testament instructions.\nYour friend will want to understand and recognize that Christians today are not bound to Old Testament civil and ceremonial laws. God\u2019s moral law remains. The Ten Commandments serve as a good summary of the moral law.\nBeyond this, the upcoming column in Forward in Christ will address the application of Christian freedom and tattoos."}
{"prompt": "All-important Christian doctrines", "completion": "I know that every doctrine in the Bible is important because all come from God. My question is, what doctrines must a person believe to be considered Christian? (For example, there will be Catholics in heaven who died trusting in Christ as their Savior, while there will not be Mormons in heaven since their doctrines involving Christ are not scriptural.) Is there a \"key doctrine list\" somewhere?\n\n\nThe apostle Paul\u2019s answer to the jailer of Philippi\u2019s question highlights a doctrine that is absolutely essential for salvation: \u201cBelieve in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved\u201d (Acts 16:31). Faith in Jesus Christ as Savior\u2014justification through faith alone, by grace alone\u2014is necessary for salvation. Saving Christian faith recognizes Jesus Christ as the Son of God, the second person of the Trinity. For this reason, the Athanasian Creed states that the doctrine of the Trinity and the doctrine of Jesus are essential for salvation.\nAs you indicated, all doctrines of the Bible are important. Because Christian doctrines are not isolated and stand-alone teachings, a denial of one doctrine has the potential of leading to the denial of more and more doctrines, and eventually threatening saving faith. This is why we seek to remain firmly grounded in God\u2019s word always (Ephesians 3:14-19)."}
{"prompt": "Christian bakery news story", "completion": "Recently there was a news story about a bakery owned by Christians taken to court because they would not provide service for a wedding cake to a gay couple getting married. While every situation might be different, I was curious if that is how a Christian should behave. Didn't they miss out on an opportunity to show Christian love and speak truth while still providing a service? You wouldn't know someone is gay when it's a birthday cake. Aren't we supposed to love our neighbor? What is the correct biblical approach to social issues like these?\n\n\nChristians do want to \u201cspeak the truth in love\u201d (Ephesians 4:15) on all occasions. The truth Christians speak might contain a message of law. The truth Christians speak might contain a message of gospel. When it comes to marriage, Christians lovingly share the biblical truth that God designed marriage to be the union of one man and one woman (Genesis 2:22-24; Matthew 19:5-6; Romans 7:2).\nWhen Christians operate businesses, they interact with and provide services for many different people. Their transactions with non-Christian churches are not endorsements of those churches\u2019 doctrines. When they sell their products to individuals who self-identify with unscriptural practices or ways of living, they are not approving or sanctioning the actions of those individuals. If that were the case, then Christian bakers would need potential customers to fill out an application form so they would not be guilty of sanctioning heterosexual couples living together before marriage or unscriptural divorces by making cakes for weddings involving those people.\nCertainly a Christian will want to consider the role of conscience in this regard. If a Christian\u2019s conscience says that it would be sinful to provide a wedding cake for a same-sex wedding, the Christian will want to refrain from sinning against his or her conscience (Romans 14:23). At the same time, that Christian will want to be aware of the potential legal liabilities that may result from withholding services from a customer.\n1 Corinthians 5:12-13 is helpful in providing direction for Christians\u2019 interactions with unbelievers: \u201cWhat business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside? God will judge those outside.\u201d Those words come in the context of the apostle Paul directing the Christians in Corinth to take action with a church member who was impenitent over an incestuous relationship. The apostle instructed the Corinthians to do what Jesus said in Matthew 18: \u201cIf your brother or sister sins\u2026\u201d Church discipline involves those who profess to be within the church. We have no specific instructions from God on addressing personal sins in the lives of those outside the church.\nCertainly, those words from 1 Corinthians 5 do not mean that we close our eyes and ears to what is going on in the world. What those words do mean is that the church does not have the responsibility or divine mandate to discipline people who are not part of the church.\nSo, where does this leave us? Yes, we want to love our neighbor, but because there is no manual that spells out in detail how best to live a life of neighborly love, Christians will wrestle with decisions in the questions you asked. They will seek to arrive at decisions that agree with biblical principles and that do not violate consciences. They will also seek to refrain from judging the motives of fellow Christians who arrive at different decisions."}
{"prompt": "Inheritance and adult child", "completion": "Is it wrong to disinherit an adult child that is living in open and unrepented sin and you know that the money would be used for sinful habits?  God says that we need to be good stewards and leave an inheritance for our children.  Would it not be better to leave that money to a church or another area that would help the spreading of the gospel?\n\n\nIn the Bible God has not specified precisely how we are to distribute, at death, the possessions he has entrusted to us. He allows us to make those decisions in Christian love and wisdom.\nIf you are of the opinion that it would not be beneficial or helpful for an adult child to receive money through your inheritance, then your thought of redirecting your assets elsewhere is understandable. There is nothing unscriptural about that intended course of action.\nEven though I do not know your situation, I would encourage repeated efforts to address and try to resolve the obstacles that have you thinking of disinheriting your child. If you follow through on that plan, ill will in family relations could very likely result. Clear communication with your child will be most helpful\u2014for the present and the future.\nIf you are in need of resources for estate planning, WELS Ministry of Christian Giving offers an estate planning guide. This link will take you to that guide. God bless you and your family."}
{"prompt": "The Ten Commandments and Christians", "completion": "What is the role of the 10 Commandments for WELS Lutherans? For New Testament Christians? Does the WELS agree with Paul?\r\n \n\n\nA starting point to your questions is that the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20; Deuteronomy 5) are part of the Mosaic Law that God gave to his Old Testament people of Israel. The Mosaic Law had limited purpose and duration. Its obligations ended when Jesus Christ came into our world as the fulfilment of all the prophecies of the Messiah.\nWe can see from the Mosaic Law wording of the third commandment (\u201cSabbath day\u201d) and the fourth commandment (reference to the Promised Land) that not all the content of the Ten Commandments applies to New Testament followers of the Lord.\nSo, how do Christians view the Ten Commandments? We rightly regard them as a summary of God\u2019s moral law: his will for all people of all time. We do see Jesus (Luke 18:20) and the apostle Paul (Romans 13:9) restating some of the commandments in a different order from the Old Testament listing. (I am thinking this was your reference to the apostle Paul.) Presenting the commandments in that way illustrates how we, as New Testament Christians, are free from the Mosaic Law wording of the Ten Commandments and yet look to the Ten Commandments as a summary of God\u2019s will for our lives.\nAs a mirror, the Ten Commandments show us God\u2019s demands for holy living and our failure to live up to those demands. As a rule or guide, the Ten Commandments lay out for us tangible ways in which we can express our gratitude to God for our forgiveness of sins. Jesus kept the law perfectly for us (Romans 5:19; 10:4; Galatians 4:4-5) and paid the penalty we deserved for not keeping God\u2019s law perfectly (Isaiah 53:6; Galatians 3:13; 1 Peter 2:24).\n\u201cFor the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ\u201d (John 1:17)."}
{"prompt": "Free will", "completion": "I was (am) of the belief that Adam (Eve) was the only one with the option of free will.  I was told recently that once a person comes to faith they now have free will.  Is that true?\n\n\nEver since the fall into sin in Eden, the free will that people have is limited to making decisions about their earthly lives. So, people choose to marry or remain single, enter into this or that vocation, live in a certain area, etc. Of course, when it comes to making decisions like those, people may not always be able to follow through on what they would like to see happen in their lives.\nAfter the fall into sin, people by nature can choose only evil in the spiritual realm. \u201cThe sinful mind is hostile to God. It does not submit to God\u2019s law, nor can it do so\u201d (Romans 8:7). The inclination of the heart is only evil by nature (Genesis 6:5; 8:21). This certainly means that no one can choose to believe in God. Romans 8:7 explains that people do not want anything to do with God in the first place. Then, when we add passages like 1 Corinthians 2:14, Ephesians 2:1 and Colossians 2:13, we understand that even if we wanted to choose to believe in Jesus we could not do that because we were spiritually blind and dead by nature. All we could do was sin and reject God.\nThanks be to God that he sent his Holy Spirit into our hearts to join us to Jesus so we could personally enjoy the forgiveness of sins he won for all people. As Christians we now have a new self that desires to live life God\u2019s way (Ephesians 4:24). As a child of God, my will is much different than before my conversion. Now my new self wants to use the means of grace to strengthen my faith; now I want to follow God\u2019s law as a tangible way of showing my thankfulness to him for my salvation in Jesus his Son. However, even when I, as a child of God, want to do those things in life that are good and godly, I recognize that it is God working in me: \u201cIt is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose\u201d (Philippians 2:13)."}
{"prompt": "Anointing with oil", "completion": "Do we ever anoint with oil a person who is sick or use anointing with oil at any other time? If so what kind of oil? I am thinking of verses like James 5:13-15, Mark 6:13.\n\n\nWe have no command from the Lord to anoint individuals today with oil. In biblical accounts, anointing people with oil was done for ceremonial or sacred purposes (anointing prophets, priests and kings into offices), and for soothing or medicinal purposes (Ecclesiastes 9:8; Luke 10:34).\nThe original Greek of the New Testament has two words that mean \u201canoint.\u201d One described the ceremonial application, another spoke of a medicinal usage. The passages that you cited contain the verbs that speak of a medicinal usage."}

{"prompt": "The serpent in Genesis 3", "completion": "I am following Billy Graham's \"Hope for Each Day\" Bible reading schedule. One of the first readings was the account of the fall in the Garden of Eden. In the NIV it states the serpent was more crafty than the other animals and that he spoke to Eve. How does this become \"the devil tempted Eve\"? Nowhere does it say the devil was behind this temptation, at least in Genesis. Thanks.\n\n\nYou are correct in noting that Moses, in Genesis, does not specifically identify the serpent as Satan. Other parts of Scripture provide clear identification of the creature who spoke to Eve.\nJohn 8:44 \u2013 \u201cYou belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father\u2019s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.\u201d\nRevelation 12:9 \u2013 \u201cThe great dragon was hurled down\u2014that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray.

He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil, or Satan, and bound him for a thousand years.\u201d\nWhat is clear in Genesis is that the woman\u2019s seed would crush the head of serpent (3:15).

{"prompt": "Old Testament polygamous marriages", "completion": "God's design for marriage has always been between one man and one woman right from Genesis. When many of the Israelites started having polygamous marriages, why didn't God speak out against that sin,  and lead them to repentance? \n\n\nIn the Bible God does not always explain his actions or his inaction. Nor does he have to. Job learned that lesson the hard way. When the Bible narrates events and people\u2019s actions, it does not always do so with commentary on the morality or immorality of the people involved. Sometimes, the reader is left to evaluate the actions using other parts of Scripture.\nWhen it comes to God\u2019s design for marriage, it is clear that marriage is to be the lifelong union of one man and one woman (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4-6; Romans 7:2-3; 1 Corinthians 7:2; 1 Timothy 3:2; and, Titus 1:6). While not necessarily providing commentary when individuals went beyond that design, the troubles and unhappy home life that resulted from polygamous marriages illustrate the truth: God\u2019s ways are wise and God\u2019s will is the route to happiness in our lives."}
{"prompt": "Alcohol consumption", "completion": "My question deals with the consumption of alcohol.  I believe drinking is ok if done responsibly, but my friend believes any alcohol consumption is a sin.  The friend believes that the word \"wine\" in the Bible has different meanings such as to be happy or joyful.  The friend always uses the example that God would never say a little viewing of pornography is fine, just don't overdo it.  He takes the case that the over- consumption of alcohol can lead to sinful acts.  He also believes that Jesus wouldn't had wine at the Lord's Supper only juice.  How do you address this train of thought?\n\n\nI would encourage your friend to focus on clear passages of Scripture. The Bible does not condemn the use of alcohol (Psalm 104:14-15; 1 Timothy 5:23). It condemns the abuse of alcohol (Romans 13:13; 1 Corinthians 6:10; Ephesians 5:18). If wine itself were sinful, Jesus would certainly not have miraculously changed water into wine at the wedding at Cana (John 2:1-11). Under the Old Testament ceremonial laws, God even commanded the use of wine with offerings (Exodus 29:40; Number 28:7).\u00a0 Think of the implications of that.\nIn biblical days in Palestine, people regularly mixed wine with water to purify the water. We know from history that wine was part of the celebration of the Passover meal. Since the institution of the Lord\u2019s Supper took place during the celebration of the Passover meal, the \u201cfruit of the vine\u201d (Matthew 26:29) was a part of it. Any grapes that had been harvested in the previous fall and pressed into juice would most likely have been going through the fermentation process in the following spring (when Jesus instituted the Lord\u2019s Supper).\nWhat your friend says about pornography is true: God does not approve of that in large or small amounts. Equating the moderate consumption of alcohol to pornography is where your friend\u2019s argument collapses. Nowhere does the Bible say that any alcohol consumption is a sin. Christians are free not to consume alcohol or to consume it in moderation. They are not free to bind the consciences of others with their opinions.\nRef.

{"prompt": "End times activities", "completion": "I have often wondered if our position that the pope is the Antichrist (which I believe of course) is subject to a fuller expression close to the end of time. What do you make of the claims that there will be a one world government, one world religion and coming \"Great Deception\" that could facilitate this one world religion? I accept the WELS position of amillennialism, but I do see trends in the world that are moving toward globalism, the ecumenicalism that is so rampant, and the talk I hear in the media and conspiracy groups who believe that people could eventually be implanted with micro-chips in the hand and forehead.  From a confessional Lutheran perspective, how should I view these events in our world? Will the work of the Antichrist intensify at the end, and what is \"Satan's Little Season\" and what do we make of this talk of one world government, religion etc? Is that taught in the Book of Revelation?  Thank you. \n\n\nScripture speaks of \u201cantichrists\u201d (1 John 2:18) and a great Antichrist (2 Thessalonians 2). The Antichrist whom Paul describes is not a world ruler but someone who \u201csets himself up in God\u2019s temple\u201d (2 Thessalonians 2:4); he is someone in the church.\nWhen it comes to conditions in the world, as we live in the \u201clast days\u201d (Hebrews 1:2), Scripture paints a picture of \u201cterrible times\u201d (2 Timothy 3:1-9). Jesus spoke of calamities that would take place (Matthew 24:4-13). He even asked the haunting question, \u201cWhen the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?\u201d (Luke 18:8)\nRevelation 20:7-10 describes Satan\u2019s final, futile effort to overthrow Jesus Christ and his church. In a time period shortly before the last day, God will allow Satan to have more freedom and flexibility to carry out his dastardly work. Satan will enlist the help of his followers in church and government as he mounts a final assault that will end disastrously for him and his followers.\nAre we living in that time period described in Revelation 20? God knows, but we do not know. In classes, I often answer that question with other questions: \u201cAs bad as it is right now, could things get worse? Could things get worse for Christians? Could things get worse for Christians in the United States?\u201d The answers are usually \u201cyes.\u201d Finally, we don\u2019t know where we are on God\u2019s timeline to Judgment Day.\nWhat we do know is that Jesus has defeated all our spiritual enemies\u2014sin, Satan, hell and death\u2014and through faith in him we are victorious over all those enemies."}

All I can do is point out personal observations. The translation in question is based on two faulty premises: that Jesus spoke only Aramaic during his earthly life and ministry, and that ancient Aramaic-based biblical manuscripts are the original texts of the New Testament.\nIn the first century A.D., it was common for Jews to speak Greek in public and Aramaic in their homes and in worship settings. It would not have been unusual for Jesus to follow that pattern. Additionally, Aramaic biblical manuscripts are translations of the original Greek New Testament manuscripts and are of a later date than the Greek manuscripts."}
{"prompt": "Praying to God alone", "completion": "Hello.  I just wanted to clarify something that I have been told about the churches in the Wisconsin Synod.

The Bible speaks of Jesus being our sole mediator (1 Timothy 2:5-6; 1 John 1:21) and intercessor (Hebrews 7:25). Nowhere does the Bible direct us to pray to followers of God who have died.

{"prompt": "Marking up our Bibles", "completion": "Is it OK to write in your Bible?\n\n\nThere is nothing wrong with that. In fact, annotating our Bibles can be helpful. Allow me to pass along these ideas from a former professor of mine:\n\u201cAnd as you read the Scriptures, keep a pen or pencil in your hand. For some reason or other, some people have a distaste for marking up their Bibles, but there is no reason why we ought not to underline the passages which have special meaning for us. Underlining them will help to fix them in our memory; it will enable us to find these passages with greater ease when we want to use them again, and they will be the passages that we remember and will want to find often, and sometimes in days of great trial and distress we may find great comfort just in reviewing some of these passages.\n\u201cBesides underlining such passages, we may want to underline significant words and phrases which will help us to recall the content of a certain chapter, or which mark the theme of the book, or which mark certain divisions of the book. For example, in one of my Bibles all the words which speak of the joy of the apostle and the people to whom he wrote are underlined in the epistle to the Philippians. In the epistles of John, the word \u2018love\u2019 is underlined. In the book of Job, the various speeches are indicated by underling the names of the speakers as they occur. You will be surprised how your familiarity with Scripture will grow as you make use of these devices.\n\u201cThere are also other ways of using a pen while we read. One of the Bibles that I use has an \u2018M\u2019 in the margin wherever a miracle is found, a \u2018P\u2019 next to every general prophecy, a cross next to every Messianic prophecy, and \u2018FP\u2019 wherever the fulfillment of a prophecy is referred to.\u201d\nIf you liked these ideas and want more, this link will take you to a paper that is available from the Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary Essay File:\u00a0 \u201cHow to Study Your Bible.\u201d"}

How is it that Satan or Adam and Eve were able to conceive of the idea to disobey God and sin if they were created perfectly?  Thank you!\n\n\nAdam and Eve did not conceive of the idea to disobey God and sin. That idea came from Satan. Sometime after God created everything, Satan and other angels rebelled against God (2 Peter 2:4; Jude 6). In the form of a serpent, Satan then tempted Eve. By giving in to temptation, sin entered the world.\u00a0 As perfect beings, those whom God created had the ability to sin.\nThe good news of the Bible is that Jesus Christ destroyed the works of the devil (1 John 3:8) by his holy life, innocent suffering and death, and glorious resurrection."}

I would like to know where in the Old Testament it instructs converts to the Jewish religion to be not only circumcised but to have to wash themselves.  Also, the specifications to the Mikveh and references to it. Also, the Tumah and Taharah, are they words in the OT?   \n\n\nYour search has been frustrating because there is no instruction in the Old Testament for \u201cconverts to the Jewish religion to be not only circumcised but to have to wash themselves.\u201d A ceremonial washing for Gentile converts originated with Jewish tradition and custom. The origin of that ceremonial washing is uncertain.

{"prompt": "WELS website contents", "completion": "When I scan your website, it seems to focus almost exclusively on \"WELS\" activities.  I almost never read or hear about what other Christians or even other Lutherans are doing to spread the gospel of Jesus.  Perhaps I'm over-analyzing things, but your website doesn't seem to rejoice in ministry outside of itself.  Is there a reason for this?\n\n\nIt is very common for a church and a church body to design a website that provides information about the congregation and the church body. Providing general religious news is not typically part of that purpose.\nWhile our website achieves the purpose of providing information about our church body, the most important information it shares with people concerns Jesus Christ. The website seeks to connect people with Christ. For that reason, you will find many resources consisting of prayers, Bible studies, devotions, explanations of Christian beliefs, and even this question and answer forum.\nPlease do not misunderstand the contents of the website. We rejoice when God\u2019s word is spread. In one of the prayers in our hymnal, Christian Worship, we pray: \u201cWherever your word is proclaimed, O Lord, grant it success. Let your kingdom come to us and others, so that we and many more might join the assembly of saints and angels to sing your praise forever.\u201d We acknowledge and confess \u201cthe holy Christian Church, the communion of saints.\u201d We confess that the Christian Church consists of people everywhere who trust in Jesus Christ as their Savior from sin.\nSo, with that explanation in mind, do explore more of our website!"}
{"prompt": "Meaning of 2 Corinthians 5", "completion": "I am wondering if you would explain the meaning of 2 Corinthians 5:6-8. I am very confused by it.\n\n\n\u201cTherefore we are always confident and know that as long as we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord. For we live by faith, not by sight. We are confident, I say, and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord\u201d (2 Corinthians 5:6-8).\nThe apostle Paul\u2019s words tell us that there is something unique about people: they have bodies and souls. We see that when Paul speaks about wanting \u201cto be away from the body and at home with the Lord.\u201d But there is more to Paul\u2019s words than that. In the apostle\u2019s words we also see his longing for heaven.\nWhen death takes place, the body and soul separate. The body remains on earth and, for the Christian, the soul goes to God\u2019s presence in heaven. When Paul wrote that he longed \u201cto be away from the body and at home with the Lord,\u201d he meant that he looked forward to the time when the Lord would call him home. But, until that time, he was going to use his life to serve the Lord by serving others.\nPaul speaks for us, doesn\u2019t he? We sing in one of our hymns: \u201cI\u2019m but a stranger here; Heav\u2019n is my home\u201d (Christian Worship 417:1). We too recognize that, as Christians, our real home is with God. Death for the Christian, then, is a homecoming; it\u2019s the arrival of the Christian\u2019s soul in God\u2019s presence in heaven.\nOn the last day God will reunite bodies and souls, glorify the bodies of Christians, and we will be with the Lord forever.\u00a0 Praise God for that."}
{"prompt": "Baptism sponsors", "completion": "My wife and I are Catholic.  My wife was raised WELS, so we both have a strong appreciation for the WELS and how strongly they hold their beliefs.  My wife's brother and wife just had a baby.  They are having a non-WELS baptism sponsor and are also having my wife's sister be the other baptism sponsor.  My wife's sister has never renounced her WELS membership, but she is not an active member and goes to a Missouri Synod church with her husband and children.  My question is: what denomination do the baptism sponsors need to be?  My wife's sister does not live around here, so we are sure the pastor in the WELS church is not aware she attends and worships at the Missouri Synod church.  As a Catholic, my wife and I take baptism sponsors very seriously as they are there to witness and guide.  We also take doctrine seriously and we wonder if we should tell pastor about this as to not be making a mockery of the baptism in the WELS church.\r\n\r\nThank your for your time and we look forward to your response.  \n\n\nA starting point in my response is that we recognize that the formal use of sponsors is a church custom. God has neither commanded nor forbidden the practice. In Christian freedom, the practice of sponsors may or may not be utilized.\nOlder liturgies of Holy Baptism in our churches differentiated between witnesses and sponsors. Anyone could serve as a witness to the baptism. It was different with sponsors. Since sponsors promised to remember the baptized child in prayer, remind the child of his/her baptism, and offer counsel and assistance in seeing that the child was brought up in the Christian faith, in accordance with the teachings of the Lutheran Church (especially if the child\u2019s parents died), individuals who served as sponsors were to be of the same faith and fellowship. That practice had concern that people not make promises that went against their consciences or religious convictions.\nThe baptism liturgy in Christian Worship, the hymnal used in most WELS congregations, does not differentiate between witnesses or sponsors. It does not ask questions of people who are standing up with the parents. Instead, the baptism liturgy asks the members of the congregation if they are willing to assist the parents in bringing up the child in the Christian faith. In a sense, there is a congregation of sponsors for the baptized child. It is possible that the WELS congregation you have in mind uses a different liturgy for Holy Baptism, but if it uses the one in our hymnal, there is not a recognition of sponsors. The individuals standing up with the parents are regarded as witnesses.\nWhat this means is that parents, on their own, apart from the baptism liturgy, are free to give titles and corresponding responsibilities to those individuals who stand up with them for the baptism of their child. If they want people to serve as sponsors or godparents, they will want to communicate to the individuals involved exactly what that means. If there are thoughts of sponsors taking over the religious training of the child in the event of the death of the parents, that will need to be communicated in a legal document. If parents want individuals to serve as sponsors, they will want to take into account the stated faith of the individuals\u2014especially the confession of faith made by their church membership\u2014so as not to put people in compromising situations.\nThe membership of your wife\u2019s sister is another matter. Hopefully, there will be communication between her and her WELS pastor so that there can be consistency in her church membership and the church where she worships."}
{"prompt": "Changes in church", "completion": "I have been WELS most of my life.  Over the last three years, I have seen WELS churches not only change the liturgy and the creeds but even the Lord\u2019s Prayer.  Since the Lord's Prayer came from the mouth of Jesus himself, how do WELS pastors feel they can change those words?\r\nAlso, the benediction, as spoken now, takes away from the majesty of God's house.  \u201cLook upon you with favor\" does not carry the same impact of \"May the Lord lift up his countenance upon you.\u201d \r\nI also learned from a synod convention a few years ago that a decision was made to allow pastors to use three different Bible translations to pick and choose from to use as their resource(s) for their sermons, etc. \r\nI have found that I may move to a city where a church uses the old blue hymnal and the KJV, both original and new versions as their only Bibles.  Also, they use the \"Thee, Thy, and Thou\" as written.  The changes in WELS have made me sad.\r\n\n\n\nThe items that you listed\u2014that sadden you\u2014are called adiaphora. That word (adiaphoron, singular) describes matters that God has neither commanded nor forbidden.\nGod has not prescribed a specific way of worshiping him as a family of believers. He leaves that to our Christian freedom and judgment. Yes, Jesus spoke the Lord\u2019s Prayer, but we have to translate his words from Greek into English. There are many ways of putting the Greek words into English.\nWhen it comes to \u201cThee, Thy and Thou\u201d in the King James Version (KJV), those words reflect Elizabethan English usage of pronouns. And so in the KJV we find Jesus addressing Pontius Pilate with \u201cThou\u201d (John 19:11). God even addressed Satan in the Garden of Eden with \u201cthee\u201d (Genesis 3:15). Because we do not speak as the translators of the KJV did in 1611, it is appropriate and useful for our Bible translations to read as we speak today. The original languages of the Bible do not have special pronouns to give reverence to God. It is the nouns, the names and titles of God, that engender our respect.\nIn a similar way, one wonders how many people know what \u201ccountenance\u201d is and what it means for the Lord to \u201clift up\u201d his countenance toward them. Hearing that the Lord \u201clooks on you with favor,\u201d and does not turn his back on you because of your sins, can bring home the intended meaning of that part of the benediction.\nIn the recent past, synod conventions addressed the subject of what Bible translations to use for our synodical publishing purposes. Congregations and their pastors have been, and are, free to use Bible translations of their choosing.\nThe changes you have cited are not doctrinal; they are matters in the realm of our Christian freedom. I would encourage you to recognize the difference and put changes like these in perspective. Forms of worship are helpful, but we do not want to let them become more important than the content of our worship: praising a merciful and forgiving God (Psalm 103)."}

The wife does not have authority over her own body but yields it to her husband. In the same way, the husband does not have authority over his own body but yields it to his wife. Do not deprive each other except perhaps by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control\u201d (1 Corinthians 7:3-5).\u00a0 This last section would especially have application if the sleeping arrangements you described are frequent.\nRelocating to a different part of the house may temporarily suspend the arguments, but it is honest conversation between husband and wife that will lead to resolution. Continue to do what you can to encourage these people to communicate in their marriage. A suggestion to consider marriage counseling would also have their best interests in mind. God bless your Christian concern."}
{"prompt": "Social justice and liberalism", "completion": "How does the WELS view the modern social justice movement, and is being liberal compatible with the teachings of the Synod?\n\n\n\u201cSocial justice\u201d can mean different things to different people. If the term means to treat people equally and without prejudice, we are all for it. Often, the term can be associated with the social gospel, which emphasizes the idea that it is the church\u2019s responsibility to reform society. We do not endorse that idea. In This We Believe, a statement of belief of our church body, we explain the role of the church and the role of the state.\n\u201cWe believe that God has given the church and the state their own distinct responsibilities. To the church the Lord has assigned the responsibility of calling sinners to repentance, of proclaiming forgiveness through the cross of Christ, and of encouraging the believers in their Christian living. The purpose is to lead the elect of God to eternal salvation through faith in Christ. To the state the Lord has assigned the duty of keeping good order and peace, of punishing the wrongdoer, and of arranging all civil matters in society (Romans 13:3,4). The purpose is \u2018that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness\u2019 (1 Timothy 2:2).\n\u201cWe believe that the proper relation is preserved between the church and the state only when each remains within its divinely assigned sphere and uses its divinely entrusted means.\u201d You can find the quotations in context via this link.\nWhen it comes to your question of being \u201cliberal,\u201d I do not know if you mean that in the context of politics or religion; that term also is subject to different shadings of meaning. In general, Christians will want their political views to line up with the convictions of their faith. In the context of religion, \u201cliberal\u201d usually describes views that depart from biblical teachings. Such views are not compatible with the teachings of our church body."}

The Jews, going back to at least the third century B.C., substituted \u201cAdonai\u201d (\u201cLORD\u201d) for Yahweh. Respect for God led the Jews not to pronounce \u201cYahweh\u201d or \u201cYahveh.\u201d Because of that, we do not know with certainty what vowels were tied to the four consonants of that name.

How it is decided hermeneutically which details are included in the meaning of a word?\n\n\n\u201cDo this in remembrance of me\u201d (Luke 22:19) means that we \u201ccall to mind\u201d and \u201crecount\u201d the high price of our salvation when we partake of the Lord\u2019s Supper. Jesus offered up his body in death (Colossians 1:22; Hebrews 10:10; 1 Peter 2:24) and shed his blood (John 19:34; Romans 3:25; Colossians 1:20) to take away our sins. The Lord gives us his very body and blood in his holy Supper.\nAs we receive the Lord\u2019s body and blood in, with, and under the bread and wine (1 Corinthians 10:16), we remember the high cost of the forgiveness of sins that we receive through this holy meal. More than being merely a memorial meal, the Lord\u2019s Supper offers and gives us life and salvation.\nEtymology can sometimes be helpful in arriving at the meaning of a word, but what best determines the meaning of a word is how the word is used.

I assume heresy, moral turpitude, and incorrectly dividing the word of truth apply. Anything else?\r\n\n\n\nYou have highlighted the main issues. Persistent false doctrine, immoral and criminal behavior, unfaithfulness and incompetence are issues that can lead to the termination of a pastor\u2019s call.\n1 Timothy 3:1-7 and Titus 1:6-9 lay out qualifications for service in the public ministry.

I am not alone in teaching and preaching from these books, and encouraging fellow Christians to read James and Revelation. The pastors, teachers, staff ministers and professors of our church body encourage God\u2019s people to read all of Scripture, including James and Revelation.\nThe stories you have heard are false.

{"prompt": "Prayer fellowship", "completion": "Is it ever okay to pray with a non-WELS Christian?  I have heard some say that it is not because the WELS is the only true church.  I have heard others say that in personal situations, it is up to your own discretion.  I would like to know if a Christian friend in college and I can say a prayer of thanksgiving before we eat. Thanks.\n\n\nThe reason for refraining from praying with people who are outside of our fellowship is not because we do not consider them Christians. We do not pretend to be the only church whose teachings are entirely biblical; the kingdom of\u00a0 God is not limited to WELS. We believe we are holding to the truths of God\u2019s word. If others accuse us of error in doctrine or practice, we are certainly willing and interested to listen, and see what Scripture says about their claims and our confession.\nThe reason for not praying with people who are outside of our fellowship is because Scripture teaches us to work for and preserve the unity of faith (Ephesians 4:3), and not to pretend there is unity when there is not (Romans 16:17; 2 John 10;11).\nThe Bible does not speak of prayer fellowship any differently than other forms of fellowship like worship and joint gospel work. Not praying with your friend can be a good testimony to the truths of God\u2019s word and, perhaps, lead to a meaningful discussion of what the Bible teaches about fellowship principles."}
{"prompt": "The language of Scripture", "completion": "Last night, I was talking to an LCMS pastor. I learned that he believes we can't insist on a 6-day, 24-hour creation, because that would require us to hold that the bread and wine used in Communion are literally Jesus' body and blood. What's your take? Thank you.\n\n\nThe language of Scripture is that the days of creation were days as we know them\u2014with \u201cevening\u201d and \u201cmorning\u201d (Genesis 1-2; Exodus 20:11). There is nothing in Scripture to suggest any meaning other than 24-hour days.\nIn the Lord\u2019s Supper, Jesus gives us his very body and blood in, with and under the bread and wine for the forgiveness of sins (Matthew 26:26-28; 1 Corinthians 10:16; 11:27).

{"prompt": "Attitudes toward pastors", "completion": "Our former pastor was well respected and recently passed away. His replacement is not very well liked. Several of us are considering moving on. Would it be wrong to leave the congregation?\n\n\nI would encourage you and your fellow members to read the first four chapters of 1 Corinthians. In that part of the epistle, you will find that the Christians in Corinth were putting too much emphasis on their spiritual leaders. They were taking sides and rallying around their spiritual leaders\u2014past and present.\nWhat is interesting is seeing how the apostle Paul addressed that situation. He told the Corinthians to keep their spiritual leaders, including himself, in perspective. He reminded them that their leaders, their pastors, were only God\u2019s instruments to plant the seed of God\u2019s word and water it (1 Corinthians 3:5-9); they were servants of God (1 Corinthians 4:1). None of them were foundations of their faith (1 Corinthians 1:13). Paul wanted the Corinthians to see beyond the messengers of the word and focus on Jesus Christ. That would be my encouragement to you and your friends.\nThe Bible directs us to respect ministers of the gospel (Hebrews 13:7, 17). If your current pastor is faithfully carrying out his God-given responsibilities, he is worthy of your respect and honor (1 Timothy 5:17). The fact that he might not, in some people\u2019s eyes, measure up to his predecessor, does not provide reason for withholding respect and honor. It also does not provide legitimate reasons for leaving the congregation.\nWith the context of 1 Corinthians 1-4 in mind, it is understandable that Christians can become closer to some pastors who minister to them more than others. Christians might really appreciate a pastor who baptized them, another who confirmed them, still another who married them, and finally another who served a family member in illness and at death. It is wonderful that Christians appreciate faithful service by a faithful servant. But, as with the Corinthians, there is a problem if we put too much emphasis on the messengers of God\u2019s word and fail to put the focus on the content of their message: Jesus Christ, our Savior from sin.\nIf you and your friends, for whatever reason, do not like the messenger of the word who is serving you, I hope you can see the need to speak to your pastor and relay any concerns you may have. Nothing is resolved, and the eighth commandment is abused, if people merely talk about their pastor. On the other hand, good things can happen when people have difficult conversations and \u201cspeak the truth in love\u201d (Ephesians 4:15). Another \u201cspeaking\u201d you can do is to continue to pray for your pastor. God bless you and your congregation with unity and peace (Ephesians 4:3)."}
{"prompt": "Novena", "completion": "What does it mean to pray nine times a day?\n\n\nIt sounds like you might be asking about something called a \u201cnovena.\u201d The origin of the term is Latin for \u201cnine.\u201d\nNovena refers to the Roman Catholic practice of praying a prayer for nine days (or compressing the time frame to one day on which a prayer is prayed nine times). Such prayers are often addressed to the saints.\nThe Bible tells us to pray only to God, of course. And, while we are to be persistent in prayer (Matthew 7:7-11; Luke 18:1; 1 Thessalonians 5:17), Jesus tells us not to think that the wordiness of our prayers is going to impress him (Matthew 6:7-8). As Christians, we want to remember that prayer is powerful (James 5:16) because of the One receiving the prayers not the person praying."}

If you have not attended church for so long, why do you feel a need to have a WELS pastor officiate at your funeral?\nIf disabilities or other life circumstances prevent you from attending church, please contact one of our pastors. If members are not able to get to church, pastors will \u201cbring the church\u201d to them by delivering Word and sacrament in their homes or other facilities where they might be residing.\nIf you are able to attend church but just don\u2019t go, that\u2019s a different matter. The Bible says, \u201cAnd let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another\u2014and all the more as you see the Day approaching\u201d (Hebrews 10:24-25). God\u2019s will is that we worship him, hear his word, give him our prayers and praises, support kingdom work and receive the Lord\u2019s Supper.\nThe message of the Bible is this: \u201cI tell you, now is the time of God\u2019s favor, now is the day of salvation\u201d (2 Corinthians 6:2). Because the end of our earthly lives brings our time of grace to an end, Scripture urges us to address our relationship with God now. We do that through repentance and faith in Jesus Christ. Not knowing your specific situation, I pass along that same concern and encouragement."}
{"prompt": "Altar book", "completion": "What book is placed on the altar in WELS churches?\n\n\nIf congregations are using Christian Worship: A Lutheran Hymnal, it is likely that Christian Worship: Altar Book is the book you see on the altar. As there is no directive to use a certain book, pastors and their congregations enjoy freedom in this area."}
{"prompt": "Distinctively Lutheran", "completion": "There is a trend in the LCMS towards \"confessionalism,\" which promotes a high view of the Book of Concord (which is nothing new) and elaborate ceremonialism while denigrating contemporary worship.  It's also fashionable to ridicule the term \"Protestant,\" downplaying evangelism in favor of an inward focus on liturgy, and an embarrassed silence on the topic of \"the priesthood of all believers.\"  Churches that don't have Communion every Sunday, or embrace chasubles and genuflection, or aspire to purchase a censer are perceived as backwards, misguided, and \"Reformed.\"  Recent blog articles even question whether it is necessary to be \"distinctively Lutheran\" at all.  Is the WELS drifting in this direction as well?\n\n\nFrom my perspective, I am not able to point to any widespread trends. You will find diversity of worship styles in our congregations. That is an expression of Christian freedom. You can find contemporary worship in mission settings and well-established congregations. You can find traditional and blended worship in well-established congregations. Might individual pastors and lay people have preferences for worship styles? Certainly, but I am not in a position to state that the Synod is \u201cdrifting\u201d in any particular direction. I can say that we are not looking to hide our Lutheran identity."}
{"prompt": "Bringing Bibles to church", "completion": "I have not seen many people in the WELS bring their Bibles with them to church.  Does the WELS encourage people to bring their Bibles with them to church?\n\n\nNowadays, people might have their Bibles with them in ways you might not know: on their phones or other devices.\nWhen it comes to using Bibles in our worship services, there is generally not a great need for that. That is because the Scripture readings and sermon text are often printed for the worshiper (or there may be Bibles available in the pews or by chairs, or the words may be projected on a screen). In addition, the style of preaching that fits many of our pastors reduces the need for having Bibles. While pastors reference other parts of the Bible in their sermons, they often concentrate on the portion of Scripture that serves as the sermon text.\nFor reasons like these, there may not be a great deal of encouragement for worshipers to bring Bibles with them to church. There is certainly no discouragement."}
{"prompt": "Need for reformation", "completion": "At what point in history did the Church need a reformation?  I have heard people say that the Church needed a reformation as early as the 2nd century because it had become Roman Catholic in its teaching.  I have heard others say that the Church did not need a reformation until the 16th century, and these people support reading books such as The Imitation of Christ that are generally considered Roman Catholic.  I have even seen some Lutheran Franciscans!  At what point did the Church become corrupt and need to be reformed?\n\n\nI suppose the answer can depend on what you see in the word \u201creformation.\u201d If \u201creformation\u201d is simply the church addressing doctrinal errors and removing them, then reformation was needed and implemented already in the first century. The church meeting in Jerusalem (Acts 15) addressed the error of the Judaizers.\nThe Judaizers taught a way of salvation that combined faith in Jesus and the works of the law. The church rejected that and restated what all of Scripture teaches\u2014that people enjoy salvation through faith in Jesus Christ alone.\nYou might enjoy an article from the \u201cReformation issue\u201d of Forward in Christ last October. The article speaks of \u201ca constant need for reform.\u201d This link will take you to that article."}
{"prompt": "Church fathers", "completion": "Why does the Book of Concord quote from the church fathers?  I have always been told that the church fathers are Roman Catholic.\n\n\nMany of the church fathers quoted lived at a time before we would recognize a \u201cRoman Catholic Church\u201d (approximately 400 A.D.). Because of that, they would not be Roman Catholic.\nSuch quotations from church fathers, of course, are not presented as being of equal weight as Scripture. The quotations describe how the early church understood and taught biblical doctrines."}
{"prompt": "KJV readers", "completion": "How many people in the WELS read the King James Version of the Bible?  \n\n\nI would not be able to provide a number for you. If people are using the King James Version, hopefully they are able to understand the message that is conveyed in language unlike our everyday communication today. More contemporary translations make it easier to understand the content."}
{"prompt": "Selah", "completion": "I have been reading through the Psalms and noticed that in the NIV2011, the word Selah is removed from the text and is now just a footnote.  The word Selah was part of the text in the NIV1984 and many other Bible translations and is part of the Hebrew text.  I have always been taught that God's word should never be changed.  Why is the word Selah removed in the NIV2011? \n\n\nBe assured that no one is changing God\u2019s word. The differences in the translations reflect the challenge translators have in rendering that Hebrew term in English. It is thought that Selah refers to a musical instruction for the singing of the psalm, but translators are not entirely sure what that instruction was. For that reason, Bible translations can put the word in the verses or list it as a \u201cfootnote.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Matthew 5:28 and marriage", "completion": "With Matthew 5:28 in mind, is it a sin to lust sexually after your spouse (if you are married)?\n\n\nGod designed sexual relations for the marriage bond (Hebrews 13:4). Jesus\u2019 words in the Sermon on the Mount speak of sinful thoughts toward someone who is not part of the marriage bond.\nWith your question in mind, it could happen that a person\u2019s thoughts of his/her spouse could distort God\u2019s design for marriage, in that the person looks upon the spouse as a sex object. 1 Corinthians 7 tells husbands and wives how to view each other and themselves when it comes to their sexual lives."}
{"prompt": "Shroud of Turin", "completion": "Is the Shroud of Turin authentic?  It seems very contested and disputed.\n\n\nIt looks to be a cloth from the Middle Ages. Even if it were from a much earlier age, one wonders how it could possibly be tied to one person: Jesus of Nazareth.\nThankfully, we do not need artifacts like this to authenticate the person and ministry of Jesus Christ. Scripture is sufficient. Scripture reveals Jesus as our perfect and complete Savior (John 20:31)."}
{"prompt": "WELS and doctrine", "completion": "Since there is no perfect church on earth or a church that can be 100% accurate this side of heaven, what would be areas of doctrine or teachings that WELS might possibly be wrong on?\n\n\nPersonally, I am not plagued with doubts about our church body\u2019s doctrine or practice. As a church body, we do not pretend to be the only church whose teachings are entirely biblical; the kingdom of God is not limited to WELS. We believe we are holding to the truths of God\u2019s word. If others accuse us of error in doctrine or practice, we are certainly willing and interested to listen, and see what Scripture says about their claims and our confession."}
{"prompt": "Bible translations and wild animals", "completion": "Unicorns are clearly mentioned in the KJV 9 times.   Why have newer versions changed it to wild ox or buffalo?\n\n\nThe King James Version continued the thought from the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament, that animals mentioned in places like Numbers 23:22, Deuteronomy 33:17 and Job 39:9 were unicorns.\nNewer Bible translations render the Hebrew word as a \u201cwild ox\u201d or buffalo-like animal because that is keeping with the context of the passages that describe a strong and ferocious animal."}
{"prompt": "Interacting with atheist co-worker", "completion": "One of my co-workers (80 years old) is an atheist and also a former Catholic priest.  I try to be polite to him in our discussions about non-religious and non-political topics.  However, because I'm a conservative and strong in my faith, he at best tolerates me.  Today he asked about my thoughts on Donald Trump as President.  I responded by saying that I really only put my trust in God as my Lord and Savior and not so much to those who hold public office.  He asked me why I believe in God.  I told him that we should discuss this while not at work, as it's not a short discussion and that work is not the place to talk about religion.  I did tell him that I will not apologize for my conservative or Christian values.  The only thing he told me was that my being near him with my religious beliefs really bothered him.  Am I correct in thinking that because he has turned his back on our Lord that his heart has been hardened, much like Pharaoh's heart was?  Would being in his presence endanger my faith? Or, would it be best that I just pray for this individual and let the Holy Spirit work in him?  I'd hate to see him be condemned to an eternity of separation from our Lord, knowing there was something I could do to help, such as prayer.  As I've learned, the nature of the dead is to stay dead and I'm afraid that he is spiritually dead.\n\n\nPeering into hearts is something only God can do (1 Samuel 16:7). We cannot see whether someone has hardened his or her heart; we cannot see if God has, consequently, hardened that person\u2019s heart.\nCertainly, being in the presence of people who are opposed to our faith can be dangerous if we adopt their way of thinking. On the other hand, associating with people who reject the truths of God\u2019s word provides opportunities for us to share the biblical truths they need to hear and believe.\n\u201cSpeak the truth in love\u201d (Ephesians 4:15) to your co-worker as you have opportunity. Pray that God blesses your words and Christian example, so that others can praise God (Matthew 5:16).\nFinally, keep in mind that when you experience troubles and difficulties in life because your \u201creligious beliefs bother\u201d other people, that is what the Christian cross is all about. Jesus tells us to take up our cross and follow him in faith (Mark 8:34). May God strengthen you through his gospel to do just that."}
{"prompt": "The Lord's presence in our lives", "completion": "Jesus says, \"Surely I am with you always to the very end of the age\" (Matthew 28). He also says, \"Where two or three come together, there I am with them\" (Matthew 18). What's the difference between these? Is the first talking about our individual relationship with Christ, and the second talking about Christ's relationship with the church? I know as omnipresent true God, Christ is always with me, even when I am not with another person. Can you please clarify the difference? Thanks.\n\n\nIt looks like you are heading in the right direction when it comes to providing a helpful understanding of these two promises of our Lord.\nIn Matthew 28, Jesus commissioned his church to teach God\u2019s word and baptize people throughout the world. To comfort and strengthen his followers for this mission, Jesus promised to be with them always.\nIn Matthew 18, we see what the Christian church is all about. The Christian church consists of people, even as few as two or three, who are assembled in the Lord\u2019s name. While God\u2019s omnipresence penetrates every part of his creation, the Lord promises his special, gracious presence to Christians who gather in his name. Jesus\u2019 promise in Matthew 18 is in the context of believers uniting together in prayer.\nPut together, these passages remind you and me that we are not alone in this world. God is with us, and he has promised never to leave us or forsake us (Hebrews 13:5)."}
{"prompt": "The Bible and slavery", "completion": "In Leviticus God seems to be condoning slavery.  Isn't slavery sinful?\r\n\r\n\n\n\nPrevious questions on this topic received a response like this: \u201cSlavery was permitted in the Old Testament, but was carefully regulated (Leviticus 25:39-53, Exodus 21:2-11). Slaves were protected and had to be set free if injured (Exodus 21:26-27). Every fiftieth year (the year of Jubilee) Israelite slaves were to be set free (Leviticus 25:39-41). Stealing or kidnapping a person to enslave him or her was punishable by death (Deuteronomy 24:7, Exodus 21:16).\n\u201cThe New Testament also condemns kidnappers or slave traders (1 Timothy 1:10). Nevertheless the New Testament instructs slaves to submit to their masters, even the masters who were harsh (1 Peter 2:18ff, Ephesians 6:5-8). The Apostles did not attempt to overturn the structures of society by encouraging disobedience or rebellion. Paul returned the slave Onesimus to his Christian master Philemon. Onesimus had run away and subsequently become a Christian. Paul did not command Philemon to free him, but encouraged him to receive Onesimus as a brother (Philemon 8-21).\n\u201cChristianity transcends social distinctions (Galatians 3:28). Free men are slaves to Christ and slaves are free in Christ\u2013 a person\u2019s social position means nothing before God (1 Corinthians 7:20-24). Yet slaves were encouraged to gain their freedom if possible (1 Corinthians 7:21). Although the Bible never encourages the overthrow of social or political structures through disobedience or rebellion, wherever the gospel has taken firm root slavery has disappeared. When hearts are changed by the gospel message of forgiveness of sins and salvation in Christ, people put into practice Jesus\u2019 words, \u2018In everything, do to others you would have them do to you\u2019 (Matthew 7:12).\u201d\nHistory tells us that there were different ways in which people became slaves. Some were prisoners of war. Others suffered economic losses and willingly placed themselves into the service of others in exchange for the basic necessities of life. Still others, sadly, were bought and sold as property. While people might have entered slavery in different ways, the Bible\u2019s message to everyone involved in it was to exercise Christian love.\nA recent article in Forward in Christ addressed the subject of slavery. This link will take you to it."}
{"prompt": "Officers in PTO", "completion": "I am a WELS member serving on the church council and department of education for our elementary school (K thru 8).  We have a parent/teacher organization (PTO) that thinks it is OK to elect a non-member as an officer in the PTO.  Is this OK, or is it against our church fellowship doctrine?\n\n\nYou would do well to find out if your PTO has a constitution and bylaws, or other documents, which provide guidance and direction for the organization. Such documents will spell out the qualifications and responsibilities of the organization\u2019s officers. Information from those sources will explain if and how non-members are able to serve in the capacity you inquired.

{"prompt": "Meaning of Proverbs 3:5", "completion": "What does Proverbs 3:5 mean?  Thanking you in advance.\n\n\n\u201cTrust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding\u201d (Proverbs 3:5). The verse instructs us to put all our trust in the Lord and not our own knowledge. The verse tells us not to be reliant on our strength and knowledge, but to trust in the Lord.\nThose instructions are true when it comes to the biggest issue of life: salvation. Those instructions are true when it comes to the everyday mysteries and challenges of life. We may not be able to figure out why things are or aren\u2019t happening in life, but Christian faith says, \u201cMy God knows what is going on, he is in control and I trust him.\u201d\nProverbs 3:5 directs us to look less at ourselves and more to God\u2014and to trust him completely."}
{"prompt": "Origin of soul", "completion": "Does man's everlasting soul begin at conception?\n\n\nYes. The Bible does not teach a pre-existence of souls. The Bible describes human beings as consisting of both bodies and souls (Ecclesiastes 12:7; Matthew 10:28; Philippians 1:21-26). We find such life in the womb before birth (Psalm 139:13-18)."}
{"prompt": "Meaning of Sheol", "completion": "Can you please explain Sheol? In a recent Bible study, this subject came up and I knew nothing about it (in spite of my elementary thru college WELS education). Why is this not spoken of more? Also, how does this differ from our thoughts that a believer dies and goes home to heaven? \n\n\nThe Hebrew word sheol can mean \u201cthe grave,\u201d \u201cthe realm of the dead,\u201d or \u201chell.\u201d The context will determine the meaning.\nOne of the ways Bible writers used sheol is to speak of believers and unbelievers dying, with their bodies then buried in graves. In that sense and context, believers\u2014like all people\u2014go to sheol. On the other hand, Bible writers used sheol to speak of unbelievers going to hell. Context, again, determines the specific meaning of the word sheol.\nThe Bible has different words to speak of believers \u201cdying and going home to heaven.\u201d\nYour question is a reminder that death is a common experience for people, but people\u2019s souls go to heaven or hell based on faith in Jesus or unbelief (Mark 16:16)."}
{"prompt": "How to join a congregation", "completion": "I am a confirmed Missouri Synod Lutheran and have been attending a WELS church for three years. I am now interested in joining the church. Do I need to take the Good News classes?  It appears to be taking more than a year to finish the classes at the church I attend.  I feel I need to participate in the Lord's Supper once again.  Please guide me. Thank you!!\n\n\nA common route to membership for someone in your situation is called \u201cprofession of faith\u201d or \u201caffirmation of faith.\u201d That route to membership often bypasses the longer series of classes that leads to adult confirmation.\nBecause each congregation has freedom to address membership questions like this, you will do best to contact the pastor of the WELS church where you have been attending. He will explain the path to membership. God\u2019s blessings on your affiliation with our church body and your walk with Jesus."}
{"prompt": "Meaning of Numbers 5", "completion": "Murdoch's Bible NIV 2011 - what do you think of his editors going with the abortion translation on Numbers 5: 21- 25?  Neither the Kretzmann commentary or Pastor Beck translated it that way.  It most certainly does open the door to have the right to an abortion if there was adultery. There is so much more wrong with that translation that has been pointed out to pastors not just laymen, yet we are using it. Why?\r\n\n\n\nNumbers 5:21-25 does not in any way sanction abortion. The verses speak of a practice the Israelites could have used in the case of suspected unfaithfulness in marriage. The practice put the determination of guilt or innocence in the hands of the Lord. If the verdict was \u201cguilty,\u201d then there were physical consequences for the woman. Translators have rendered the Hebrew for those consequences in different ways. In the case of the NIV, the content of the footnotes of Numbers 5:22-23 (NIV84) became the text for Numbers 5:22-23 in NIV2011. The meaning appears to be that the consequences of unfaithfulness affected the part of the body involved in both adultery and fertility.\nIn no way does that section of the Bible authorize or permit abortion. The verses speak of a practice for Old Testament Israel that addressed suspected unfaithfulness. If there were adverse physical consequences for the woman, it was the result of God rendering a \u201cguilty\u201d verdict in the matter.\nWhen it comes to the use of Bible translations, that is a congregational matter. The recent discussions in our church body regarding translations have been in the context of publishing materials."}
{"prompt": "Fundraisers and stewardship of giving", "completion": "What part should fundraising play in the church and in our schools? What scriptural principles can we look to for guidance when approaching people for needs that arise in the church? It seems that the numerous gimmicks and matching funds and golf and wine outings take away from the true heart of giving. It seems that this leads to a selfish kind of giving, one where people will only give, or will give more, if they are getting something out of it. (Is it potentially a lack of trust for us to think we need to go beyond simply presenting whatever needs there are to the members and asking that the Lord bless the effort if it is His will?) \n\n\nWhen needs arise, we can inform people of the special opportunities those situations present for special giving. We see the apostle Paul doing that in 2 Corinthians 8:1-7 (and other epistles), where he informed Christians of the opportunity of helping fellow believers in Jerusalem. We do that today when we inform God\u2019s people about natural disasters that have brought about financial hardships in the lives of others.\nWhen needs present Christians with additional, specific opportunities for giving, Christians will again examine how God has blessed them and how they might \u201cdo good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers\u201d (Galatians 6:10). Christians will want to respond to those opportunities without thoughts of guilt or obligation or reward. \u201cGod loves a cheerful giver\u201d (2 Corinthians 9:7) is true whether we are talking about regular giving or special giving.\nWhen it comes to fundraising in the church, Christians will want to exercise caution\u2014out of interest for fellow Christians and for the unchurched in the community. Fundraising that targets the community can reinforce the common, wrong idea that people can have: that the church is concerned only about money. Such fundraising can also send the signal that the church cannot carry out its mission but needs the help of others.\nSome fundraising efforts include benefits for the giver, as you noted. In instances like that, the people donating money might very well be purchasing products they would be buying elsewhere. The fundraiser can enable people to purchase that product, perhaps give an additional amount of money, and fund a specific effort or project. In other words, the fundraiser might be providing an opportunity for donors to redirect their purchases of items for a worthwhile cause.\nThere certainly is a danger that fundraisers can fuel the idea that giving involves getting or receiving something in return. Here is where biblical principles of giving are helpful.\nThe starting point is that God owns everything (Psalm 24:1). We don\u2019t own a thing. God entrusts his possessions to us for faithful management of them (Matthew 25:14-30). It is love for God and gratitude for his love that provides the motivation for giving back to God what is his in the first place (2 Corinthians 5:15; 1 John 4:19). You and I have reason for planning our giving and planning offerings that are proportionate to how God has blessed us individually (1 Corinthians 16:2). Those are just some biblical principles of giving that come to mind.\n\u201cFreely you have received; freely give\u201d (Matthew 10:8). Jesus\u2019 words were certainly applicable to his first disciples. They are applicable to Christians today as well."}
{"prompt": "God and his revelation to people", "completion": "I can't understand why God chose to deliver His messages through man. Since man is so ignorant and limited, it is very easy to produce misunderstandings. Instead of delivering His messages through a human prophet, God could have delivered the same message,  producing the same dream at the same time in the minds of every single person in Israel or sending an angel to speak to every single person instead of speaking to a prophet and then letting the prophet deliver the message to others.\r\nSince there are more efficient methods of delivering a message, why did God did not use them? Why would he complain if the people do not believe in Him, if he used such poor way to communicate?\n\n\n\u201cIn the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom also he made the universe\u201d (Hebrews 1:1-2). Those verses explain how God has given his message to people. When God delivered his word through prophets and his Son, he looked for people to relay and share that word with others (Isaiah 49:6; Matthew 28:18-20; 1 Peter 2:9).\nAny thoughts of God taking a risk by getting his message out in this way are dismissed when we understand that God controlled his message. \u201cAbove all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet\u2019s own interpretation of things. For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit\u201d (2 Peter 1:20-21).\nIf people claimed to have received a message from God, the Lord provided a way for determining whether or not the individual and his message were to be believed (Deuteronomy 18:21-22).\nYour question underscores how God\u2019s ways are different from ours (Isaiah 55:8-11). \u201cDifferent\u201d in this case does not mean wrong. \u201cDifferent\u201d means \u201cwise.\u201d I encourage you to read 1 Corinthians chapter one to see the great difference between 1) people\u2019s ideas and 2) God\u2019s thoughts and plans and actions. Our reaction to that difference, one that is prompted by the Holy Spirit, is this: \u201cto the only wise God be glory forever through Jesus Christ! Amen.\u201d (Romans 16:27)"}

This means that women may not serve as pastors nor participate in assemblies of the church in ways that exercise authority over men (1 Corinthians 11:3; 14:33-35).\u201d One of those assemblies is the voters\u2019 assembly.\nAnother resource on this website that may be helpful for you is the document titled \u201cMan and Woman Roles.\u201d This link will take you to that document.\nWhile women in WELS congregations do not cast votes in voters\u2019 assemblies, that does not speak at all to their status in God\u2019s sight.

There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.

Through many people and various means, the gospel is reaching more and more people. Also, like the apostle Paul (1 Corinthians 12:3; Ephesians 2:8-9, I am desirous that people understand that faith in the gospel message is a gift of the Holy Spirit.\nFinally, like the apostle Paul, my prayer is that \u201cthe word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be honored\u201d (2 Thessalonians 3:1).

{"prompt": "Presiding minister and words of institution", "completion": "The new seminary graduate who recently began serving our congregation has an unusual approach to consecrating the elements during the Lord's Supper.  When it is time for him to read the Words of Institution, he takes a step or two away from the altar (it is built into the chancel wall), turns his back to the elements on the altar table, and reads the Words of Institution to the congregation.  He doesn't make the sign of the cross over the cup and paten, or make a simple hand motion to indicate what is being set aside for the Sacrament. One would be hard pressed to know we were celebrating the Sacrament until the distribution begins.   Am I wrong in asking him to at least stand next to the elements when reading the Words of Institution instead of turning his back to them?\n\n\nI contacted Professor James Tiefel of Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary regarding the training seminary students receive to consecrate the elements in the Lord\u2019s Supper. Prof. Tiefel serves as Dean of Chapel and teaches worship and homiletics courses.\nHe explained that when the consecration takes place at a wall altar, the presiding minister is either to take the vessels in his hands and turn toward the people (and make the sign of the cross at \u201cThis is my body/This is my blood of the covenant\u201d) or stand at the side of the elements and speak to the people while pointing to the elements, alternately looking at the people and the elements.

On the contrary, I believe our WELS teaching on the true body of Christ present in Holy Communion, and the obviously miraculous way that his true body can be present at multiple places in the world at the same time.  Can you explain what the Bible says about the corporeal body of Christ in this post-ascension time of history? And how does the truth of God's omnipresence relate to the corporeal body of Christ. \n\n\nTraditional Reformed theology holds the erroneous view that Jesus\u2019 human body can occupy only one space at a time. With that wrong idea in mind, Reformed theology envisions Jesus\u2019 body\u2014after his ascension\u2014only in heaven, and the earthly elements in the Lord\u2019s Supper merely symbolize his body.\nWhen Jesus ascended into heaven, he withdrew his visible presence from his followers on earth. He did not abandon them. He promises: \u201cFor where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them\u201d (Matthew 18:20). The God-Man, Jesus, with his human nature and body as well as according to his deity, is present when his followers gather in his name. Shortly before his ascension, Jesus gave a similar promise of his presence in the lives of his followers: \u201cAnd surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age\u201d (Matthew 28:20). Jesus\u2019 divine nature shares with his human nature characteristics or attributes so that his body is also capable of being present anywhere and everywhere he wills to be (omnipresence). His body is truly present in the Lord\u2019s Supper (Matthew 26:26-28).\nWhile these truths of Scripture may go beyond our understanding, Spirit-worked faith believes them. Like you, I do not seek to change Scripture to make it more understandable to my mind."}
{"prompt": "Baptism and salvation", "completion": "Is baptism necessary for justification and salvation?\n\n\nChristian faith is necessary to enjoy God\u2019s verdict of \u201cnot guilty\u201d (Romans 3:28; 5:1). It is the lack of faith that condemns, not the lack of baptism (Mark 16:16).\nBaptism is necessary in the sense that the Lord commands us to administer baptism. It is not for us to decide whether or not we are going to do what the Lord says. However, baptism is not absolutely necessary for salvation because the Holy Spirit can bring people to saving faith in Jesus through the gospel in Word alone. In cases like that, people will still want to be baptized\u2014to do what Jesus says and to receive, in addition to the message of the Bible, another guarantee of God\u2019s love and forgiveness in Christ."}
{"prompt": "Conquest of promised land", "completion": "What's the difference between Islam jihad of wiping out the infidels, and the Old Testament Israelite people going through Canaan and wiping out the peoples there? (e.g., Deuteronomy 7)\r\n\r\n\n\n\nThe God of Islam does not exist. Any warfare in Allah\u2019s name is illegitimate and idolatrous.\nOn the other hand, the God of the Bible, the Triune God, is God alone (Isaiah 45:5). As the Creator of all things, only God or his representatives in government can end life (Genesis 9:5-6; Deuteronomy 32:39; Psalm 90:3; Romans 13:4). As the Creator and owner of all things (Psalm 24:1), God instructed his people to take control of the land of Canaan. Past answers to similar questions have contained thoughts like these:\n\u201cThe gross idolatries and sexual depravities of the Canaanites were longstanding, persistent, and posed a horrible influence on their neighbors, and spread a deadly contagion among the covenant nation of God. They were impenitent peoples who had hardened their hearts against revealed truth and were dangerous to the spiritual lives of God\u2019s people. They had received ample information that the Promised Land had been promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; had been given opportunity to vacate the territory; and knew very well that God meant business in leading the Israelites into Canaan after the Exodus from Egypt and the crossing of the Red Sea. God\u2019s clear purpose in driving out or exterminating impenitent idolaters was to serve the preservation and spread of the promises of a Savior that God entrusted to the Israelites. God was constructing a hedge around his people to allow them to keep the messianic promises and family line intact so it could ultimately be shared with the world.\u201d\nThere is no comparison between the actions of a false religion\u2019s adherents and the actions of the only true God."}
{"prompt": "Souls between death and judgment day", "completion": "While you're in heaven as a spirit and without a body, will you be able to communicate with other spirits if we have no body?  Will our thoughts just travel from one spirit to another without talking?\n\n\nThe Bible provides little specific information regarding what souls in heaven or hell are experiencing prior to the last day. The big picture, of course, is that the souls of Christians are experiencing the joys and perfection of heaven, while the souls of unbelievers are experiencing the horror, pain and punishment of hell.\nThe account of the rich man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31) describes the soul of the rich man in hell seeing, speaking and feeling pain. One of the apostle John\u2019s visions (Revelation 6:9-11) describes the souls of believers in heaven speaking to the Lord.\nThe Bible\u2019s emphasis is on judgment day and following\u2014when everyone, body and soul, will experience either eternal joys through Christian faith or eternal sorrows through unbelief (Mark 16:16)."}
{"prompt": "The Apostles' Creed and Jesus' descent into hell", "completion": "I was speaking with a friend the other day who mentioned that not all \"Christian\" denominations believe that Christ not only died the worst earthly death, but also suffered in hell for the sins of all people for all eternity. He also mentioned that this was reflected in the Apostles' Creed, and that it was changed years ago. Being a member of the WELS, I am familiar and fully agree with the statement \"He descended into hell.\" However, some denominations changed it to \"He descended to the dead.\" My questions involve a couple concerns: 1) When was this change made and why? 2) Does this change reflect that some Christians don't believe Jesus fully suffered in hell? Thank you.\n\n\nFor years, there have been misunderstandings and false teachings regarding Jesus\u2019 descent into hell. Roman Catholic Church theology maintains that Jesus descended to a limbus patrum, a limbo of the fathers, to free Old Testament believers and take them to heaven. Traditional Reformed theology teaches that Jesus\u2019 descent into hell was part of his suffering for sin.\nSome churches and people also erroneously believe that Jesus\u2019 descent was to the realm of the dead where all people go upon life\u2019s end: a Sheol or Hades\u2014a place apart from this world that does not take into account their judgment to heaven or hell. \u201cHe descended to the dead\u201d reflects that kind of thinking.\nThe English Language Liturgical Consultation is an international group that seeks to gather information and consensus on liturgical forms. Their mission is then to produce and promote common texts. Their version of the Apostles\u2019 Creed states that Jesus \u201cdescended to the dead.\u201d The Consultation\u2019s influence is evident when we consider that churches like the Reformed Church in America and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America make use of their version of the Apostles\u2019 Creed.\nJesus\u2019 suffering for sin came to an end on the cross. After Jesus\u2019 body and soul were reunited in Joseph\u2019s tomb on Easter Sunday morning, and before the risen Lord appeared to his followers on earth, Jesus descended into hell to proclaim his victory over Satan (1 Peter 3:18-20). Jesus\u2019 descent was a victory march (Colossians 2:15), the first step in his state of exaltation."}
{"prompt": "The Bible's genealogies of Jesus", "completion": "Why do Matthew and Luke show different genealogies for Jesus?\n\n\nA common explanation of the genealogies is that Matthew provides the legal descent through Joseph, Jesus\u2019 legal father, and Luke provides Jesus\u2019 physical descent through Mary. With Joseph as his legal father, Jesus was David\u2019s legal descendant. Romans 1:3 attests to that. Luke traces Jesus\u2019 family line through Mary, and the evangelist demonstrates that Jesus is connected to Adam and Eve (Genesis 3:15).\nJesus, the eternal Son of God, did not appear out of thin air when he entered this world to fulfill the promises of the Savior. No, there was a lineage and ancestry that could be traced. As you noted, Scripture even provides two genealogies."}
{"prompt": "Old Testament Israel and missions", "completion": "Why did the Israelites do little to spread God's Word (at that time, the promise of the Savior) to other nations?\n\n\nI am not sure what led you to that conclusion, but it is not an accurate one. Certainly, the ceremonial laws that God gave to the people of Israel were designed to keep them separate from the heathen nations around them, but God\u2019s will was that his people share the news of a promised Messiah with others. And they did.\nI can recommend to you two resources that elaborate more on that truth. This first link will take you to a \u201cLight for our Path\u201d column that addressed a question that was similar to yours: \u201cWere the Jews to spread the message about the promised Savior even to Gentiles, as we do mission work today?\u201d\nThis second link will give you access to a short paper: \u201cThe Mission Mindset of God\u2019s Old Testament People.\u201d\nGod had promised Abraham: \u201cAll peoples on earth will be blessed through you\u201d (Genesis 12:3). The people of the world would be blessed through the Savior who would come through Abraham\u2019s lineage. The people of the world needed to hear of that promised Savior, the Messiah. God\u2019s Old Testament people of Israel spread the word."}
{"prompt": "Living a life of faith", "completion": "I recently moved from the town where I came to faith in the WELS church, literally across the street, to a location where the nearest WELS church is about an hour and a half away. Although there are a lot of churches around (almost literally one on every corner), there are none that we are in fellowship with. I've felt myself becoming terribly lonely and disheartened by the prospect of never again experiencing fellowship with any neighbors or people in my community. So much so that I've even caught myself losing my desire to witness to \"these heathens and false teachers,\" and I know that emotion is sinful because the first thing that comes to mind when I hold the light of Scripture to my own heart is Jonah trying to evade God's command to witness to Ninevah.\r\nSince the logistics of traveling currently preclude getting to the WELS church much more than once per month, what are the best examples from Scripture for a lay-person to live \"missionally\" and continue to bear witness and fulfill the Great Commission?\n\n\nHere are a few biblical examples that come to mind: the unnamed Israelite girl in 2 Kings 5, Daniel (chapter 6), Nehemiah, the healing of the demon-possessed man (Luke 8:26-39), Lydia (Acts 16:11-15) and the heroes of faith chapter of the Bible (Hebrews 11).\nIf the distance from your home to your congregation is a barrier to more frequent participation in worship services, do speak to your pastor. He can direct you to many resources that can supplement your devotional life. God bless you with the strength to let your light of faith shine brightly in your life."}
{"prompt": "God's allowance of evil to take place", "completion": "Why does God allow bad things to keep happening when you are asking for help?\n\n\nI cannot pretend to speak for God as to why, in your life specifically, events are taking place. What I can in a general way is that God deals with his children out of love. He does not punish Christians for their sins; he has already punished Jesus in our place (Romans 4:25; 8:1).\nWhen it comes to prayer, God promises to hear and answer our prayers (Psalm 34:15). Even when God\u2019s answers to our prayers are not what we have in mind, we can be comforted that God\u2019s answers are always for our best (2 Corinthians 12:1-10).\nGod\u2019s thoughts and ways are different and better than ours (Isaiah 55:8-9). His wisdom far surpasses ours (Romans 11:33-36). He is the one in whom we want to place our trust in all of life (Psalm 46). That trust is never misplaced (Psalm 25:3).\nA recent Light for our Path column addressed the subject matter of God allowing bad things to happen in life. This link will take you to that column. God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Wrong information on predestination", "completion": "During a Bible study on Ephesians, a fellow church member told me that some people are predestined to hell before they are born. How can this be?\n\n\nIt can\u2019t be. Scripture speaks of only an election of grace, an election to salvation.\nWhen it comes to people forfeiting the salvation which Jesus Christ won, the Bible makes it clear that people are to blame (Hosea 13:9; Matthew 23:37). God wants all to be saved (1 Timothy 2:4). He wants all to come to repentance (2 Peter 3:9).\u00a0 God does not take pleasure in the death of the wicked (Ezekiel 33:11).\nYou can help your fellow church member by passing along this biblical information to him or her."}
{"prompt": "Reading the early church fathers", "completion": "Should Lutherans read the early church fathers? \n\n\nReading the writings of the early church fathers can be valuable. What you will find from such reading is that some early church fathers expressed biblical truths, while others did not. Even the ones who wrote accurately about the Bible did not always do so consistently.\nThat observation simply underscores the conclusion that we make: that their writings can be valuable and insightful, but Scripture alone is the source of our faith. That is because Scripture is truthful in whatever it says (John 17:17)."}
{"prompt": "Baptism and adults", "completion": "We believe that God uses baptism to create faith in infants\u2014they need it because of their inherent sinfulness. Why is the same not true of older people? Why would we say that baptism instantly creates faith in babies but not in adults? \n\n\nThrough water and the word God can bring anyone \u2013 of any age \u2013 to faith. The gospel is God\u2019s power to save (Romans 1:16). With adults, we ordinarily provide some instruction in God\u2019s word before administering Baptism because that is how we see the New Testament church functioning in the book of Acts. What we see most often in life is that God changes the hearts of adults through his word alone. That same word, then, provides adults with information about the importance and blessings of Baptism, which they are encouraged to receive.\nLike children, adults are in need of God\u2019s forgiveness because of their sinful natures and their actual sins. Christian faith, created through the word of God alone or through water and the word in Baptism, connects people to Jesus Christ in faith and gives them the forgiveness of sins and eternal life that Jesus won."}
{"prompt": "Fifth Commandment and self-defense", "completion": "What is the biblical stance on self-defense that ends up in someone being killed/murdered in relation to the Fifth Commandment?  Does God allow us to protect our family to that point, or are we charged to love our enemy and pray for those who persecute us regardless of what harm they may be intending to inflict? An example would be a home invasion or something of that sort.\n\n\nThe Hebrew word in the Fifth Commandment (Exodus 20:13 and Deuteronomy 5:17) prohibits murder\u2014the illegal and inappropriate taking of human life\u2014and does not forbid all taking of life. So, for example, governments can rightly implement capital punishment (Romans 13:4) if they so choose.\nWhat about individuals who want to protect themselves and their families, you wonder? Some Christians look to Matthew 5:39 and Romans 12:17 as absolute directives not to resist physical threats. In their context though the verses advocate love toward others instead of seeking revenge.\nOthers look to sections of Scripture like Proverbs 24:11-12 and Luke 22:35-38 as the basis for defending oneself and one\u2019s family from physical threats. John 18:10-11 describes Peter\u2019s wrongful use of a weapon as he tried to interfere with the Lord\u2019s humble submission to his Father\u2019s will.\nThe positive emphasis of the Fifth Commandment \u201cto help and befriend [our neighbor] in every bodily need\u201d can find application in defending oneself and one\u2019s family with a weapon."}
{"prompt": "College scholarships", "completion": "I'm wondering if our Synod offers scholarships to our Lutheran High School students who have chosen not to attend a Lutheran College?  \n\n\nThere are no synodical scholarships for students in your daughter\u2019s circumstances. Synod mission offerings help subsidize educational costs for students who attend the schools that the Synod owns and operates: Luther Preparatory School, Watertown, Wisconsin; Michigan Lutheran Seminary, Saginaw, Michigan; Martin Luther College, New Ulm, Minnesota; and, Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary, Mequon, Wisconsin."}
{"prompt": "Women on call lists", "completion": "Why are women not put on call lists for principals? I know there are two at one of our schools in Milwaukee.\n\n\nBecause of the biblical principles of the roles of men and women (1 Corinthians 11:3; 14:33-35; 1 Timothy 2:11-12), a woman would not ordinarily be put on a call list to be principal at a school whose staff consists of men and women teachers. There have been instances of a woman serving as principal of an all-female staff. If women serve as principals in other settings, the position is structured in such a way as to follow the biblical roles of men and women."}
{"prompt": "Date of Easter", "completion": "Why does Easter move from year to year? I understand that it is always on Sunday but why not the same Sunday in either March or April? Thank you. \n\n\nThe history behind the dating of Easter Sunday is involved and associated with some controversies. Early Christians were not agreed on when to celebrate Easter. Then, in 325 A.D., the Council of Nicea adopted the formula that Easter Sunday would be the first Sunday after the first full moon that follows the vernal equinox (March 20/21). That means that the date for Easter can range from March 22 to April 25. While the western Christian church follows this formula, the eastern Christian church does not.\nWe want to keep this information in perspective by remembering that God did not command his New Testament followers to establish a church calendar. While the establishment of a church calendar is an exercise of Christian freedom, such a calendar is certainly worthwhile and helpful because it puts regular focus on the saving works of Jesus.\nThe designation of Easter Sunday on a calendar is an arbitrary decision. For New Testament Christians, the same is true regarding Sunday as the regular day of worship. And yet, there is a connection between that day of the week and Easter. With the Old Testament Sabbath day laws abolished, early Christians chose Sunday as a regular day of worship. They did that to have a \u201clittle Easter\u201d celebration each Sunday.\nSo, whether it is a little Easter celebration in the middle of July or the big Easter celebration on April 1, 2018, this is what is truly important: \u201cBut Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep\u201d (1 Corinthians 15:20)."}
{"prompt": "The Bible's teaching of original sin", "completion": "I am currently talking to someone about what Lutherans believe. I got to a point to where he eventually agreed with me on certain things (he is a member of the Churches of Christ denomination). He said one thing he just can't seem to agree with is original sin or that a baby is sinful. How can I prove original sin to him with biblical support? I showed him Psalm 51:5 and he said that this doesn't apply to us. He said David was just explaining how sinful he was and how bad he felt about his sin, and that he was using this as an exaggeration. Do you have any advice on how I can correctly interpret this verse for him?\n\n\nWe do find hyperbole in the Bible, but the context makes it very clear that we are dealing with that figure of speech. For example, the Pharisees were upset about all the accolades Jesus received from his Palm Sunday entrance in Jerusalem and his earlier miracle of raising Lazarus from the dead by saying about him, \u201cSee, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!\u201d (John 12:19) Did every person in the world become a follower of Jesus of Nazareth? Not by any stretch of the imagination. The people who made that statement about Jesus were still clearly opposed to him. It is clear from the context that we are dealing with hyperbole.\nThere is nothing in the context of Psalm 51 to suggest that King David was using hyperbolic language. In the preceding verses David recognized and confessed his \u201ciniquity,\u201d \u201csin\u201d and \u201ctransgression.\u201d David knew how thoroughly sin had stained his life. In verse five David explains how sin and a sinful condition were not recent additions to his life. No, sin became part of his life when his life began; he inherited a sinful nature at conception.\nDavid\u2019s confession of his natural sinful condition is not the only place in the Bible where we find the doctrine of original sin. Other passages that could be helpful for you in your conversations are: Genesis 5:3; 8:21; John 3:6; Romans 3:23; 5:12; 7:18; 8:7; and, Ephesians 2:1-3.\nGod bless your conversations!"}

{"prompt": "WELS' teaching on justification", "completion": "I just happened across a YouTube channel produced by a pastor from the Evangelical Lutheran Diocese of North America (ELDoNA) church body who claims WELS is teaching false doctrine in regard to universal justification vs. justification by faith.  Please enlighten me and others where such a claim might be derived.  \n\n\nThis We Believe, a statement of belief of WELS, states:\n\u201c1. We believe that God has justified all sinners, that is, he has declared them righteous for the sake of Christ. This is the central message of Scripture upon which the very existence of the church depends. It is a message relevant to people of all times and places, of all races and social levels, for \u2018the result of one trespass was condemnation for all men\u2019 (Romans 5:18). All need forgiveness of sins before God, and Scripture proclaims that all have been justified, for \u2018the result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men\u2019 (Romans 5:18).\n\u201c2. We believe that individuals receive this free gift of forgiveness not on the basis of their own works, but only through faith (Ephesians 2:8,9). Justifying faith is trust in Christ and his redemptive work. This faith justifies not because of any power it has in itself, but only because of the salvation prepared by God in Christ, which it embraces (Romans 3:28; 4:5). On the other hand, although Jesus died for all, Scripture says that \u2018whoever does not believe will be condemned\u2019 (Mark 16:16). Unbelievers forfeit the forgiveness won for them by Christ (John 8:24).\u201d\nParagraph number one speaks of objective justification. The Evangelical Lutheran Diocese of North America rejects WELS\u2019 teaching of objective justification. The website for the diocese contains \u201cArticles on Justification\u201d that offer explanation for their position."}
{"prompt": "Wedding vows", "completion": "I was wondering if couples are ever permitted to write their own Scripture-based vows with the counseling and assistance of the officiating pastor? We just were thinking about if this may be an option or not.\n\n\nThis is something you can talk about with the pastor who will be officiating at your wedding. I do not know if you are familiar with the promises that are listed in the order of \u201cChristian Marriage\u201d in Christian Worship: A Lutheran Hymnal (pages 140-141), but those promises are most certainly based on Scripture. I encourage you to look at those promises and then speak to the pastor who will be officiating at your wedding."}
{"prompt": "The baptism of the Ethiopian eunuch", "completion": "Was the Ethiopian immersed when he was baptized in Acts 8:38-39?\n\n\nThe Bible tells us that Philip and the eunuch \u201cwent down into the water\u201d (Acts 8:38) and then \u201ccame up out of the water\u201d (Acts 8:39). The Bible does not tell us if they \u201cwent down into the water\u201d to the point where the water came up to their ankles, knees, hips, shoulders or heads. We do not have that information because it is not important.\nWhat is important about baptism is that water and the word of God are applied to individuals. There is no command in Scripture how to apply the water in baptism. In no way can the account of the eunuch\u2019s baptism be used to prove the need to baptize by immersion."}
{"prompt": "Rising to the East", "completion": "Where in the Bible do I find that we rise to the East at the resurrection?\r\n\n\n\nThere is no passage in the Bible that states that, but over the years Christians have used some Bible passages as reason for burying the dead with an eastward orientation: facing the east.\nMatthew 24:27 is one of those passages. Jesus said about himself: \u201cFor as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.\u201d The thrust of Jesus\u2019 words is that his visible return on the last day will be evident to all at once\u2014like a flash of lightning that instantly illumines the sky.\nOther Bible passages with an eastward orientation that people have used for burial practices and the floor plans of churches (to face east when worshiping) are Genesis 2:8; Ezekiel 43:1-2; Isaiah 63:1; and, Zechariah 14:4.\nIt finally makes no difference in which direction a body is buried in a cemetery or how ashes from a cremation are scattered. \u201c\u2026A time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his [the Son of Man\u2019s] voice and come out\u2026\u201d (John 5:28-29).

{"prompt": "Businesses in the church", "completion": "What role or place should businesses have in our churches? I am referring specifically to the prominent place Thrivent seems to have in our church's activities (many funded in part by Thrivent action grants). This seems problematic on many levels. I am wondering if the WELS leadership has studied this practice which is common in many WELS churches. Pastors of WELS churches with whom I have spoken have expressed differing opinions about this issue, and there does not seem to be a consensus or any study they can point me to when I voice my concerns. \n\n\nAbout four years, changes in Thrivent\u2019s policies resulted in WELS issuing a statement. Here are excerpts from that statement.\n\u201cLate last year [2013], it was learned that Thrivent had permitted its members to direct their Choice dollars to Planned Parenthood, one of the largest providers of abortion services in the nation. Many conservative and confessional Lutherans expressed their dismay and even outrage that a self-described \u2018faith-based\u2019 organization would allow people to direct their funding to an abortion provider. Thrivent\u2019s response to those concerns came in the form of a new \u2018neutrality\u2019 policy, in which it stated that it would no longer permit Choice dollars to be directed to any organization whose primary purpose was to advocate for or to oppose controversial social issues such as abortion, sexual orientation, or guns. While organizations providing abortion services were no longer eligible, funding was also cut off from organizations dedicated to protecting the unborn and promoting the biblical teaching of marriage and sexuality. By adopting this policy, which Thrivent had every right to do, it clearly took the position that it is an organization that is not willing to take the correct stand on issues that we recognize to be clearly decided by the Word of God.\n\u201cAfter thorough consideration, we have concluded that, on a synodical level, to do nothing or say nothing would be a failure to make a faithful confession.\n\u201cFor that reason, our synod\u2019s relationship with Thrivent, small and informal as it has been, has come to an end. As a result, regular meetings will no longer take place, and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod will neither seek nor accept any funding from Thrivent.\n\u201cThis decision of the synod should not be understood to bind the consciences and decisions of congregations, organizations, or individuals. Individual members of Thrivent will need to make their own decisions regarding their use of Thrivent\u2019s financial services, evaluating it with the same standards that they use to evaluate and patronize any other financial services company. Members will need to make their own decision as to whether or not they continue to direct their Choice dollars to organizations. Congregations, schools, and organizations, while not compelled to refuse Choice dollars, are encouraged to consider carefully whether or not the Thrivent name should be publicly promoted in congregational or organizational literature.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "God and marriage", "completion": "Concerning marriage, how would you handle a situation in which a marriage is recognized in one country but not another? Would this constitute a valid marriage in the eyes of God? Could the couple engage in legitimate sexual activity? Or what if a government makes changes in the civil law, so that a previously recognized marriage is declared not valid?   \n\n\nThere may be a specific situation behind your questions, but I am not aware of it. Because of that, I can offer only a general response.\nThe Bible defines marriage as the union between a man and a woman (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4-6). Governments might define marriage differently and regulate it with laws, but marriage in God\u2019s eyes follows the directives of his word.\n\u201cLegitimate sexual activity\u201d is that which takes place in marriage\u2014as God, in the Bible, defines marriage."}
{"prompt": "Faith and membership", "completion": "Are members of the WELS required to accept everything the WELS teaches?\n\n\nIn This We Believe, a statement of belief of our church body, we state: \u201cWe believe\u2026that individuals through their membership in a church body commit themselves to the doctrine and practice of that church.\u201d Church membership sends the signal that the individual member\u2019s faith and the church\u2019s teachings are in harmony with one another.\nWe reflect that consistent profession of faith in our rite of Confirmation. At the Confirmation of youths and adults, there is often a question that asks the confirmands if they acknowledge that the doctrines and teachings the church presented to them are in line with God\u2019s word. It would make sense that a person who disagreed with our teachings would not want to join our church. On the other hand, an acknowledgement that our church teaches biblical doctrines accurately would welcome and also receive church membership.\nIt is possible that a person who intends to join one of our churches struggles with a particular teaching of the Bible. If the person was willing to be instructed in God\u2019s word, it is possible that the person could join the congregation under those circumstances. That would be a pastoral decision."}
{"prompt": "Jesus and temptation", "completion": "In his state of humiliation, would Jesus have been able to sin when he was tempted?\n\n\nI can point you to an article that appeared in the Wisconsin Lutheran Quarterly that succinctly addressed your question. The article is worth a read. Below are some thoughts from the conclusion of the article:\n\u201cOn the basis of a well-meant desire to affirm the authenticity of Christ\u2019s temptations some Christians have asserted that it was theoretically possible for Christ to have sinned. When the question is raised how it would have been possible for Christ to have sinned if he was truly God, the answer is usually that Jesus could have sinned only in his human nature, not in his divine nature. To claim that Jesus or his human nature could have sinned without God sinning requires that Jesus\u2019 humanity had an existence separate from God. Jesus, then, is not truly God. He is just a man inhabited or possessed by God in a special way, much like a person possessed by the devil. When we limit Christ\u2019s actions to one of his natures rather than his person, we destroy the unity of his person and end up with a Nestorian Christ, one whose two natures are just glued together like boards and which can be pulled apart. If we accept this principle, then it follows that his death was simply the death of his human nature, not the death of God\u2019s Son, that is, the death of God. Jesus certainly could not have been tempted if he had no human nature, just as he could not die without a human nature. But both of these were acts of the person, just as all his acts for our salvation were.\n\u201cFor Jesus to sin would have meant either that God sinned or that the personal union was broken. Biblical Christology allows neither of these possibilities.\u201d\nJesus was \u201ctempted in every way, just as we are\u2014yet was without sin\u201d (Hebrews 4:15). Jesus was perfect in our place. He did what we cannot do: he rejected temptation. Because we fail to reject temptation and avoid sin, Jesus suffered the punishment we deserved.\nJesus lived up to his name, which means \u201cSavior,\u201d by living a holy life in our place and suffering the punishment our sins deserved. Jesus\u2019 active obedience and passive obedience were both necessary for our salvation.\nThis link will take you to the article I cited."}
{"prompt": "\"On the third day...\"", "completion": "The Bible says that Jesus was three days in the tomb.  He died approximately at 3:00 PM on Friday and rose sometime in the morning on Sunday.  3:00 PM Friday -> Saturday -> Sunday AM is less than 2 days.  Is this a situation where we need to look at the times?  Friday, Saturday, and Sunday are three different days.  But the total time is less than two days.\n\n\nAllow me to pass along the explanation I included in When Christ Walked Among Us.\n\u201cCrucified on Friday, raised to life on Sunday. Three days or two? The answer depends on one\u2019s culture and that culture\u2019s methods for tracking time. In the Jewish way of reckoning time, it was three days. That is because of the way in which Jews determined the beginning and ending point of a day and their understanding that any part of a day equaled an entire day. Because the Genesis creation account describes the days consisting of evening and morning, the Jews understood that a day began with the evening. As sunset on Friday marked the beginning of Saturday and the Jews were rushing to remove the bodies from the crosses before twilight, that would mean Jesus\u2019 body was in the grave for a very short time on Friday. One day. His body was in Joseph\u2019s tomb all of Saturday. Two days. Sunset on Saturday denoted the commencement of Sunday. Jesus\u2019 body was in the tomb at that point. Three days. Part of one day, an entire second day and a part of the third day equaled three days according to Jewish thinking. \u2018On the third day he rose again according to the Scriptures\u2019\u201d (p. 208)."}
{"prompt": "Saving faith", "completion": "One thing I constantly battle is the thought, \"Do I really believe?\"  All I tend to see at times are my doubts, my worries about life, etc.  I confess my sins and look to Jesus' forgiveness, but it seems as soon as I'm done I go right back to what I was doing before.  I desire to grow in my faith, but I get afraid of where my faith is right now.  Paul talked about not preaching in a way that would disqualify himself from the prize.  I get scared about what Jesus sees about me right now.  Does he see a believer or someone that just speaks the right words but really doesn't have saving faith?  I get scared that I'll be rejected because my faith was fake!\n\n\n\u201cI do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!\u201d (Mark 9:24) That was the confession and request of the father who came to Jesus for help for his demon-possessed son. Many Christians can identify with that man\u2019s words. Because of the Holy Spirit\u2019s working in our hearts, we profess faith in Jesus Christ. Yet, we know and confess that there is much room for growth in our faith. Doubt and worry chip away at our trust in God. We confess those sins to God. We receive his forgiveness in faith and with joy. We resolve not to fall into those sins again, but we do.\nWhat is the antidote for doubt and worry? It is the gospel in word and sacrament that our new self treasures so much. Faith is built up\u2014and doubt and worry are correspondingly reduced\u2014when God feeds our souls with his gospel (Acts 20:32; Romans 1:16; Ephesians 3:16; 1 Thessalonians 2:13). So the same gospel that brings you the news of forgiveness for your sins of worry and doubt also deepens your faith and trust in God. That is why we want to immerse ourselves in the word of God\u2014reading it in our homes and hearing it in his house with the congregation of believers. That is why we want to be frequent guests at the Lord\u2019s Supper.\nWorry and doubt take place when we focus on ourselves and what we can and cannot do. Worry and doubt take place when we take our eyes off God, minimizing his power and love. We want to \u201cfix our eyes on Jesus\u201d always (Hebrews 12:2).\nJesus once asked his followers, \u201cWho do people say the Son of Man is?\u201d (Matthew 16:13) After receiving their answers, he asked: \u201cBut what about you? Who do you say I am?\u201d (Matthew 16:15). That is when Peter gave his beautiful confession of faith, saying that he regarded Jesus as \u201cthe Messiah, the Son of the living God\u201d (Matthew 16:16). Peter knew what was in his heart, and so did Jesus. Was Peter\u2019s faith without doubt and worries? Not at all. But his faith was saving faith because Jesus was the object of his faith.\nSimilarly, you know how you would answer Jesus\u2019 question (Matthew 16:15) if it were posed to you. (God also knows how you would answer that question.) The Holy Spirit has led you to confess Jesus as your Savior (1 Corinthians 12:3). Praise God for that! Recognize that our faith is not perfect, but the object of our faith\u2014Jesus\u2014is. Stay focused on Jesus."}
{"prompt": "Sin in the sight of God", "completion": "Are all sins equal to God? Like would stealing a package of gum be the same as murdering someone in God\u2019s eyes?\n\n\nSociety and governments make distinctions when it comes to breaking established laws. In the Bible God makes it clear that the failure to keep his laws\u2014in any way\u2014is sin.\nJesus said in the sermon on the mount, \u201cYou have heard that it was said to the people long ago, \u2018You shall not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.\u2019 But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment\u201d (Matthew 5:21-22). And, \u201cYou have heard that it was said, \u2018You shall not commit adultery.\u2019 But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart\u201d (Matthew 5:27-28).\nThe apostle John wrote: \u201cAnyone who hates a brother or sister is a murderer\u201d (1 John 3:15).\nThankfully, we have a loving Savior who has won forgiveness for the transgressions we commit in thought, word and deed, and for the sins we commit when we fail to do the good that God commands."}
{"prompt": "Pastors and sermons", "completion": "Some in our church say our pastor is preaching too much of the law and some feel as if they are being scolded. One of our council members said that if a new person attends one of our services, they won\u2019t come back; it doesn\u2019t make them feel good.\r\nI have talked to several of members and some don\u2019t like the changes that our pastor has made, but they do enjoy his services and the energy he brings. My wife and I thoroughly enjoy his sermons.\r\nHe has made us look deeper into our faith and to learn. I guess I don\u2019t see how his style would upset or scare away anyone. Can too much law be preached? Is it a minister's job to make people \u201cfeel good\u201d?  \n\n\nPart of the silent prayer I offer before preaching is that God would use me to \u201cconvict and comfort\u201d the people who are on the receiving end of my sermon. I ask that God convict them and me through the preaching of the law and comfort us through the preaching of the gospel.\nCan too much law be preached? Yes, if there is little to no gospel content in a sermon.\nIs it a minister\u2019s job to make people feel good? No. The minister\u2019s job is to be faithful in preaching God\u2019s word to people. God will take over after that. The person preaching the sermon cannot bring about reactions or feelings to his sermon.\nPastors will look to have a balance of law and gospel in their preaching, with greater emphasis on the gospel message. The gospel is \u201cgood news.\u201d There is certainly reason for joy and happiness when the good news is received in faith.\nThe apostle Paul first gave these inspired words and instructions to Timothy, a young pastor: \u201cIn the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I give you this charge: Preach the word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage\u2014with great patience and careful instruction. For the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths. But you, keep your head in all situations, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, discharge all the duties of your ministry\u201d (2 Timothy 4:1-5). Those instructions are valuable for pastors of all ages.\nGod\u2019s law can be an unpopular message with people because it stirs up consciences and makes them feel uncomfortable. Regardless, pastors are to preach God\u2019s law.\nGod\u2019s gospel can also be an unpopular message with people because they consider the idea of salvation through Jesus Christ alone an offensive, exclusive message. Regardless, pastors are to preach God\u2019s gospel.\nThe right kind of conversations about sermons in your church are the ones that take place between the members and the pastor. Do encourage your fellow members to have that kind of conversation."}
{"prompt": "Gifts of the Holy Spirit", "completion": "My wife comes from a charismatic background. Nothing unusual came out on the subject while dating, but now I am getting some \"surprises.\" She is starting to become negative on our liturgy and wants to see more \"gifts of the Holy Spirit\" again in church service, like tongue speaking, prophetic prayer and stuff like that. When I say I want to concentrate on what Jesus did for me, not gifts God has not promised to us, she gets pretty defensive. She has also claimed to have miraculously healed people through prayer on mission trips and that she has driven out demons on those same trips, so those gifts are still available to any who asks for them. Suffice it to say, this has become kind of an issue. Any advice on how to handle such claims? I am under the impression that I can't rule out her claims on healing and casting out demons because God could still actively do that stuff, if he so desired, but it is a bit of tricky subject.\n\n\nThe best course of action, of course, is for you and your wife to examine what the Bible does and does not say about spiritual gifts. If you have not studied and discussed together these sections of Scripture\u2014Romans 12:1-8; 1 Corinthians 12; Ephesians 4:11-13; 1 Peter 4:10-11\u2014it would be good for both of you to do that.\nWhen it comes to gifts of the Holy Spirit in biblical days and today, our church body makes these points in This We Believe, a statement of belief of our church body. \u201cThe Holy Spirit also equips the church with all the spiritual gifts it needs for its well-being (1 Corinthians 12:4-11). During the beginning of the New Testament era, special charismatic gifts were given to the church, such as signs, miracles, and speaking in tongues. These gifts were connected with the ministry of the apostles (2 Corinthians 12:12). There is no evidence in Scripture that we today should expect the continuation of such charismatic gifts.\u201d\nGod can do anything. As you noted, if God chooses to give a person special gifts, he can do so. The key statement in the section I passed along is the last sentence: \u201cThere is no evidence in Scripture that we today should expect the continuation of such charismatic gifts.\u201d\nOur focus is best directed on the object of our faith, Jesus Christ. The Holy Spirit\u2019s greatest gift, given to all Christians, is the gift of saving faith (1 Corinthians 12:3; Ephesians 2:8; 4:5)."}
{"prompt": "Baptism of disciples", "completion": "Were the disciples and the apostle Paul baptized?\n\n\nThe Bible does not provide a complete answer to that question. Here is what I can pass along to you. In Acts 9:18 and Acts 22:16 the apostle Paul speaks of his baptism. John 1:35-41 describes Andrew and John as disciples of John the Baptist (who then became disciples of the Lord Jesus). One would think that being disciples of John the Baptist included being the recipients of his major preparatory work for the Messiah: baptism.\nWhat we do know from the Bible is that Jesus charged his disciples to teach and baptize (Matthew 28:19-20)."}
{"prompt": "Objective justification", "completion": "What is objective justification?\n\n\nLet me pass along a few paragraphs from This We Believe, a statement of belief of our church body, that answer your question.\n\u201c4. We believe that God reconciled \u201cthe world to himself in Christ, not counting men\u2019s sins against them\u201d (2 Corinthians 5:19). We believe that Jesus is \u201cthe Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world\u201d (John 1:29). The mercy and grace of God are all-embracing; the reconciliation through Christ is universal; the forgiveness of sins has been gained as an accomplished fact for all people. Because of the substitutionary work of Christ, God has justified all people, that is, God has declared them to be not guilty. This forms the firm, objective basis for the sinner\u2019s assurance of salvation.\u201d [from III. Christ and Redemption]\n\u201c1. We believe that God has justified all sinners, that is, he has declared them righteous for the sake of Christ. This is the central message of Scripture upon which the very existence of the church depends. It is a message relevant to people of all times and places, of all races and social levels, for \u201cthe result of one trespass was condemnation for all men\u201d (Romans 5:18). All need forgiveness of sins before God, and Scripture proclaims that all have been justified, for \u201cthe result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men\u201d (Romans 5:18).\n\u201c2. We believe that individuals receive this free gift of forgiveness not on the basis of their own works, but only through faith (Ephesians 2:8,9). Justifying faith is trust in Christ and his redemptive work. This faith justifies not because of any power it has in itself, but only because of the salvation prepared by God in Christ, which it embraces (Romans 3:28; 4:5). On the other hand, although Jesus died for all, Scripture says that \u201cwhoever does not believe will be condemned\u201d (Mark 16:16). Unbelievers forfeit the forgiveness won for them by Christ (John 8:24).\u201d [from IV. Justification by Grace through Faith]"}
{"prompt": "Length of pastor's service in congregation", "completion": "How long should a pastor stay in one place? Would 18+ years be considered lengthy? Our sermons are repetitive and our spirituality is stale. \n\n\nThere is no set time or recommended time for a called worker\u2019s length of service in a particular congregation. Studies and surveys that I found indicated that 18 years of service in a congregation is longer than the average.\nIt goes without saying that there can be blessings and challenges for a pastor to serve many years in the same congregation. Some of the positives are that the pastor knows the membership well, he can become a trusted friend on whom members rely, and he provides steady leadership when there might be regular changes in lay leadership. Some of the challenges are that the pastor can be tempted to become complacent and lax in carrying out the duties and privileges of his call, he might think of the congregation as \u201cmy church,\u201d and congregational members might prove the adage that \u201cfamiliarity breeds contempt.\u201d\n\u201cHow long should a pastor stay in one place?\u201d Because of the doctrine of the call and the practice we have in our church body, pastors are not able to answer that question on their own. What I mean is that some pastors might be serving for many years in the same congregation because they have not, for many different reasons, received a call that would have them think of serving elsewhere. Or, perhaps they did receive a call to serve elsewhere and they declined the call after prayerful deliberation.\nA change in ministry can be good for the called worker and the congregations involved when there are good reasons for that change, but change for the sake of change is ill-advised.\nThe person who would benefit from comments about sermons is the pastor who preaches them.

Could  you tell us what the 2011NIV says about that in Numbers 5: 21-31, as it's a highly recommended Bible and supported and sold by Northwestern Publishing House?\n\n\nNumbers 5:21-25 does not in any way sanction abortion. The verses speak of a practice the Israelites could have used in the case of suspected unfaithfulness in marriage. The practice put the determination of guilt or innocence in the hands of the Lord. If the verdict was \u201cguilty,\u201d then there were physical consequences for the woman. Translators have rendered the Hebrew for those consequences in different ways. In the case of the NIV, the content of the footnotes of Numbers 5:22-23 (NIV84) became the text for Numbers 5:22-23 in NIV2011. The meaning appears to be that the consequences of unfaithfulness affected the part of the body involved in both adultery and fertility.\nIn no way does that section of the Bible authorize or permit abortion. The verses speak of a practice for Old Testament Israel that addressed suspected unfaithfulness. If there were adverse physical consequences for the woman, it was the result of God rendering a \u201cguilty\u201d verdict in the matter."}

{"prompt": "Denial of real presence and judgment", "completion": "Are people who don't believe in the real presence in Communion condemned to hell?  It is hard for me to believe that my very devout daughter-in-law who is Methodist is going to hell because the church that she is a member of doesn't believe in the real presence.  I have always felt that it is your faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior that is your way to heaven.\n\n\nThe King James Version translated 1 Corinthians 11:29 this way: \u201cFor he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord\u2019s body.\u201d \u201cDamnation\u201d was the translation of a Greek word that can mean \u201cjudgment\u201d or \u201ccondemnation,\u201d depending on the context.

People who \u201ceat and drink without discerning the body of Christ\u201d can bring judgment or condemnation of another kind into their lives. 1 Corinthians 11:30 lists some temporal judgments of God that the Christians in Corinth brought on themselves by \u201ceating and drinking without discerning the body of Christ.\u201d\nThe Bible teaches that Jesus\u2019 body and blood are present in, with and under the bread and wine in Holy Communion. The earthly elements do not symbolize Jesus\u2019 body and blood. The earthly elements do not turn into Jesus\u2019 body and blood, so that the earthly elements disappear. No matter what the subject matter might be, it is sinful to change or deny what God says in his word.

The pastor will accept the confession of the mouth and dare not judge a person to be impenitent on the basis of feelings the pastor has about that person\u2019s sincerity. But when impenitence has become outwardly evident, the pastor must avoid becoming a partaker of another\u2019s sin by knowingly giving communion to the openly impenitent (1 Tm 5:22). Withholding communion is then a forceful preaching of the law to call the sinner to repentance. Likewise such withholding will avoid public offense which could result from giving communion to one whose sin is public and whose impenitence is evident\u201d (p. 81).\n\u201cSuspension from Communion\u201d is a course of action, in keeping with Matthew 18, that is available for a pastor as he works with an impenitent church member. Any disciplinary action by a pastor is not to be for personal advantage but to try to lead an impenitent sinner to repentance. The motive of church discipline is always to be that of love and concern for impenitent sinners."}

I have tried many times to get my sisters to follow more of a Christian path, while I myself do not claim to be without sin and do not know how they feel in their heart about Jesus.  Is it wrong for me to want to distance myself from them and also keep my two young children away from them so they do not see the lifestyles in which they lead ?  Thank you.\n\n\nYou are rightly concerned about the influence your sisters\u2019 examples might have on your children. Children can be very impressionable. But think of it this way: when your children do have contact with your sisters, you have an opportunity to talk to your children afterwards and correct any wrong ideas they might have heard or address any wrong actions they might have seen. It could also be the case that you have conversations with your children, preparing them for contact with your sisters. Contact of some kind with your sisters might help your children grow in Christian discernment and Christian witnessing.\nAs far as you distancing yourself from your sisters, I always think of this: if Christians withdraw from people\u2019s lives, who is going to be a positive Christian witness in their lives? Who will be a salt and a light (Matthew 5:13-16) to those people? Certainly, God can use the witness of other Christians for your sisters, but your witness is already one that is present in your sisters\u2019 lives.\nYou will prayerfully determine how best to safeguard your children and show love to your sisters. God bless you and your family\u2014your immediate and extended families."}
{"prompt": "Interactions with Mormons", "completion": "I know a large number of Mormons. They are nice people except they have one major flaw, they continually make false and negative assumptions about me.  It leads to all kinds of bad vibes for both sides, not to mention difficulty in business and personal relationships.  I am at my wits end!   What can I say? What can I do?  I am tired of being constantly walked on, ignored, and having to hear them lie about me to my face.  Help.\r\n\r\n \r\n\n\n\nScripture tells us to \u201cspeak the truth in love\u201d (Ephesians 4:15). One of the Bible\u2019s claims and truths about itself is that it is \u201cis useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness\u201d (2 Timothy 3:15). It sounds like you have reason to rebuke, in love, those who are maligning you.\nAs you do that, point these individuals to Jesus.

{"prompt": "Reiki", "completion": "I have been a part of a WELS since I was a child. Recently at my childhood church my pastor's wife has started practicing Reiki, which is the massaging of others' spiritual energy to help their body, mind and spirit. I do not want to be judgemental about what she does, but I am curious if this practice aligns with the teachings of God's Word.\r\nThank you for any insight that you might have on the matter. \n\n\nPrevious responses to questions like yours included the following:\n\u201cReiki attempts to connect its practitioners more strongly to God, in order to \u2018turn on\u2019 their innate powers to heal through touch. Christian practitioners of Reiki are encouraged to precede their \u2018attunement\u2019 sessions with prayers to the Father, Son, or Holy Spirit. Or, they might find angels such as Michael or Gabriel willing to help if asked.\n\u201cMany forms of \u2018Christian meditation\u2019 are simply adaptations of Oriental meditation techniques using some Christian words or terms instead of Buddhist or Oriental terms. These may be harmless if they are simply techniques for relaxation, but they are not inherently Christian. To use these as a relaxation technique, a person could recite either Hare Krishna or Hallelujah and it would not make any difference. Simply reciting the name of Jesus repeatedly would not necessarily make this technique Christian meditation. Non-Christians could and do use Jesus\u2019 name as a mantra.\n\u201cThe Bible warns us against vain repetition, which lacks thoughtful reflection on the meaning. Oriental forms of meditation cannot be easily adopted to Christian use because they flow from a very different view of God and of how we reach him. Many Oriental meditation techniques view God as a force we harness or utilize. We view God as a person who communicated with us in revealed words.\n\u201cReal Christian meditation is thinking about the words of Scripture. We understand that we do not raise ourselves up to communicate with God by following a certain technique of meditation. God comes down to us in his Word and we meditate on what it means. Christian meditation focuses on listening to what God says in his Word not just repeating a word to relax. We have the best form of meditation\u2013meditating on God\u2019s Word. Christians can use natural relaxation methods based on physical principles. They should not become involved in techniques that are based on a false view of God or false spirituality.\n\u201cPhenomena like Reiki are typical of the New Age movement. Reiki promises supernatural power to its devotees, and it isn\u2019t particular about where the power comes from.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Catholic boyfriend", "completion": "So my boyfriend is Catholic and has some different beliefs.  I just was wondering what is the same and what is different.  I remember going over it in high school, but I do not remember it all.  I was just hoping to get some feedback to see where to go from here.\n\n\nA good read for you would be A Lutheran Looks at Catholics. It is available from Northwestern Publishing House. Your church or school library may also have a copy for you to borrow. That book will offer a good comparison of Roman Catholic Church doctrine and practice and confessional Lutheran Church doctrine and practice.\nA valuable conversation for you to have with your boyfriend is that which concerns his personal faith. What his church teaches is one thing; what he believes is another matter. The most important subject you can address with him is the way of salvation.\nThe official teaching of his church is that people ultimately enjoy salvation through faith in Jesus and human efforts. The Bible makes it very clear that people enjoy salvation through faith in Jesus Christ alone, without any effort or works of their own. \u201cFor we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law\u201d (Romans 3:28). \u201cWe who are Jews by birth and not sinful Gentiles know that a person is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no one will be justified\u201d (Galatians 2:15-16).\nGod bless your conversations as you study the truths of his word."}
{"prompt": "Lying", "completion": "Is lying ever acceptable (for example, Exodus 1:17-19 and Joshua 2:4, which are neither condoned or condemned)?\n\n\nYou have observed correctly that the Bible includes some narratives without any commentary on the appropriateness or sinfulness of people\u2019s actions.\nRegarding Exodus 1:17-19, the king of Egypt issued a decree (of killing baby boys) that directly opposed God\u2019s moral law that forbids murder. When children of God encounter conflicting commands from people and God, they side with God (Acts 5:29).\nIn the case of Joshua 2:4, children of God may sometimes wrestle with the possibility that their truthful statements will be used for harmful and ungodly purposes. While not necessarily commenting on Rahab\u2019s particular course of action in Joshua 2:4, the inspired writer to the Hebrews provides this description of her interaction with the spies: \u201cBy faith the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient\u201d (Hebrews 11:31).\nWhile Scripture alone is the source of our faith, explanations of our faith by fellow Christians can be helpful. So, in that way and within the context of your question, Martin Luther understood lying as withholding the truth from people who are entitled to it. We have to ask: was the king of Jericho entitled to the truth, since he was going to use the truth to oppose God\u2019s plan and will? Christians might answer that question in different ways.\nThe People\u2019s Bible Commentary for the book of Joshua lists (pages 35-36) some helpful truths to keep in mind regarding Rahab\u2019s actions:\n1) Her purpose and motive were in line with God\u2019s revealed will.\n2) All forms of deception are not necessarily immoral. (Cf. Exodus 1:17-19; 2:1-10)\n3) The New Testament commends her faith and refers to her actions as fruits of faith. (Hebrews 11:31; James 2:25)\n4) She was new to the faith and needed to determine a godly course of action quickly.\n5) The cultural practices of her day meant looking out for guests.\n6) We could always do something better with the benefit of hindsight. If our course of action is wrong, we rejoice that we have a Savior who was perfect in our place and has paid the debt of our sin and guilt."}
{"prompt": "Fellowship and leadership", "completion": "While trying to understand our fellowship principles, I've read several questions regarding the participation of people of other denominations or synods in services such as funerals. Some asked whether they could sing, or even play the organ for services. The answers trended toward, \"No, as they would be leading the services and could cause confusion over what we believe concerning scriptural matters.\" I'm okay with that, but it leads me to another question about the roles of women in our church. If women aren't supposed to lead our services, how can they play the organ, or solo singing a hymn? Or are they assisting the pastor as opposed to leading?\n\n\nIt looks like you are understanding correctly that your questions address two different subjects: church fellowship and leadership. The \u201cparticipation of people of other denominations or synods in services such as funerals\u201d is a matter of church fellowship. That is true whether the individuals involved are male or female.\nMen and women of our fellowship who offer assistance in the worship service do so in keeping with the biblical roles of loving head and loving helper (1 Corinthians 11:3)."}
{"prompt": "Types of Christ", "completion": "When Abraham was about to kill Isaac as a sacrifice, God provided a ram to be sacrificed in place of Isaac. I have heard in more than one sermon that the ram was a type of Christ. Is this correct, or would this be allegory?\n\n\nWe often define a \u201ctype of Christ\u201d as someone or something that points ahead to Jesus Christ and his redeeming work. With a \u201ctype,\u201d the Old Testament in some way will prefigure the person and work of Christ, and the New Testament will provide enough information to see how that type finds its fulfillment in Jesus Christ.\nIn the biblical account you referenced (Genesis 22), a ram became the sacrifice offered to God instead of Isaac. The prophet Isaiah described the Messiah\u2019s approach to his suffering for our sins this way: \u201cHe was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before its shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth\u201d (Isaiah 53:7).\nWhen Jesus embarked on his public ministry, John the Baptist said of him, \u201cLook, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!\u201d (John 1:29)\nThe substitionary sacrifice in Genesis 22 points us ahead to Jesus\u2019 substitionary sacrifice for the sins of the world (1 John 2:2).\nThe sermons you heard contained accurate biblical interpretation. An allegorical approach to that account from Genesis 22 would turn objects like the fire and the knife into other items."}
{"prompt": "Ushering", "completion": "I am looking for answers to see why women have not been allowed to usher during church services, but now it seems like there is talk going around it is OK?\r\nIf it is OK now, why not before?\n\n\nBecause Scripture does not mention a service role like ushering, we find ourselves in the area of Christian freedom and the application of biblical principles.\nWhat is helpful for your answering your question is knowing the job description of ushers: what are the responsibilities of ushers? Is it greeting worshipers, distributing service folders, assisting with the offering and taking part in the dismissal of worshipers? One has to ask: is there any authoritative responsibility in those actions that would violate the biblical principles of loving head and loving helper (Genesis 2:18; 1 Corinthians 11:3; 1 Timothy 2:12)?\nIn the past (and perhaps still today, according to their job description in some churches), ushers had the responsibility of being the \u201cgatekeeper\u201d for the congregation\u2019s close communion practice. In that way they assisted the pastor and the board of elders in controlling who would be guests at the Lord\u2019s Supper. Today, many congregations have other means of addressing the implementation of their close communion practice, so there is often not any authoritative role for ushers in that part of the worship service. Again, a key is understanding what our congregations are asking and directing ushers to do. If the responsibilities for ushers change, the practice can also change.\nIf you are interested in pursuing this further, this subject is one of many discussed in more detail in A Bible Study on Man and Woman in God\u2019s World. It is available from Northwestern Publishing House."}
{"prompt": "Fellowship principles and schools", "completion": "I recently visited a local WELS area high school. While I was there, they were allowing students who were Missouri Synod to lead devotions and allowing people who were Baptist to lead devotions in a religion course. I know the WELS has the stance that we can\u2019t worship with people who we are not in fellowship with. So my question is, why is this okay and allowed at a WELS high school, but yet I was told this isn\u2019t okay? Why is there an exception to doctrine for WELS high schools? Why are the called workers allowing this to happen?\n\n\nYou are aware of a situation of which I am not. The proper course of action is for you to ask these questions of the officials of the school in question.\nSome four years, WELS Conference of Presidents (COP) approved materials that were produced by a fellowship study committee. The materials were designed to help schools study the biblical principles of fellowship and apply them to their unique settings. The COP encouraged schools to make use of these resources."}

Thank you for your time.\n\n\n\u201cIf your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault, just between the two of you\u201d (Matthew 18:15). Jesus\u2019 words tell us that it is appropriate, important and necessary that we speak to a fellow Christian who sins and needs rebuke. The rest of Jesus\u2019 words (Matthew 18:16-18) provide a course of action for possible follow up.\nFollowers of the Lord in New Testament times enjoy a great amount of freedom when it comes to worshiping the Lord. There are no prescribed forms of worship. The general guidance that the Bible provides is that our worship of God be offered in a \u201cfitting and orderly way\u201d (1 Corinthians 14:40). Personal preferences for worship forms cannot be upheld as the will of God.\nYou can remind your brother in the faith to refrain from judgments and condemnations that are unwarranted.

{"prompt": "Loving all people", "completion": "\"By this shall all people know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.\" (John 13:35) Is St. John referring only to believers with the command here and in 1 John? Is there Scripture to support this? Or what Scriptures support that love by Christians is to extend to every human being?\n\n\nThe love of Christians for one another is important, but Christians are not to limit their love to one another.\n\u201cWhat Scriptures support that?\u2019 The second table of the law instructs us to \u201clove your neighbor as yourself\u201d (Mark 12:31). Jesus\u2019 Parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37) makes clear that our neighbor is our fellow human being. Galatians 6:10 instructs us: \u201cTherefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.\u201d Jesus tells Christians to \u201clove your enemies\u201d (Luke 5:44). The Great Commission (Matthew 28:18-20) is based on love for all people: God loves all people, and he wants us to show love to all people by sharing the gospel with them.\nOne day during his earthly ministry Jesus spoke of the limited love of the Pharisees (Luke 14:12-14). In the name of religion (their own religion), those people restricted their love to one another. Jesus instructed them to \u201cbranch out\u201d with their acts of love. Scripture has that same instruction and encouragement for children of God.\nAs Christians, we are to love all people. We keep that in perspective with this truth of Scripture: \u201cWe love because he first loved us\u201d (1 John 4:19)."}
{"prompt": "12-step programs", "completion": "Is it permissible to attend a twelve-step program such as AA or FA (Food Addicts)?\n\n\nAs a church body, we have concerns about the religious aspects of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). In step number 2 of The Twelve Steps, there is acknowledgement of a \u201cPower greater than ourselves.\u201d Participants in AA are free to define who or what that Power is. In step number 3 there is reference to \u201cGod as we understood him.\u201d Participants in AA are free to define God however they understand him. Step number 11 uses the same wording: \u201cGod, as we understood him.\u201d Once again, participants in AA are free to understand God however they like.\nAs Christians, we know that  is not like selecting an answer for a multiple choice question where all the choices are equally valid. In the Bible God explains clearly who he is. He is a Triune God: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. AA fails to provide clear testimony to the truth of God\u2019s Word. And while AA provides opportunities for Christians to state their beliefs, circumstances can be such where Christian witness is absent much more than present.\nJoint prayer at AA meetings is another concern. Scripture directs us to refrain from activities like prayer when we are with others who do not share a common belief (Romans 16:17).\nIn light of all this, WELS members have been able to participate in AA by not taking part in joint prayer. In addition, they have recognized the concerns in the three steps mentioned previously and have not, by their words and actions, endorsed the idea that people may define God however they want.\nNo doubt you can see that we need to be cautious if we are considering utilizing AA. A conversation with one\u2019s pastor about the experiences can be very helpful. Finally, be aware that Christian Family Solutions is able to provide help without the concerns of AA that have been mentioned.\nFood Addicts (FA) adapts AA\u2019s Twelve Steps and includes similar references to \u201cGod\u201d in their Twelve Steps. In FA\u2019s \u201cTwelve Traditions\u201d there is this statement: \u201cFor our group purpose there is but one ultimate authority \u2014a loving God as He may express Himself in our group conscience.\u201d As group participants are left to define God, cautions similar to AA are in place."}
{"prompt": "Second baptism", "completion": "I was born and raised WELS, but the question I have is regarding my nephew and godson who was baptized ELCA 20 years ago. He has been very involved in his campus ministry in college and has recently decided to be baptized again. As a WELS member, I understand that we believe in one baptism and faith in Jesus for salvation. What reasoning would this campus ministry be giving to this young adult to be baptized again, and is there spiritual damage they are causing by doing this? \r\nMy nephew felt that his infant baptism was his parents choosing a faith for him as a child, and this baptism is his choosing the faith he would have for the remainder of his years. I'm just concerned that he is making this more about him and not what it is truly about, the power of the Holy Spirit in his life.\n\n\nSince I do not know the campus ministry in question, I can only guess that it denies infant baptism.\nEven though there is no specific command in the Bible to baptize infants, the Bible provides three compelling reasons for baptizing infants. 1) Children are part of \u201call nations\u201d (Matthew 28:19), the object of the church\u2019s \u201cbaptizing\u201d and \u201cteaching.\u201d \u201cNations\u201d are made up of people of all ages, including infants. If baptism were to be withheld from infants, this section of Scripture would have been the place for that instruction. 2) Because children are sinful by nature, they have a great need for the forgiveness of sins (Psalm 51:5; John 3:5-6). 3) We baptize children and infants because they can believe (Matthew 18:6; Luke 18:15-17; 2 Timothy 3:15). They can believe because God is the one who creates faith in people through the gospel (Hebrews 12:2; Romans 10:17). Faith is not a human decision. God is the one who creates faith, and he can do that in young and old alike. People of all ages are on the receiving end of the Holy Spirit\u2019s converting power (Acts 2:39).\nThe spiritual harm of another baptism\u2014as in the circumstances you described\u2014is that the person\u2019s action can amount to a rejection of what the Bible says about the power of God in infant baptism and a denial of who is responsible for the creation of Christian faith.\nIt would be good for you to explain to your nephew that he was not baptized into a Christian denomination. He was baptized into the Christian Church.\nYour nephew can be thankful that, when he was an infant, his parents took the initiative and baptized him. Imagine the parents of a sick child saying to themselves, \u201cLet\u2019s wait until our child is older and see if he or she wants to go to the doctor and receive medical help.\u201d What poor parenting that would be. Parents who love their children and know what they need do what is best for them. That is true whether we are talking about attending to the physical needs of their children or their spiritual needs.\nChurches that deny baptism is a means of grace often turn baptism into a profession a faith on the part of the individual. If your nephew was confirmed in his Lutheran church, it was then that he made a public profession of faith."}

God could have created a world in which sin could never have existed. He chose not to do that, and he does not offer explanation in the Bible on his actions (nor does he need to). \u201cOur God is in heaven; he does whatever pleases him\u201d (Psalm 115:3).\nWhen I am confronted by mysteries like this, I think of Romans 11:33-36: \u201cOh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!

Or who has been his counselor?\u201d\n\u201cWho has ever given to God, that God should repay them?\u201d For from him and through him and for him are all things. To him be the glory forever! Amen.\u201d\nYou and I do not know what is in God\u2019s mind unless he tells us. What he does tell us is that, \u201cAs the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts\u201d (Isaiah 55:9). We really aren\u2019t to be surprised if we can\u2019t understand God and his ways completely.\nWhat we do know with certainty is that God met evil head-on in the person of his Son, Jesus Christ. Jesus defeated Satan by overcoming all his temptations and by rising from the dead after offering his life as a sacrifice for sin. What we also know with certainty is that God will one day remove evil completely from the lives of his followers (Revelation 20-22).\n\u201cNow to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever!

{"prompt": "Tuition discounts", "completion": "Why do called workers' children get such a break on tuition both in grade school, high schools, etc.?  There are many instances where the spouse works and together make a very nice salary, more than members paying full tuition. \n\n\nThat is really a question you would want to ask of administrative personnel at schools where such discounts exist. (As a called worker, I never was the beneficiary of discounted tuition for my children.)\nI imagine that if churches and schools designed a tuition break for their called workers, it was in consideration of the called workers\u2019 salary only. Employment and accompanying salary on the part of called workers\u2019 spouses is an entirely separate matter.\nPerhaps a tuition break like you mentioned represents the attitude of a congregation giving \u201cdouble honor\u201d to its called workers (1 Timothy 5:17). If that is the case, neither you nor I want to begrudge that."}
{"prompt": "Employment at church", "completion": "I've heard many times that Christians want to be cautious when purchasing things that could directly support the advancement of a false religion (e.g. Girl Scout cookies), especially if they are aware of where the proceeds are going to. Are there any concerns about that when seeking employment? Is there anything wrong if a WELS Christian served a non-denominational or ELCA church as a custodian, secretary, or groundskeeper?\n\n\nAllow me to pass along a response provided to a similar question: A Christian may and often does seek or accept employment that in some indirect ways benefits heterodox groups as well as unbelieving communities. Seldom is this kind of activity an expression of doctrinal fellowship, nor is it perceived by people as that. A person\u2019s conscience might factor into this, as we do not want to sin against conscience (Romans 14:23). Or if there are weak brothers and sisters who might be confused or misunderstand the arrangement, we want to be ready to explain and clarify and instruct \u2014 and possibly refrain from exercising our Christian freedom for a time for their sake. But we don\u2019t want to unnecessarily limit our ability to love our neighbor and serve our neighbor as part of our vocation if we are able to do so without compromising the truth."}
{"prompt": "Confirmation practices", "completion": "What are the criteria/requirements for youth confirmation in the WELS Synod? (i.e. age, grade, years of instructions)  Does the pastor and/or principal determine when each individual child is ready to be confirmed?  Would a public school 7th grader be considered ready for confirmation?  Also, is it up the each pastor to decide if there is a public confirmation examination or reading of an essay they have written?  This year there was only the Rite of Confirmation.\n\n\nThe Bible of course does not speak of the rite of confirmation or the practice of public examination. It speaks of training children in God\u2019s word (Psalm 78:1-8; Proverbs 22:6; 2 Timothy 3:14-16), confessing Jesus Christ as Savior (Matthew 10:32), examining ourselves before receiving the Lord\u2019s Supper (1 Corinthians 11:28) and partaking of the Lord\u2019s Supper often (1 Corinthians 11:25). Established in Christian freedom, confirmation\u2014the rite and the formal course of instruction that precedes it\u2014addresses these important areas.\nA common practice in our church body associates the time of youth confirmation with the completion of elementary education. There are no biblical mandates or synodical rules that demand this practice. As Christians who walk together in a synod, we recognize practices that can offer uniformity and orderliness, but we also acknowledge differing practices based on local circumstances. Confirmation and examination practices are ultimately the responsibility of local congregations and their pastors.\nMuch has been written about our confirmation practices. Following are excerpts from an article in Forward in Christ a number of years ago:\n\u201cLutherans have never had a consistent confirmation practice. In fact, only in the last century or two has confirmation become a nearly universal practice among Lutherans. Martin Luther did not use a rite of confirmation because he wanted to avoid any suggestion that confirmation was a sacrament. He wanted to distance himself from the Roman Catholic practice. Luther placed his focus on the careful instruction of the youth in the basic teachings of the Bible\u2026Nevertheless Lutherans began practicing a rite of confirmation even during Luther\u2019s lifetime. The great Reformer did not object to it so long as people recognized that it was neither a sacrament commanded by God nor necessary to be observed.\n\u201cConfirmation is intended to give those who have received basic instruction in the truths of God\u2019s Word the opportunity publicly to confess their faith before the church. The rite informs the congregation that these catechumens have sufficient scriptural understanding and spiritual maturity to partake of the Lord\u2019s Supper.\n\u201cThe importance of confirmation does not lie in the rite itself. The focus must always be on the means of grace..The ceremony stresses the importance of Christian instruction and continuing in God\u2019s Word. It points to the glorious gift our Savior gives us in his Supper. It reminds us that he gives us his very body and blood to assure us of his forgiveness and to strengthen our faith. Confirmation is meaningless if viewed apart from the instruction in God\u2019s truth given in preparation for the rite. This instruction imparts the basic teachings of Christianity and provides the knowledge necessary for growth toward Christian maturity. Catechism class lays a foundation upon which the Christian will build for a lifetime.\n\u201cGod has commanded us to instruct children and adults in his truth. He has not commanded us to have a rite like confirmation. The rite is valuable only so long as people understand its purpose and recognize the importance of continued instruction and participation in worship and the Lord\u2019s Supper. But when confirmation is understood and practiced properly, it can be very meaningful.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Christians and tragedies", "completion": "Why do some Christian families tend to suffer so much more than others? My best friend has gone through so much in losing family to cancer and accidents and now tonight just lost her son who just married a year ago and just became a father. Her family has lost her brother and sister.  Does God make us suffer from our ancestors evil?\r\n\n\n\nThere is no question that God\u2019s ways can be mysterious to us (Isaiah 55:9; Romans 11:33-34). For the child of God, God\u2019s ways always have his or her good in mind (Romans 8:28).\nThe account of Job (especially chapters one and two) illustrates that the tragedies a child of God might encounter in life are not punishments for sin\u2014neither ours nor our ancestors. Jesus was punished for our sins, and \u201cthere is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus\u201d (Romans 8:1).\n\u201cDoes God make us suffer for our ancestors\u2019 evil?\u201d In the case of Christians, the answer is \u201cno.\u201d Exodus 20:5 (\u201cI, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me\u2026\u201d) speaks of the actions God can take in the case of families who reject him generation after generation.\nContinue to keep your friend in your prayers.

{"prompt": "\"Prophecy\" in 1 Corinthians 12-14", "completion": "What is prophecy according to I Corinthians 12-14?\n\n\n\u201cProphecy\u201d can have a wider and narrower definition. The narrower definition describes the role of Old Testament prophets: men who received messages from God, sometimes concerning the revelation of future events, and then relayed them to people. The wider definition speaks of followers of God in general communicating the messages of God\u2019s law and gospel to others. It is that wider definition of prophecy that we see in 1 Corinthians 12-14.\nIn 1 Corinthians 12-14 the apostle Paul contrasts prophecy with speaking in tongues/speaking in other languages. Because the Corinthian Christians placed such a high value on speaking in tongues/speaking in other languages, the apostle Paul demonstrated the greater benefit of communicating the messages of God\u2019s word in a language that people can understand (1 Corinthians 14:3, 24-25)."}

The Bible makes it clear that those who have the faith of Abraham\u2014trusting in the promised Messiah, Jesus Christ\u2014are the Israel of God (Galatians 6:16; Romans 9:8). When the Bible speaks of a \u201cnew Jerusalem\u201d (Revelation 21:2), it does so in symbolic terms as the eternal home of God\u2019s people.

Definitely more \u201creligious\u201d than me. I\u2019m working on my own faith and making that a bigger part of my life, but talking about marriage scares me because I feel like we have vast religious differences despite both being Lutheran.

{"prompt": "The establishment of churches", "completion": "So, I have been studying church history lately, and it is quite obvious that the Catholic Church was the first church that Jesus established. So, since that is the case, in Matthew 16:18 it says that the gates of hell will not overcome the church. Well, we Lutherans would say that the devil deceived the Catholic Church, but if he did, then wouldn\u2019t that make Jesus a liar? I know he isn\u2019t a liar, by the way, but this is just kind of making me think of joining the Catholic faith. I mean Jesus did establish the Catholic Church on Peter, and Protestants were established by men like Martin Luther, John Calvin, Zwingli, etc. Can you please help with this?\n\n\nThe best help I can offer is correcting some of the information in the text of your question.\nJesus did not establish the Roman Catholic Church. Jesus\u2019 words in Matthew 16:18 make it very clear that he was building his church on the confession of faith that he is \u201cthe Messiah, the Son of the living God,\u201d and not on a person like the apostle Peter.\nJesus\u2019 words in Matthew 16:18 do make it very clear that Satan and his forces will not be able to overthrow Christ and his Church. Revelation 20:7-10 describes Satan\u2019s final and eternal defeat.\nWas the origin of the Lutheran Church connected to Martin Luther? Certainly. But it was not Luther\u2019s intent to start a new church named after him. When the Roman Catholic Church excommunicated Luther, the reformer had no other church with which to affiliate. The establishment of another church was inevitable.\nKeep in mind that, as Lutheran Christians, we do not regard Martin Luther or his writings as foundational to our faith. Scripture alone is the source of our faith and doctrine. The recent 500th anniversary celebration of the Lutheran Reformation highlighted that truth again and again.\nLuther\u2019s Protest could be a good read for you. It explains the Reformation very well and keeps Luther in proper perspective. The book is available in print and digital versions.\nMost of all, hold on\u2014in faith\u2014to the Bible\u2019s teaching that salvation is God\u2019s free gift to people through Spirit-worked faith (Romans 3:28; Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:5-6)."}
{"prompt": "Relying on God", "completion": "I\u2019m reading a book about the women  in the Bible:  Sarah, Hannah,  The book is about waiting patiently for God\u2019s will. It says that God wants nothing more than for us to let go of our projects, our schemes, and our self-sufficiency and allow Him to work. So my question is, what is considered our own self-sufficiency? If I\u2019m looking for a job and sending out my resume like crazy, am I acting on my own self-sufficiency? If I buy a lottery ticket, is that a scheme and not trusting the Lord to provide for my needs? Need clarification please. \n\n\nIt is always helpful\u2014and fair to the author of a book\u2014to consider a passage in its context, but I will work with what you have provided.\nBy definition and in the context of your question, self-sufficiency is the idea that we do not need God because we can fend for ourselves. That idea of course is completely untruthful. When it comes to our connection to God, the apostle Paul stated the truth when he said, \u201cFor in him we live and move and have our being\u201d (Acts 17:28). We would not have life\u2014or anything in it\u2014if it were not for God\u2019s power and love.\nAs Christians, we reflect our reliance on God in ways that Scripture directs. In his epistle, James spoke of making plans but finally committing those plans to God\u2019s wisdom and will (James 4:13-15). The book of Proverbs (3:5) directs us to \u201cTrust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding.\u201d In the sermon on the mount (Matthew 6:31-33), Jesus instructed his followers to put him first in life and trust that he would provide for all their needs.\nSeeking employment by sending out resumes does not necessarily demonstrate a lack of trust in God or a self-sufficient attitude. It is one matter if a person thinks that gaining employment is entirely up to him or her, but it is quite another matter if a person is diligent in making contacts for potential employment, while trusting in God to provide.\nRegarding the purchase of a lottery ticket, the motive behind the action is important. Is the purchase prompted by greed, a lack of contentment or the thought that \u201cI have to provide for myself because God is not doing a good job of doing that\u201d? How does the purchase line up with being a faithful manager of God\u2019s possessions? Those are questions to consider.\nI hope these thoughts have provided some clarification. God bless."}

When God has not revealed specific information, we really cannot speak for him. This has meaning when it comes to trying to understand the \u201cWhys\u201d and \u201cWhy nots\u201d of life.\nGod does not explain\u2014nor does he have to explain\u2014the ways in which he controls the events of the world for the good of his church. Because we lack God\u2019s specific explanation for specific events in life, his ways can seem mysterious to us (Isaiah 55:9; Romans 11:33-34). Still, Christians cling to God in faith, trusting that he has their overall good in mind (Romans 8:28).\nYou might find it worthwhile to read a \u201cLight for our path\u201d column that addressed a question that was similar to yours.

I know Peter\u2019s name in Greek means rock or stone, so does that mean there is some connection with Peter and the Church in Matthew 16:18 when Jesus says that on this rock I will build my church?\n\n\nJesus gave Simon an additional name when they first met (John 1:42). The connection between Peter and Jesus\u2019 church in Matthew 16:18 is that Jesus said he was going to build his church on the confession of faith that Peter made: that Jesus is \u201cthe Messiah, the Son of the living God.\u201d\nThe Greek word for Peter is \u201cpetros.\u201d The Greek word for the rock on which Jesus was going to build his church is \u201cpetra.\u201d Jesus\u2019 words make it clear that he was building his church on the confession that he is Savior\u2014and not on the person who made such a confession."}
{"prompt": "Cain and Abel", "completion": "Were Cain and Abel twins?\n\n\nPeople have sometimes thought that the brothers were twins because the wording for Cain\u2019s birth differs from the wording for Abel\u2019s birth. In the case of Cain\u2019s birth, the Bible states that \u201cEve became pregnant and gave birth to Cain\u201d (Genesis 4:1). In the case of Abel\u2019s birth, the Bible omits the phrase that Eve became pregnant and simply says: \u201cLater she gave birth to his brother Abel\u201d (Genesis 4:2). With that difference in mind, some have taken \u201cLater\u201d to mean minutes and not months or years.\nThat understanding is possible, but the wording does not limit the interpretation to that meaning. There are other instances in Scripture where the births of children are recorded without explicitly stating that their mothers became pregnant. Some examples are Genesis 4:20, 22, 25. With these thoughts in mind, the Bible does not provide a definitive answer."}
{"prompt": "Women and voters' assemblies", "completion": "If the construct of a voters' assembly is adiaphora, as in there is no explicit biblical basis for this practice, why is it that the idea of women participating in these positions is seemingly impossible? I understand the spiritual authority aspect, however, as an adult, unmarried female my opinion does not have a way to be heard, due to my inability to attend these voters meetings (not true of every congregation). Applying general passages to a very specific system does not seem like the logical basis to create a system. Could not the women of a church better understand the needs of a church from a different perspective than that of a man? If I, as an unmarried female, wish to raise a concern about who the congregation is calling, for example, how could I go about that in the current system, besides going to my pastor outside of a voters' meeting? This situation then removes my concerns from the congregation, which could have helped raise discussion to help choose the person best fitted to the needs of said congregation. This topic has often troubled me, and I would like more explanation as to why we practice what we do.\n\n\nProviding adequate detail in the responses to your questions can be challenging in a forum like this. So, perhaps the best way I can help is by steering you to a couple of Bible study resources that congregations can use as they address questions like yours.\nThe first is A Bible Study on Man and Woman in God\u2019s World. The second is Heirs Together of God\u2019s Gracious Gift.\nThe resources apply Scripture passages to congregational life that we have, in Christian freedom, developed today.\nAs congregations apply the scriptural roles of loving head and loving helper (Genesis 2:18; 1 Corinthians 11:3, 8; 1 Timothy 2:11-13) to the context of voters\u2019 assemblies, they want to do so with love and respect for one another. That certainly means trying to receive input from those who are not part of the voting process.\u00a0 God bless your study of this topic."}
{"prompt": "Cremation vs. burial", "completion": "What does the Bible say about cremation instead of burial? If I choose cremation, will I still go to heaven?\n\n\nScripture is silent on the issue of cremation. It is a matter of personal preference when it comes to burial or cremation.\nThere was a time not that long ago when some voices in the Christian church cautioned against cremation. In a day and age when some unbelievers utilized cremation as a way to defy God (\u201cLet\u2019s see if this supposed God can put me back together some day.\u201d), some Christians advocated that followers of the Lord not cremate their bodies, so as not to be associated with unbelievers or an activity of unbelievers.\nThat type of taunting has largely disappeared, so Christians today who make use of cremation are not likely to be confused with unbelievers. The choice of cremation over burial often includes ecological, economical and convenience factors. In the end, cremation essentially speeds up the process that occurs with burial: \u201cDust you are and to dust you will return\u201d (Genesis 3:19). Regardless of cremation or burial, \u201cAll who are in their graves will hear his [Jesus\u2019] voice and come out\u201d (John 5:28-29).\nChoosing cremation over burial will not affect your eternal relationship with God. Faith in Jesus saves (Mark 16:16), not the way our bodies are treated after death. Keep focused on Jesus! (Hebrews 12:2)"}
{"prompt": "Gathering for worship", "completion": "I have a co-worker who said you don't have to go to a church service to believe in God.  I replied that believing in God, you would want to gather together with like -minded believers to worship.  What passages could I use to reinforce my position?\n\n\nYou could use sections of Scripture like Psalm 84, Psalm 122:1 and Hebrews 10:23-25 to demonstrate that it is God\u2019s will that his children gather together in his house for worship.\nWe want to recognize that our sinful nature wants nothing to do with God or his word. Our sinful nature rebels at any opportunity to worship with fellow Christians or read the Bible on our own. On the other hand, our new self agrees with the psalmist: \u201cI rejoiced with those who said to me, \u2018Let us go to the house of the Lord\u2019\u201d (Psalm 122:1). In our daily walk of faith we strive to put down the sinful nature through repentance and to build up the new self through God\u2019s word. Worshiping the Lord in church, receiving the Lord\u2019s Supper, reading and studying God\u2019s Word individually and with others will build up our new self and strengthen our desire to worship the Lord in church.\u00a0 God bless your conversations with your co-worker."}
{"prompt": "Clergy vestments", "completion": "Why and when did the clergy go from the black robe to the white robe and stoles?  Years ago the pastor wore black, as it was a sign of humility.  What is the thought process of this change?\n\n\nChristian Worship: Manual, the companion book to Christian Worship: A Lutheran Hymnal, has a helpful section of information (pages 95-104) that addresses your question. Here are some excerpts:\n\u201cDuring the first four centuries after Christ, pastors did not have the custom of wearing special clothes for worship\u2026The alb became the customary worship vestment only as public worship became more formal and ceremonial, sometime around the fifth century.\n\u201c\u2026The garment the medieval pastor would have worn when he came to church was the street attire of his own era, the cassock\u2026Since the clergy were also the teachers at the schools and universities, the cassock was what teachers and professors wore when they taught. One might compare the cassock to our modern sport jacket and slacks, or to a pinstripe suit\u2026Only under the influence of the Reformed (who rejected almost all of the church\u2019s historic worship legacy) did the \u2018Geneva\u2019 or academic robe come to replace the alb as the worship vestment.\n\u201c\u2026Those who rejected the historic worship vestments, first in Germany and later in America, were aligned more often with the Calvinists, Pietists, and Rationalists than they were with the orthodox Lutherans\u2026The Rationalists were decidedly anti-authoritarian\u2026Their clergy dressed in the black academic robe not because it was a worship vestment, but because it was not a worship vestment. Like many Protestants today, they wore the everyday professional garb of the medieval scholar and the modern magistrate, the Geneva gown.\u201d\nWhen it comes to the color of the pastors\u2019 vestments, Christian Worship: Manual, explains the significance of liturgical colors. \u201cWhite: color of the godhead and eternity; color of the robe of the glorified Christ and of the angels and saints in heaven; color of perfection, joy, purity.\u201d \u201cBlack: the absence of color; symbolic of death.\u201d\n\u201cThe stole is traditionally reserved for those who hold the office of the pastoral ministry.\u201d\nIn all of this, we want to keep Christian freedom in mind. God has neither commanded nor prohibited the use of vestments like these."}
{"prompt": "Gambling", "completion": "Why is sin being viewed differently at churches, even in WELS churches, in today's world? It is accepted. God plainly states sin is sin and he hates it.  The whole idea of adiophora has become for many pastors and religious leaders an excuse to sin. The Bible may not say anything about gambling being wrong, but it is an abuse of God's money, given as a gift and God wants that money to be managed properly.  To say it is okay to gamble for whatever reason is to say that God doesn't care how we use his gifts. \n\n\nWhen it comes to adiaphora (those things that God has neither commanded nor forbidden), people might reach different, conscientious decisions on concluding whether something is right or wrong. The early Christians in Rome (diet and special days, Romans 14) and Corinth (meat sacrificed to idols, I Corinthians 8) illustrate that.\nThe Bible does not specifically address gambling, but does speak of greed and covetousness that can easily and often be associated with gambling. In addition, the Bible instructs us not to squander the resources that God has entrusted to us, but rather use them to provide for our families (1 Timothy 5:8), to pay taxes (Romans 13:6-7), to give back to the Lord and his church (1 Corinthians 16:2) and to help those who have needs (1 John 3:17). \u201cGambling for whatever reason\u201d is not a course of action we advocate."}
{"prompt": "Churches and safety", "completion": "In today's current climate, is it appropriate for a pastor and congregational leaders to be vocal supporters of the NRA, host trainings for current/potential gun owners on church property, and post signs stating that the church property is protected by armed security? Should we be portraying our church to our community as a \"Pro-Gun Church\" and isolating members/visitors that disagree politically? How can this be addressed without hurting anyone's feelings? Thanks!\n\n\nThese are matters that are best addressed at the congregational level. Your congregation might be in a rural setting where there is a long-established culture of hunting; it might be in an urban setting where there is a high crime rate.\nAs churches and schools react to the shootings that have taken place across our country recently, they are interested in the safety of their constituents. How to keep people safe and vigilant is where discussions and plans can vary.\nAll I can say in general about your questions is that congregations will want to apply their regular decision-making policies and procedures to this matter. They will want to see if any proposed action aligns with the mission of their congregation (their mission statement). They will seek input from congregational members\u2014especially those who are not part of the decision-making process. They will be interested in listening to and addressing the concerns of those individuals whose opinions did not prevail. They will want to know if any proposed actions could benefit from legal review. These are some thoughts that congregations regularly keep in mind as they attend to their business matters and which can be applied to your situation."}
{"prompt": "Assemblies of God teachings", "completion": "What teachings of the Assemblies of God churches do not agree with our teachings?\n\n\nAn answer to a previous, similar question pointed out these differences:\n1) The Assemblies of God churches teach that faith is a condition of salvation rather than teaching that faith is the way God has chosen for us to receive salvation. The implication is that an unconverted, sinful human being must \u201cdecide\u201d for Christ. WELS teaches that people by nature are dead in their transgressions and sin and therefore have no ability to decide for Christ (Ephesians 2:1, 5). We do not choose Christ, rather he chose us (John 15:16).\n2) The Assemblies of God churches teach that Baptism and Holy Communion are ordinances whereby Christians declare to the world that they have died with Christ and share in the divine nature. They do not believe that the sacraments are means of grace through which the Holy Spirit works to create or strengthen faith. They deny the Real Presence in the Lord\u2019s Supper. They insist that the only legitimate way to perform baptism is by immersion. WELS teaches that baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper are means of grace through which the Holy Spirit works to create or strengthen faith (Titus 3:4-7, John 3:5-6, 1 Peter 3:21, Matthew 26:26-28). We believe that Christ\u2019s true body and blood are truly present in the Lord\u2019s Supper (Matthew 26:26-28, 1 Corinthians 11:23-29). The Bible does not mandate the mode of applying the water of baptism.\n3) The Assemblies of God churches teach premillennialism. They believe that Christ will return and reign physically, visibly, and politically for 1,000 years on earth. WELS rejects the teaching that Jesus will return to establish a political reign here on earth (John 19:36, Romans 14:17, Colossians 1:13-14).\n4) The Assemblies of God churches are a perfectionist church body. According to the official website of the Assemblies of God, they believe that \u201cby the power of the Holy Ghost we are able to obey the command: \u2018Be ye holy, for I am holy.\u2019\u201d Holiness/perfectionist church bodies often seem to make rules where God hasn\u2019t and to call things sinful which God has not forbidden. WELS teaches that, although we will strive for Christian perfection, we will not attain it in this life (Romans 7:14-25, Philippians 3:12). We are careful not to call things sinful which God has not called sinful (1 Corinthians 10:23-33, Romans 14:1-23).\n5) The Assemblies of God churches believe that every believer is entitled to \u201cbaptism in the Holy Spirit\u201d (an experience separate from water baptism) with the initial evidence of speaking in tongues. They also practice faith healing. They teach that such \u201cdivine healing is an integral part of the gospel. Deliverance from sickness is provided for in the atonement, and is the privilege of all believers.\u201d WELS does not teach a \u201cbaptism in the Holy Spirit\u201d separate from and subsequent to water baptism. We do not see speaking in tongues and faith healing as normative for Christians today.\nFor more detail to your question, you might benefit from A Lutheran Looks at the Assemblies of God.

{"prompt": "Parental responsibility of Baptism", "completion": "Would it be proper for a concerned friend or relative to privately baptize a child whose parents, though raised in the Lutheran faith, have been negligent in doing so?\n\n\nOur normal practice is not to baptize children without the consent of their parents, unless the child\u2019s death is imminent. That practice recognizes that parents have primary responsibility for the spiritual care and upbringing of their children (Ephesians 6:4).\nI would encourage a conversation with the parents. If they were raised \u201cin the Lutheran faith\u201d and presumably baptized as infants themselves, ask them how their thinking and beliefs have changed since then. Their answers and responses will tell you how to proceed. I also wonder if it is possible for one of our pastors to visit them and speak with them about Baptism.\nYour question about Baptism underscores the importance of that sacrament, and yet we need to keep it in perspective. While the Holy Spirit can plant saving faith in hearts through Baptism, that faith needs to be nurtured through regular use of God\u2019s word. That calls for even more parental involvement in the lives of their children.\nDo what you can to encourage these parents to carry out their parental responsibilities in having their child baptized. It goes without saying that this includes praying for them. God bless your efforts."}
{"prompt": "Women's roles and gambling", "completion": "What is the WELS stance on women's role in society, i.e., should women supervise men in the workplace and what is the stance on gambling, i.e., lottery tickets?\n\n\nYour first question requires a much longer response than is appropriate for this forum, so let me steer you to a couple of resources that can offer a thorough response and detailed explanation. This link will take you to a free resource titled \u201cThe God-Given Roles of Man and Woman in the Christian\u2019s Everyday Life.\u201d\nIn addition, I can recommend a couple of resources from Northwestern Publishing House: Man and Woman in God\u2019s World and A Bible Study on Man and Woman in God\u2019s World.\nThere was a very recent question and answer on the subject of gambling. This link will review that information for you."}
{"prompt": "Concern for children and future spouses", "completion": "My children were brought up WELS. They have met the one they would like to marry, but that one is of another faith. My children are considering a non-denominational church, so as to not choose their Lutheran faith, or faith of the one they want to marry. Of course I am not happy with that. We brought our kids up going to church every Sunday, Sunday school, daily devotions. It scares me that they now can consider anything other than our WELS Lutheran faith. What is something loving and caring that I can say to them, to make them think harder about it, and hopefully make the right decision? I have said to them all I can think of. I pray about this daily. I don't want to give up hope.\n\n\nSince I do not know what you have talked about with your children, please excuse any suggestions that you have already pursued.\nI can suggest that your children invite their significant other to events that can expose them more to what our churches teach: worship services and Bible classes. They pass along reading material like Forward in Christ and Meditations. They can read articles on the synod\u2019s website. They can speak with your pastor. They can consider attending a no-strings-attached Bible Information Class.\nYou can lovingly explain to your children that membership in a visible church is a tangible way of doing what Jesus said: \u201cacknowledging him before others\u201d (Matthew 10:32). You can explain to your children that when people join a church, their membership is an indication that they believe what the church teaches. It is inconsistent and misleading when people join a church and reject the doctrines of that church. You can ask your children, lovingly, if they could in good conscience join a church which teaches doctrines they do not believe. Could they in good conscience join a church that denies the sacraments, for example? Jesus\u2019 statement of loving him more than parents or children (Matthew 10:37) applies also to our spouses.\nYour children are having the kinds of conversations that need to take place before marriage. I would especially encourage the participation of your pastor in those conversations.\nContinue to pray for your children, and tell them you are doing that. God bless you and your family."}
{"prompt": "Goliath's height", "completion": "I stumbled across a discussion online where someone claimed that the Septuagint and Dead Sea Scrolls contain a much shorter version of the story of David and Goliath, where Goliath is about three feet shorter and many details are omitted.  Is this true, and if so, why?\n\n\nWhere the details differ is in the height of the giant. The Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Hebrew Old Testament) lists Goliath\u2019s height as four and one-half cubits instead of six and one-half cubits. So you have a difference between a translation and a canonical writing.\nHeight details aside, the biblical account is all about the Lord giving David, who on his own was no match for Goliath, victory over Israel\u2019s enemy."}
{"prompt": "Hobbies for Christians", "completion": "Is skiing an acceptable hobby for a Christian? I heard someone say it is too dangerous for a Christian.\n\n\nUnless we are talking about skiing blindfolded or taking other risks that might tempt God (Matthew 4:5-7), snow skiing or water skiing can be acceptable and enjoyable hobbies for a child of God. Certainly, for the novice, either sport can present dangers."}
{"prompt": "Keeping Q & A site in perspective", "completion": "Do FAQs on the wels.net site reflect the official teachings of the Wisconsin Synod?  They are sometimes used by our detractors on social media sites, but should they be cited in defense as \"official teachings\"?  On such issues as (salvation and suicide), isn't there diversity of opinion and teaching within the WELS pastorate?\n\n\nBelow the area where people submit questions on this website, there is this information: \u201cThe answers provided through this Q&A service are not to be construed as the official opinions, statements, or representations of WELS. Answers provided through this Q&A service are provided for informational purposes only and are not intended to replace consultation with your parent, pastor, Christian counselor, financial advisor, or other similar person.\u201d\nYou will not find diversity of opinion among our pastors regarding salvation. There is unanimity regarding this passage that speaks of Jesus: \u201cSalvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved\u201d (Acts 4:12). Might there be differences of opinion on whether or not to officiate at the funeral of a person who committed suicide, because of the circumstances and nature of the death? Yes, but there we are dealing with judgment calls regarding human behavior and not clear-cut biblical doctrines like salvation."}
{"prompt": "Revelation 2:17", "completion": "What does the white stone in Revelation 2:17 mean?\n\n\nIt is a picturesque way of speaking of \u201cjustification.\u201d To justify means \u201cto declare \u2018not guilty.\u2019\u201d Jurors in biblical days voted by putting a black stone (for guilty) or a white stone (for innocent/not guilty) in a receptacle. Revelation 2:17 puts in memorable style what the Bible says elsewhere, that God, the righteous Judge, has declared us not guilty of sin for Jesus\u2019 sake (Romans 4:25)."}
{"prompt": "Jesus' descent into hell", "completion": "The Apostles' Creed states that Jesus descended into hell.  I cannot find this in Scripture.  When did this happen and why?   I know others who have also questioned  this.\n\n\nThe scriptural basis for Jesus\u2019 descent into hell is 1 Peter 3:18-20: \u201cFor Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive in the Spirit. After being made alive, he went and made proclamation to the imprisoned spirits\u2014 to those who were disobedient long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built.\u201d Many also see Colossians 2:15 as alluding to Jesus\u2019 descent into hell: \u201cAnd having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.\u201d\nAfter Jesus\u2019 body and soul were reunited in the grave and before he appeared to people on earth, the Lord descended into hell. By his descent into hell, Jesus declared his victory over Satan and the forces of evil."}
{"prompt": "1 John 5:7", "completion": "Is it true that 1 John 5:7 is not in any Greek manuscript before the 1600s? If it is true, why is it in the King James Bible?\n\n\nA previous response to a similar question passed along this information: \u201cWhen Erasmus was publishing a NT text at the time of Luther, he did not have those verses [1 John 5:7-8] in any of the Greek manuscripts that were extant at the time. He said he would insert them only if a Greek text were found that included them. Apparently, a scribe forged a Greek document with those verses in the text, and Erasmus, not knowing that the document was forged, kept his promise to include them. But the evidence for 1 John 5:7-8 does not warrant their inclusion.\u201d This concerns the third edition of Erasmus\u2019 Greek New Testament in 1522.\nSince Martin Luther and the translators of the King James Version both used the Greek New Testament published by Erasmus, the verses in question made their way into their translations."}
{"prompt": "Friends living together", "completion": "Is it a sin to live with someone of the opposite sex if you are just friends?\n\n\nSin is involved with the situation you describe. Rather than distancing themselves from temptations to engage in premarital sexual activity (1 Corinthians 6:18), people living together before marriage are putting those temptations in front of themselves every day. If people think they would be able to withstand those temptations, Scripture offers a warning (1 Corinthians 10:12).\nIf a man and a woman living together without being married say they are refraining from sexual activity, they are still in a position of causing offense to others (Matthew 18:6-7) and emboldening them to sin. Love for God certainly drives our desire to live godly lives. Love for others is another strong motivator.\nEven if friends of the opposite sex did refrain from sexual activity in a live-in situation, they would need to ask themselves if their lives were in line with the admonition that \u201camong you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality\u201d (Ephesians 5:3). Two people of the opposite sex living together create more than a hint.\nLiving together before marriage may be all too common in our society today, but it does not honor marriage as God commands (Hebrews 13:4)."}
{"prompt": "Pastors and calls", "completion": "How do the names of our WELS pastors get on the call list? Some pastors' names seem to appear quite often on the Call Reports. Do pastors sometimes ask their name to be put on the call list? Thank you for your reply.\n\n\nDistrict presidents, who are responsible for assembling call lists for pastors, will consult with one another. On occasion, members of a congregation experiencing a vacancy might suggest the name of a pastor to be considered for inclusion on their call list. In such cases, district presidents will take those suggestions under advisement.\nThere can be circumstances\u2014on the rarer side\u2014that lead a pastor to contact his district president and request consideration for inclusion on a call list to serve elsewhere. Those circumstances have the best interests of the pastor and the public ministry in mind.\nFrom a human perspective, pastors might receive calls frequently for a number of related reasons. They might be known for their God-given gifts and their faithfulness in using them. They might be blessed with a good reputation in the church. They might offer more visible service to the church at-large, so that others\u2014beyond the members of the congregation they serve\u2014are familiar with them and their ministries. Numerous other factors can enter into the equation as well.\nI can assure you that receiving a call to serve elsewhere can be an unsettling time in life. Then again, receiving a call to serve elsewhere provides a good opportunity for a pastor to evaluate his gifts and ministry, and prayerfully determine where those gifts can best be used at that time in life. We all would do well to remember our pastors in prayer\u2014especially when they are holding multiple calls."}
{"prompt": "Revelation 13 and Matthew 24", "completion": "My brother told me that in Revelation 13 it says there will be a one government or ruler, and peace on earth. How can this be if Jesus said in Matthew 24 there will be rumors of war, nation against nation and kingdom against kingdom? \n\n\nRevelation 13 describes Satan\u2019s allies in church and state. It does not speak of peace on earth. Far from it, the chapter describes Satan\u2019s allies troubling God\u2019s people.\n\u201cWars and rumors of war\u201d (Matthew 24:6) are some of the signs that point to the end times.\nWhen the last day comes, then God\u2019s people will enjoy perfect peace forever (Revelation 21:1-4)."}
{"prompt": "Congregations and convention delegates", "completion": "Are WELS congregations asked to send delegates to district conventions?\n\n\nYes, they are. Congregations will send delegates to district conventions, that meet in even-numbered years.

{"prompt": "Biblical teachings on several subjects", "completion": "How does your denomination view same-sex marriage, LGBTQ, and women pastors?\n\n\nThe best and fairest approach I can take for you is to refer you to information that provides good context for our scriptural views on these subjects.\nThis first link will take you to a document that explains what the Bible teaches about marriage: \u201cThe Bible and Lutherans teach that marriage is the union of one man and one woman. It is a partnership in which the man is the loving head. Marriage is established by God. It is a holy relationship not to be broken. A married person sins if he or she divorces without a biblical reason. Before God, no divorce is valid except in cases of fornication or desertion. The tendency to consider marriage as unimportant results in great harm to the family, the church, and the nation. Genesis 2:18; Ephesians 5:24,25; Hebrews 13:4; Matthew 19:9; 1 Corinthians 7:15; Psalm 51:10\u201d\nThis second link will take you to a \u201cStatement on Homosexuality.\u201d\nA third link will take you to \u201cThis We Believe: A Statement of Belief of the WELS.\u201d In the \u201cChurch and Ministry\u201d section you will find this wording: \u201cWe believe that women may participate in offices and activities of the public ministry except where that work involves authority over men (1 Timothy 2:11,12). This means that women may not serve as pastors nor participate in assemblies of the church in ways that exercise authority over men (1 Corinthians 11:3; 14:33-35).\u201d\nMore than anything else, know what we believe about salvation through Jesus Christ.\u00a0 This final link will provide context for this statement:\u00a0 \u201cWe believe that sinners are saved by grace alone. Grace is the undeserved love of God for sinners. This love led God to give sinners everything they need for their salvation. It is all a gift of God. People do nothing to earn any of it (Ephesians 2:8,9).\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Degrees of punishment", "completion": "Does Scripture give any indication of degrees of punishment in hell?\n\n\nThe following Bible references are often associated with \u201cdegrees of torment\u201d or punishment in hell: Matthew 10:15, 11:22, Luke 12:47-48; and, Romans 2:11-12."}
{"prompt": "Baptism and instruction in the Word", "completion": "Is baptism a guarantee of eternal life in heaven? Where in Scripture would it say this?  I know of a situation where an infant was baptized because a relative insisted on it, yet the parents have no intention of bringing the child up in the 'nurture and admonition of the Lord.'  If a baptized person doesn't believe the gospel, then how can eternal life be sure?\n\n\nI mislead myself if I think that I have fulfilled all my Christian parental responsibilities by having my children baptized. Having my children baptized was the easy part. (Actually, as their pastor, I baptized them.) Following up on that Baptism through Christian education was much more demanding, but it was all worth it.\nBaptism is certainly not a meaningless act. Jesus\u2019 words in Mark 16:16 emphasize that. Baptism saves (Titus 3:5-6) because through the Christian faith it creates, people enjoy the salvation Jesus won for them. Baptism clothes people in Jesus\u2019 righteousness (Galatians 3:26-27).\nYet, if the faith created in Baptism is not nurtured and preserved through the use of the gospel in Word and Sacrament (the Lord\u2019s Supper), faith can grow weaker and ultimately die. In such cases, people then forfeit the blessings that Baptism had brought them.\nBaptism is not an absolute guarantee of eternal life in that it is like some sort of lucky charm. As children grow, Baptism needs the \u201cfollow through\u201d of teaching God\u2019s word (Matthew 28:19-20)."}
{"prompt": "Changing congregational demographics", "completion": "I understand the role relationship with men and women in a WELS church, and specifically that women cannot be on a church council or vote at a voter\u2019s meeting.  My question is what happens when a small rural congregation no longer has enough adult male members to fill the Council positions, or in the extreme, no adult male members at all? Would such a church be required to close and its members instructed to join another church, or would women be able to vote and hold offices even though the pastor is male? Thank you.\n\n\nIf the demographics of your congregation approach the situation you are describing, your congregation would need to be in contact with your district president to explore appropriate courses of actions.\nRegarding the constitutions and bylaws of congregations, each district has a constitution committee that reviews and approves proposed changes."}
{"prompt": "Pronouncing Amen", "completion": "Is there a grammatical, traditional, or other reason for when to pronounce the word 'Amen' either  'Ah-men' or   'Ay-men'?\n\n\nThe pronunciation of the Hebrew and Greek words is \u201cah-Main.\u201d When we transliterate those words into English, we encounter differences of opinion and traditions. A common practice is to speak \u201cAy-men\u201d and sing \u201cAh-men\u201d (using your examples). There is no right or wrong when it comes to this."}

You might also be able to borrow a book from your pastor or your church\u2019s library.\nThe book summarizes its contents this way: \u201cAs a young man, Daniel was among the first Jews who were deported to Babylon.

{"prompt": "Contact with friends outside marriage", "completion": "Hi, pastor.  From a Christian point of view, is it OK for a person (man or woman) to have a friendly relationship (like texting or calling over the phone) with your former boyfriend/girlfriend after getting married? I personally feel like it would lead to sinning and never should have such a relationship behind the spouse's back which would lead to unnecessary suspicions.  Kindly guide, and appreciate your response. Thank You!\n\n\nI remember once reading a person\u2019s humorous explanation as to why the bride and groom extinguish the two separate candles after lighting the unity candle during their wedding ceremony: \u201cThat is to signify that there are no old flames.\u201d\nWhen \u201ctwo become one\u201d in marriage (Matthew 19:5-6), they pledge their faithfulness to one another. I would have to ask what kind of faithfulness it is to maintain the level of contact with a former girlfriend or boyfriend that you describe in your questions. Such contact would present temptations for unfaithfulness and hurt the other spouse.\nOn a related matter, it is not a surprise to learn from studies that, when the kind of contact you describe occurs on social media, marriages suffer greatly.\nWhen husbands and wives put each other first (Ephesians 5:21-33), a person could say to them, \u201cHand your cell phone over to your spouse,\u201d and there would be no inappropriate communications on the device. Love for God and love for one\u2019s spouse call for that kind of openness and honesty and faithfulness.\nI hope this response addresses your concerns."}
{"prompt": "One Christian's witness", "completion": "Every day I see more written about a godless society. I became a Christian, a child of God, a little over a year ago and I am still learning about what our Lord Jesus Christ and what He wants me to do to become stronger in my faith. My question is, how can I as one person help to bring more people to Jesus Christ? This world we live in can sometimes make it difficult to get people to understand why coming to Jesus Christ can make their lives so much better. \n\n\nHow wonderful to hear what God worked in your heart and life a year ago! God bless your faithful use of his word and sacrament, that you grow and mature in the faith.\nHow can you\u2014one person\u2014help to bring more people to Jesus Christ? Here are some thoughts that come to mind.\n\u201cLet your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven\u201d (Matthew 5:16). Live your Christian faith in every area of your life. Let people see the joy, the hope, the confidence you have as a child of God. Live your faith, and then see if people inquire about your faith.\n\u201cAlways be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect\u2026\u201d (1 Peter 3:15). When you live your Christian faith and people ask about it, be ready to tell them who Jesus is and what he means to you. You don\u2019t need to have all the answers; just letting people know about your Savior can spark their interest in him.\n\u201cPray\u2026that the message of the Lord may spread rapidly and be honored\u2026 (2 Thessalonians 3:1). Recognize that neither you nor I can change anyone\u2019s heart. But God can, and God does through his powerful word. So, pray that God blesses those people to whom you witness. Pray that God changes their hearts, that they look to Jesus alone for life and salvation.\n\u201cWe ought therefore to show hospitality to such people so that we may work together for the truth\u201d (3 John 8). You are one person, yes, but when you pool your resources with others of the same faith and fellowship, much more kingdom work can be done. Your offerings and mine can support people to take God\u2019s word to places that we cannot go in person. So, we give back to God, joyfully and generously, some of the gifts he has given us.\nThe Christian life will be less stressful if we keep our role in mind. We are planters and sowers of God\u2019s word; only God can bring about positive results from the planting and sowing of his word (1 Corinthians 3:6-7). So, let\u2019s do what we can\u2014individually and collectively\u2014and then trust God when he promises, \u201cAs the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return to it without watering the earth and making it bud and flourish, so that it yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater, so is my word that goes out from my mouth: It will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it\u201d (Isaiah 55:10-11).\nGod\u2019s blessings to you!"}
{"prompt": "The Bible and faith", "completion": "I am having a small debate/discussion with non-WELS friends and I would like to convey the belief I have that we believe that Christ died for our sins.  The definition of believe is 'to accept something as true...' according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary.  The friends are saying that it is a two-step process to 'accept' Christ... first to 'know' that Jesus died for your sins and then to 'accept' him as your Savior.  I grew up in the WELS Lutheran church from birth and was baptized and confirmed in the same church.  I recall this discussion over the years, but would like to know if there are any Bible verses that I could mention to them in addition to saying what I have here about the definition of believe.  Thank you for your time.   \n\n\nSaving faith consists of knowledge (John 17:3), assent that the knowledge is true (1 Thessalonians 2:13) and, above all, trust in Jesus Christ as Savior (Psalm 31:14; John 20:28; 2 Timothy 1:12).\nThe Bible makes it clear that saving faith is not a human decision (Romans 8:7; 1 Corinthians 2:14; 12:3; Ephesians 2:8. That last verse states clearly that saving faith is a \u201cgift\u201d from God. What Jesus said of his first disciples is true of all his followers: \u201cYou did not choose me, but I chose you\u2026\u201d (John 15:16).\nThe only reason you and I can accept as true what the Bible teaches is because of the Holy Spirit\u2019s working in our hearts through that same word of God.\nI hope this helps. God bless your conversations with your friends."}
{"prompt": "Relevancy of Baptism", "completion": "I was baptized and confirmed in the WELS. A few years after my confirmation I began to walk away from the faith until I no longer considered myself a Christian.  The Holy Spirit has worked faith in my heart again. Is my baptism still relevant even though I walked away for years? Thank you. \n\n\nThrough Baptism God gave you great blessings (Acts 2:38; Romans 6:3; Galatians 3:27; Titus 3:5-7). If you \u201cwalked away from the faith,\u201d you forfeited those blessings. Now, through the Holy Spirit\u2019s work in your heart, those blessings of Baptism are yours again. Yes, your Baptism is certainly still relevant. Praise God for that!\nThink of Jesus\u2019 parable of the lost son (Luke 15:11-32). When the wayward son returned home, he enjoyed all the blessings of his loving and forgiving father. In a much greater way, God our Father welcomes back those who strayed. His children enjoy again the blessings that they had previously forfeited.\nStay close to your Lord through faithful use of word and sacrament. God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Satan and hell", "completion": "When did hell come into being? Was it before the fall of \"the evil angel\" (devil)? God surely knew that the angel would fall and had a place where he (and others) would spend all eternity. \n\n\nWithout putting a timeline on the origin of hell, the Bible simply tells us that at the end of God\u2019s creating work, he pronounced everything he had made as \u201cvery good\u201d (Genesis 1:31). At some point after that, and prior to the temptation in the Garden of Eden, Satan and other angels rebelled against God and were cast into hell (2 Peter 2:4). Jesus explained that hell was \u201cprepared for the devil and his angels\u201d (Matthew 25:41)."}
{"prompt": "Sins and trespasses", "completion": "Recently my church, a WELS church, changed the words to our Lord's Prayer. The word trespasses was changed to sin.  I believe that only God or a called servant may forgive sin. Why was this change made?  This issue is very disturbing to the older members of the congregation to the point that some are considering leaving our church. \n\n\nOn the two occasions when the Bible records the Lord speaking the prayer that is named after him, Jesus used different words for violating God\u2019s holy will. That is not surprising, as the Bible does as well. It speaks of \u201csin,\u201d \u201cdebt,\u201d \u201ctransgression,\u201d \u201ctrespass,\u201d among other terms for disobeying God.\nIn the Lord\u2019s Prayer we find in Matthew\u2019s gospel, Jesus used the word \u201cdebt\u201d \u2013 \u201cForgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.\u201d In the Lord\u2019s Prayer we find in Luke\u2019s gospel, Jesus used the words \u201csin\u201d and \u201cdebt\u201d \u2013 \u201cForgive our sins as we forgive everyone indebted to us.\u201d There is a Greek word for \u201ctrespass,\u201d but that word does not occur in Matthew or Luke\u2019s account.\nSo, how did we come to speak \u201cForgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us\u201d? We can thank the Anglican Church for that. For hundreds of years already, the version of the Lord\u2019s Prayer in the Book of Common Prayer has focused attention on forgiving \u201ctrespasses.\u201d When the time came for German Lutherans in our country to begin utilizing English liturgical materials, they adopted the version of the Lord\u2019s Prayer from the Book of Common Prayer. Tradition has led many Lutherans in the United States to continue using that version.\nIf your congregation recently began using the \u201ccontemporary Lord\u2019s Prayer,\u201d substituting \u201csins\u201d for \u201ctrespasses,\u201d it is not doing anything wrong. \u201cSin\u201d is a more accurate translation of the original Greek than \u201ctrespass.\u201d And, whether we use \u201csin\u201d or \u201ctrespass,\u201d we are acknowledging in the Lord\u2019s Prayer that we have acted contrary to God\u2019s holy will and seek his forgiveness.\nIn addition, we also speak of forgiving those who sin against us. Speaking the news of forgiveness is not limited to pastors. Keep in mind that in the Lord\u2019s Prayer you and I speak of \u201cforgiving those who sin against us.\u201d That is what God, elsewhere in the Bible, tells us to do. \u201cBe kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you\u201d (Ephesians 4:32). \u201cBear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you\u201d (Colossians 3:13).\nI would encourage you\u2014and others in your congregation who share your view\u2014to speak to your pastor and allow him to show you how the words of the Lord\u2019s Prayer in the original Greek can be translated into English."}
{"prompt": "Wedding attendant", "completion": "Can a non-member, non-believer stand as maid of honor and/or bridesmaid/groomsman in a WELS wedding?\n\n\nYes. There are no biblical fellowship principles involved with the scenario you present. The individual is not leading or conducting any part of the worship service.\nIdeally, the individual will benefit from hearing the word of God and its focus on Jesus Christ as Savior."}
{"prompt": "Witnessing and conversion", "completion": "Hi, I\u2019m a Lutheran who wants other people who aren\u2019t Christians to receive salvation and go to heaven.  But I understand that we believe it is faith alone and that it\u2019s not our choice to \u201caccept\u201d Christ as Savior; it\u2019s the work of God alone.  If we believe that it\u2019s God\u2019s work alone, doesn\u2019t that mean that we shouldn\u2019t even bother preaching to non-believers?  And also, if I were to preach to them, what do I say about receiving salvation?  Many evangelicals would tell people to accept and trust him, but since we don\u2019t \u201caccept\u201d Christ, do I tell them to put their faith in Jesus and they will be saved?  I\u2019m sorry if this is a long question, but I don\u2019t know who to ask and it\u2019s hard to put into words.\n\n\nConversion certainly is God\u2019s work (1 Corinthians 12:3; Ephesians 2:8), but Romans 10:14-15 explains that God works through his word to bring people to faith. So, there is a need to share the word of God with people.\nAs you witness to other people about Jesus, you can encourage them to look to the Lord as their Savior. If it happens that they do, it is because of the Holy Spirit\u2019s working in their hearts through the word of God and not because of any decision on their part.\nWhen the apostle Paul answered the jailer of Philippi\u2019s question about salvation, he said, \u201cBelieve in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved\u2014you and your household\u201d (Acts 16:31). Paul was not looking for the jailer to make a decision and invite the Lord into his heart. The Bible explains why we can\u2019t do that and don\u2019t want to do that by nature. Theologians have called a statement like Paul\u2019s a \u201cgospel imperative.\u201d Statements like that direct people to action, but the words themselves contain the power to carry out the instruction. God alone is responsible for Christian faith.\nKeep witnessing to your friends. God bless your witnessing of Jesus!"}
{"prompt": "Triduum schedule", "completion": "What times on what days should be considered the beginning and end of the Paschal Triduum?  I've heard versions including Thursday evening through Saturday night, Friday afternoon through Sunday morning, and Thursday evening through Sunday evening.  I recently taught a class on our church year and there was confusion on this topic among members, including some lifelong WELS members.  Thanks in advance for clarifying this for us.  \n\n\nWith human customs, it is not surprising to find variations. I can pass along to you this introductory information about the Triduum from the WELS Resource Center.\n\u201cFor more information about the history of the Triduum, see page 183 and following in Christian Worship: Occasional Services. However, a simple explanation would be this. The Triduum adds one service to Holy Week from what most WELS churches are used to. Specifically, it adds the Great Vigil, one of the most ancient services in the Christian Church. And it organized the services of the \u2018three days\u2019 (i.e. triduum) so that they go together. There is no benediction after Maundy Thursday or Good Friday, because they are just parts 1 and 2 of a three part observance.\n\u201cSome churches have arranged the three services into one large worship folder. For ease of printing and customization, we have kept them distinct. This allows churches to modify the services using sound pastoral judgment to be appropriate for each congregation\u2019s sensibility. In some locations, it might cause confusion to not have a benediction and to ask people to leave the church in silence. That portion of the worship folder can be easily modified.\n\u201cThe Great Vigil is growing in popularity throughout the WELS. There are churches that have used it for years now and find it as well attended as Maundy Thursday or Good Friday. Traditionally, it is held late on Saturday night. However, one possibility to introduce it to your church would be to do it as your Easter sunrise service. It has a very different tone than a festival Easter service. Members would be encouraged to come to it and a festival service on Sunday morning. You could have an Easter breakfast in between.\u201d\nThese links will take you to the preceding information and will also provide you with worship service templates for the Triduum."}
{"prompt": "Roman Catholic Church teaching on justification", "completion": "I once heard a Catholic say about salvation that \u201che has been saved, is being saved, and will be saved.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what to think about this. Is this an accurate thing to say? I guess in other words the Catholic is saying that salvation is a process. So what is it? Is salvation a process or a one-time event?\n\n\nThe person who spoke to you was expressing the official teaching of the Roman Catholic Church. The Catechism of the Catholic Church quotes the Council of Trent: \u201cJustification is not only the remission of sins, but also the sanctification and renewal of the interior man.\u201d That mixture of justification and sanctification is not what the Bible teaches.\nThis link will take you to the section of This We Believe that conveys our confession of what the Bible teaches regarding justification.\nYou may also be interested in A Lutheran Looks at Catholics.

{"prompt": "Responsibilities of church and government", "completion": "Seeking a Christian perspective on illegal immigration, I started with Ephesians 2:19, from there progressed to Leviticus 24:22. I also added Romans 13.  I feel I understand the compassion and love we are to extend.  How is Christian love for the alien among us square with authority of government?  I see this as accepting the alien as a member of the Kingdom but not of the country. I see the church as the giver of compassion and love, doing all we can for the spiritual and earthly needs for aliens among us, yet understanding they are in our country illegally and are subject to the authority of the government (punishment).  Is my understanding correct, or where am I in error?  \n\n\nWhile the first two passages you listed do speak of aliens, they are not applicable to current events in our country. Ephesians 2:19 describes the status that Gentile believers enjoy in God\u2019s sight: they are members of God\u2019s family. Leviticus 24:22 is part of the civil law code that governed the Old Testament people of Israel.\nRomans 13 has application to our current events because the timeless truth is that governmental authorities rule as representatives of God. The laws they establish may be popular or unpopular, but we need to obey them unless they conflict with God\u2019s word (Acts 5:29). In our country, there are avenues for proposing changes to existing legislation.\nScripture certainly instructs us to love all people. \u201cTherefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers\u201d (Galatians 6:10). The good we want to do to all people is that which addresses their physical needs and especially their spiritual needs. We do good to people while obeying the laws established by governmental authorities.\nYou are correct in understanding that the church\u2019s primary responsibility is for people\u2019s spiritual welfare, while the government\u2019s responsibility is our physical welfare and well-being."}

{"prompt": "\"The Orchard\" devotion", "completion": "I read a daily devotion on April 3, 2018 titled \"The Orchard.\" It really was inspiring to me and I am unable to find it to re-read it. Is there any way to get it? Thanks.\n\n\nBelow is the devotion you were seeking. God bless your devotional life!\nChrist has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. 1 Corinthians 15:20.\nIt\u2019s difficult to put into words how it feels for the owners of an apple orchard when a bumper crop of apples is just beginning to ripen. You could ask the owners, of course. But even they would find it difficult to come up with what to say. What they feel in their veins is a strange brew of adrenalin, purpose, anticipation, and joy. And that indescribable sensation begins every time they spot those first few ripened apples on those first few trees. The core of such a thrill is in knowing that this beautiful, ripened fruit is only the first of many and many more to come.\nKeep that in mind the next time you are in a funeral procession. Keep that in mind the next time you find yourself accompanying the remains of a Christian to the cemetery.\nAs you stand at the gravesite, look at the casket or the urn. Then look at the row upon row of tombstones around you. Think of all the Christians whose bodies quietly rest beneath the green lawn on which you stand. Even though, in that moment, you are looking at that place through the eyes of grief, remember how your God sees it. For those who die in the Lord, a cemetery is not a final resting place. Not at all.\nRather, a cemetery for the Christian is more like an orchard. And not only is it like an orchard, it is like an orchard poised and pulsating with anticipation and joy. For the reality is that our Brother, Jesus Christ, has already risen from the grave, his body glorious and perfect.\nBecause he has already conquered sin and death through his own death on the cross, we know that his resurrection is only the first of many and many more to come.\nAnd so, do we grieve when death comes? Of course. But never forget that underneath even our grief there is that wonderful pulse of anticipation and joy.\nIt is there because Jesus lives!\nPrayer: Lord Jesus, the next time the death of a dear Christian brings me grief, remind me that underneath even my grief there lies the vibrant joy of what soon will come. Amen."}

{"prompt": "Sin and consequences", "completion": "Does God punish us when we do something wrong? \n\n\nThe prophet Isaiah wrote about the Messiah, Jesus Christ: \u201cSurely he took up our pain and bore our suffering, yet we considered him punished by God, stricken by him, and afflicted. But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to our own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all\u201d (Isaiah 53: 4-6). Jesus endured the punishment of the world\u2019s sins as the innocent Lamb of God.\nRomans 8:1-2 states: \u201cTherefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death.\u201d When the Holy Spirit creates saving faith in Jesus in our hearts, we enjoy the benefit of the Lamb of God\u2019s work: we have peace with God through the forgiveness of sins.\nWhen Christians sin, God does not punish them. He has already punished Jesus in their place. What God may do is exercise discipline Christians (cf. Hebrews 12:4-12). Discipline is far different from punishment. The motive behind discipline is love and it has the good of people in mind. So, no, God does not punish Christians when they do wrong.\nThe \u201cLight for our path\u201d column in the September 2018 issue of Forward in Christ will address a question that is similar to yours."}
{"prompt": "Psalms and vengeance", "completion": "My question has to do with how I would reconcile complete and unconditional forgiveness of others with some of the psalms that may appear to represent the opposite. An example would be Psalm 109 and others like it, in which revenge against enemies is wanted with very specific examples given. If I pray along with a psalm like this and feel the same way I can imagine David did in the psalm towards people who harmed him, how can I reconcile wanting and asking for revenge, while simultaneously forgiving the same individuals?\n\n\nWhen reading the \u201cimprecatory psalms\u201d like Psalm 109, it is important to keep in mind that the inspired writers were not expressing personal vengeance for their enemies. They were asking God to deal with his enemies according to his promise: \u201cIt is mine to avenge; I will repay\u201d (Deuteronomy 32:35).\nGod is loving and God is just. As a loving God, he desires the salvation of all people (John 3:16; 1 Timothy 2:4; 2 Peter 3:9). As a just God, he will condemn those who reject him (Mark 16:16).\nIn our prayer life as Christians, we reflect God\u2019s attributes of love and justice. We pray for the salvation of others, and we pray that God \u201cbreaks and defeats every evil plan and purpose of the devil, the world, and our sinful flesh, which try to prevent us from keeping God\u2019s name holy and letting his kingdom\u201d (Luther\u2019s Small Catechism, the Third Petition of the Lord\u2019s Prayer).\nKeeping that explanation in mind, our praying of the Lord\u2019s Prayer is not unlike the content of the imprecatory psalms: while we pray for God to keep us in the saving faith and bring others to saving faith, we pray that God defeats everyone and everything ultimately opposed to his kingdom.\nLike the inspired psalm writers, personal vengeance is not part of our prayers. We ask God to deal with his enemies according to his promise: \u201cDo not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God\u2019s wrath, for it is written: \u2018It is mine to avenge; I will repay,\u2019 says the Lord\u201d (Romans 12:19)."}

{"prompt": "Compassion and laws", "completion": "With all the media attention on the government's policy of separating illegal immigrant children from their parents, I am hearing a lot of non-Christians quoting the Bible, particularly passages about kindness and compassion. I feel these passages are often quoted out of context. These discussions are coming up because the attorney general said the Bible supports the government's policy of separating families. I also feel that was taken out of context. What is the appropriate response, in terms of the Bible, to both sides of this political debate? \r\n\n\n\nA recent question addressed the same subject matter. Let me pass along a summary of thoughts.\nScripture certainly instructs us to love all people. \u201cTherefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers\u201d (Galatians 6:10). We do good to people by addressing their physical needs and especially their spiritual needs. We do good to all people while obeying the laws established by governmental authorities.\nRomans 13 teaches that governmental authorities rule as representatives of God. As in the church and home, some people in governmental positions represent God faithfully, while others do not. The laws that governmental authorities pass may be popular or unpopular, but we need to obey them unless they conflict with God\u2019s word (Acts 5:29). If there are laws we do not like, we can let our thoughts be known and propose changes to our legislators.\nThe question you ask has us think of compassion on one side of us and the fourth commandment on the other side. \u201cTherefore, as God\u2019s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience\u201d (Colossians 3:12). \u201cShow proper respect to everyone, love the family of believers, fear God, honor the emperor\u201d (1 Peter 2:17). Christians will seek to love God and their neighbors, and obey God and his representatives."}

It could be that the pastor and the Board of Elders propose a schedule and then report to the Church Council and/or Voters Assembly for ratification or to pass along that information. Congregational members might be surveyed to indicate their preferences for a Holy Communion Schedule.\nRecognizing the variety of ways that congregations govern themselves, it is probably safe to say that a congregation\u2019s regular Holy Communion schedule often originates with thoughts from its pastor, but then he works through proper channels for the schedule to become the congregation\u2019s.\nIf you have questions about your congregation\u2019s Communion schedule, do speak to your pastor."}

Could you please reference some Bible verses so I can understand this better?\n\n\nIn the Apostles\u2019 Creed we confess about Jesus: \u201cHe descended into hell.\u201d\nThe scriptural basis for Jesus\u2019 descent into hell is 1 Peter 3:18-20: \u201cFor Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive in the Spirit. After being made alive, he went and made proclamation to the imprisoned spirits\u2014 to those who were disobedient long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built.\u201d Many also see Colossians 2:15 as alluding to Jesus\u2019 descent into hell: \u201cAnd having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.\u201d\nAfter Jesus\u2019 body and soul were reunited in the grave and before he appeared to people on earth, the Lord descended into hell.

{"prompt": "Holy water", "completion": "I have noticed that some Catholic families utilize a \"holy water font\" (i.e. a hanging vessel on the wall near the front door containing holy water to bless oneself with upon entering the home) in their homes.

The concept of it seems appealing to me but I also don't want to be taking part in anything that is not biblical. I'd like some direction on this; thank you!\n\n\nWater can certainly remind Christians of the waters of baptism, but the Roman Catholic Church\u2019s understanding and usage of \u201choly water\u201d goes far beyond that.\nThe Roman Catholic Church considers holy water to be a \u201csacramental.\u201d That church\u2019s Catechism defines sacramentals as \u201csacred signs which bear a resemblance to the sacraments. They signify effects, particularly of a spiritual nature, which are obtained through the intercession of the Church. By them men are disposed to receive the chief effect of the sacraments, and various occasions in life are rendered holy.\u201d Their Catechism goes on to say: \u201cSacramentals do not confer the grace of the Holy Spirit in the way that the sacraments do, but by the Church\u2019s prayer, they prepare us to receive grace and dispose us to cooperate with it.\u201d\nMartin Luther wrote that \u201cThe pope invented holy water, extreme unction, and many similar things to which he has ascribed forgiveness of sins.\u201d"}

{"prompt": "The high cost of salvation", "completion": "Why did Jesus have to suffer such an horrendous death to forgive us our sins if it was he who forgave us our sins to begin with, assuming he is God? Why didn\u2019t he just forgive us?\n\n\nJesus is God. Our Catechism teaches us that Jesus has divine names (Luke 2:11), he has divine attributes (John 1:2), he is responsible for divine works (cf. his many miracles) and he is to be given divine honor (John 5:22-23).\nGod explains in the Bible that he is a just and loving God. His justice demands that sin be punished (Ezekiel 18; Romans 6:23). His love moved him to provide a substitute to live and die in the place of sinners (Romans 5:19; 2 Corinthians 5:21).\nThe Bible teaches that the forgiveness of sins is God\u2019s free gift to people through faith in Jesus his Son. While forgiveness of sins is free to you and me, it came at a great cost to God. For that we praise God (2 Corinthians 5:15)."}
{"prompt": "Church sales", "completion": "Is there a WELS stance on garage or rummage sales?  As a young adult, while moving from LCMS to WELS, I was led to believe that church members are responsible for supporting the local congregation.  Still learning!\n\n\nThere is no synodical policy on the activities mentioned in your question. Differing local circumstances can lead to different practices. What I can do is pass along some observations from personal ministry experiences.\nWhat congregations will want to keep in mind is the impression given by such sales. Congregational fundraising can reinforce what many people wrongly think in the first place\u2014that \u201call the church is concerned about is money.\u201d Congregational fundraising can reinforce work-righteous thinking in the minds of the unchurched, leading them to conclude that \u201cI\u2019ve given to God, so I\u2019ve done my duty.\u201d Congregational fundraising can undermine a church\u2019s efforts to encourage its members to grow in their management of God\u2019s blessings by relying on community revenue.\nCongregations might utilize numerous community outreach efforts, including the sales you mentioned, to establish connections with their neighbors. As noted above, congregations will want to balance their exercise of Christian freedom with proper concern for all involved."}
{"prompt": "Longing for heaven", "completion": "Hello. I have been dealing with a terminal illness with no more help from doctors. I do believe that God has healing for me and I want His will to be done in my life. I guess my question is, and a part of me feels bad saying this, but is it a sin to want to die so I can go home to be with Him and Jesus? I am tired of the suffering and pain that it is causing me and my family. I am scared to die, but I know there is a better place for me in heaven, free from all this, and I get to be with Jesus. Thank you.\n\n\nDear friend, it is not a sin to want to be in heaven with Jesus. When the apostle Paul was first imprisoned in Rome, he wrote to the Christians in Philippi that he had mixed thoughts about continuing to live on earth or being with his Lord in heaven. \u201cFor to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain. If I am to go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know! I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far; but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body\u201d (Philippians 1:21-24). In 2 Corinthians 5:2 that same apostle spoke of his \u201clonging\u201d for heaven.\nWhile we look forward to our perfect life with God in eternity, we refrain from doing anything that would hasten the day of our death. We recognize that our times are in God\u2019s hands (Psalm 31:15).\nThe unknown experience of physical death can present us with fears and concerns. Thank God that he has taken away our reasons for fear. God has turned death into the means by which we enter his presence in heaven. Forgiveness of sins is God\u2019s gift to you through faith in Jesus Christ his Son (Ephesians 1:7). Eternal life is God\u2019s gift to you through faith in Jesus Christ his Son (John 11:25). As a baptized child of God, remember how God has clothed you with the garments of salvation Jesus won by his holy life and innocent death (Galatians 3:26-27). Continue to use God\u2019s gospel in word and sacrament for the forgiveness of sins and the strengthening of your faith.\nI trust you are in contact with your pastor. Do utilize the resources he has for you and your family. God bless you all with strength and peace and joy."}

{"prompt": "Suffering the torments of hell", "completion": "In \"Meditations\" on August 17, 2018, it said, \"Yes, Jesus suffered the torments of hell to pay for the sins of the whole world.\"  Is that a reference to the Apostles' Creed when it says, \"He descended into hell\"?  Could you give me the Bible passage that says that Jesus suffered in hell?  I always understood that Jesus \"descended into hell\" to proclaim victory.  Am I misinterpreting this sentence in \"Meditations\" or reading too much into it?\n\n\nYour understanding of Jesus\u2019 descent into hell is correct. Jesus went to hell to proclaim his victory over Satan and his allies. 1 Peter 3:18-20 describes that event. Many also see Colossians 2:15 as alluding to the Lord\u2019s descent into hell.\nBecause Jesus\u2019 descent into hell was one of triumph, there is no Bible passage that speaks of him suffering in hell.\nWhen I read that \u201cJesus suffered the torments of hell to pay for the sins of the whole world,\u201d I understand that this way\u2014that, on the cross, \u201cJesus suffered what amounts to hell.\u201d Hell is where people are abandoned by God and punished for sin. On the cross, Jesus suffered that abandonment and punishment when he cried out, \u201cMy God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\u201d (Matthew 27:46)\nYour question encourages us all to speak and write in the clearest manner possible, so that there is no misunderstanding of biblical truth."}
{"prompt": "The Bible and Lutheran Confessions", "completion": "It seems like WELS Lutherans put a lot of emphasis on Luther's Small Catechism but not on the rest of the works in the Book of Concord.  Why is this?\r\nIs it okay the read the King James Version of the Bible?  It is my favorite translation.  You say in the introduction to Luther's Catechism that it is a good translation of the Bible, though I heard someone say WELS members are not allowed to read it.\n\n\nNot knowing how you arrived at that conclusion, allow me to pass along some thoughts. As confessional Lutherans, we profess that God\u2019s word is the sole foundation of our faith (Ephesians 2:19-20). We state that the Lutheran Confessions, including Luther\u2019s Small Catechism, are true expositions of the word of God. We place appropriate emphasis on all the confessions of our faith.\nThere is nothing wrong with reading the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. Members of our church body are not prohibited from reading it. If you can understand the content of the KJV, keep reading it. If the language is a barrier to understanding what you are reading, you may find it helpful to use another translation."}
{"prompt": "Contrition and emotion", "completion": "How do I know I have proper contrition? Sometimes, after I sin, I don't feel very remorseful. I am afraid that the lack of emotional guilt within me following sin means I am not contrite. What role does emotion play in contrition?\n\n\nThrough the law and gospel, the Holy Spirit can certainly bring about different emotions within us. There can be sorrow over sin (2 Corinthians 7:8-11) and joy in the good news of salvation (Psalm 51:12).\nAnd yet, aren\u2019t there times in our lives when we lack sorrow over our sins and joy in our salvation? Certainly. Unfortunately, we can grow complacent to sin; we can take the message of salvation for granted. For those attitudes, we ask for God\u2019s forgiveness, and we know we have it through the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nWhere I am headed in my response to you is that we do not want to base our contrition and faith on our emotions\u2014or the level of our emotions. The certainty of our salvation is based on what Jesus Christ did by living as our perfect substitute and dying as our innocent substitute.\nYou and I recognize that in this life our confessions\u2014of sin and of faith\u2014will always be imperfect. Because of our weaknesses, we are able to identify with King David and his struggle with confessing sin (Psalm 32). Because of our weaknesses, we are able to identify with the man who said to Jesus, \u201cI do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!\u201d (Mark 9:24) Our confessions might be weak, but the one to whom they are directed is strong and powerful. God\u2019s message of forgiveness is consistent and reliable. I encourage you to focus on that rather than the emotional level of your contrition. God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Revelation of God", "completion": "Why is God considered a male?  Females carry the miracle of creating new life through their stem cells within the ovaries.  Men only pass on a package of DNA. In ancient times, it was believed that man produced life and injected into the womb/vessel of the woman.  Now we know better.  By what characteristics does God qualify as a male rather than a life-giving female?\n\n\nGod is spirit (John 4:24), having no physical body. (Jesus Christ, the second person of the Trinity, became man when he took on human flesh at his conception and birth.)\nThroughout Scripture God reveals himself as \u201che\u201d (Genesis 1:27, for example). The Bible calls the first two persons of the Trinity \u201cFather\u201d and \u201cSon.\u201d The Bible pictures God as the bridegroom and the church as the bride. When Jesus taught his disciples to pray, his prayer addressed God as \u201cOur Father.\u201d\nThe language of Scripture is consistent. The psalm writer summarizes all this well: \u201cKnow that the Lord is God. It is he who made us, and we are his; we are his people, the sheep of his pasture\u201d (Psalm 100:3)."}
{"prompt": "Close(d) communion", "completion": "Is it permissible for a WELS Lutheran to take Communion at an LCMS church?  Is it a sin?\n\n\nIt is well documented on this website that the two church bodies are not in doctrinal fellowship with one another. \u201cClose(d) communion\u201d is the stated practice of both church bodies.\nYou can benefit by examining the fellowship principles that Scripture teaches. This link will take you to one of our doctrinal statements on church fellowship that reviews appropriate Bible passages. It is always a serious matter to ignore what God says in his word.\nYou may be aware that representatives of WELS, the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod (LCMS) and the Evangelical Lutheran Synod (ELS) have had informal meetings in the past few years. You can read about the latest meeting here."}
{"prompt": "Worship attendance", "completion": "Is not attending church services once a week a sin of omission?  \n\n\nIt depends on what the reason for not attending worship services is. There are certainly legitimate and understandable reasons why people at times might not be able to worship the Lord in church: sickness, travel plans, unavoidable work schedule conflicts, etc.\nIt is a different situation entirely when people have the opportunity to worship the Lord in church but do not want to. In the explanation to the third commandment, our Catechism speaks of \u201cnot despising preaching and his [God\u2019s] word.\u201d If people are not attending worship services because they are despising God\u2019s word, that amounts to sin.\nAs Christians we want to recognize that our sinful nature wants nothing to do with God or his word. Our sinful nature rebels at any opportunity to worship with fellow Christians or read the Bible on our own. On the other hand, our new self agrees with the psalmist: \u201cI rejoiced with those who said to me, \u2018Let us go to the house of the Lord\u2019\u201d (Psalm 122:1).\nIn our daily walk of faith we strive to put down the sinful nature through repentance and to build up the new self through God\u2019s word. Worshiping the Lord in church, receiving the Lord\u2019s Supper, reading and studying God\u2019s Word individually and with others will build up our new self and strengthen our desire to worship the Lord in church."}
{"prompt": "Youth With A Mission", "completion": "How does WELS view the organization YWAM? My daughter went to one of their Discipleship Training Schools six years ago and never left. She is now in leadership. I am concerned with some of their teachings and more so the fact that they act as if they are their own denomination. There seems to be a high degree of control in the organization under the name of \"spiritual authority.\"  I am confused as to whether I should support my daughter's involvement in this group or not.\n\n\nOur church body has no official position on Youth With A Mission (YWAM). My own observations from their website tell me that the organization is ecumenical, describing itself as \u201cinterdenominational.\u201d It teaches that God speaks to people apart from his word. It endorses \u201cdecision theology.\u201d I did not find biblical teaching on the sacraments of Baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper.\nIn your relationship with your daughter, I would encourage you to ask her questions about her faith and compare her responses with Scripture. If there has been a shift in her beliefs, ask her about the reasons for the change. Patient listening can guide you in your conversations with her. Continue to pray that she clings to and confesses the truths of Scripture. God bless you and your family."}
{"prompt": "Re-baptism", "completion": "I was baptized and confirmed in WELS. I attended an ELCA university. After some post-college research into my family tree, I discovered the Jewish roots of my family. I desired to reconnect with my distant family heritage. After several years of study under both Conservative and Orthodox rabbis, I renounced the Christian faith and officially became Jewish.  \r\nRecently my attention has turned to studying who the \u201cJewish messiah\u201d is. I have been studying with Christians and \u201cMessianic Jews\u201d from various backgrounds for about two years now. I have read on your website that re-baptism isn\u2019t necessary for one who \u201cwandered away\u201d from the faith and returns, but what about someone who formally renounced their Christian faith publicly before a court of Rabbis? Is re-baptism necessary? Thank you for your time. \n\n\nRe-baptism is not necessary. In Baptism, God offers and gives the forgiveness of sins. He clothes people in the righteousness Jesus Christ won (Galatians 3:26-27). People enjoy those blessings through Christian faith.\nIf a person is baptized and then rejects Christianity, that person forfeits the blessings of baptism. If the Holy Spirit changes the heart of that person and it becomes the residence of saving faith again, the person enjoys the blessings of baptism once again. There is no command, or even example, in the Bible that tells us we are to be baptized more than once.\nAs you study Scripture, be sure to cling to the Bible\u2019s teachings of Baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper. God guide you in the steadfast confession that \u201cJesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name\u201d (John 20:31)."}
{"prompt": "Theology of 119 Ministries", "completion": "What about 119 Ministries?\n\n\nI am not entirely sure what you would like to know about that organization. What follows are some brief observations on the organization\u2019s stated theology.\nThe organization you referenced does speak of the Trinity, but they promote significant errors in their Statement of Faith. They speak of multiple judgments before God and a literal 1,000-year reign of Christ on earth. I found no mention of the sacraments in their Statement of Faith. Their misunderstanding of Old Testament civil and ceremonial laws is evident in this statement: \u201cAll Scripture (Word) is still true and nothing has been abolished.\u201d The ceremonial laws have been abolished. The tearing of the temple curtain on Good Friday illustrated that (Matthew 27:51). As we are not citizens of Old Testament Israel, the civil laws given through Moses do not apply to us.\nThe chief purpose of God\u2019s law is to point out our sinfulness and show our need for a Savior. The organization you referenced places a different emphasis on the law and people\u2019s obedience of it. They state: \u201cOur obedience is the evidence and substance of our faith.\u201d\nThe substance of our faith is Jesus Christ (Acts 4:12; 1 Corinthians 1:23)."}
{"prompt": "Handling snakes", "completion": "I am a practicing WELS member and would like to know why snake handler churches are wrong in their belief the Holy Spirit will protect them from deadly snake bites while worshiping God.  \n\n\nIt is helpful to look at the context in which \u201csnake handler\u201d occurs. We find this in the closing verses of Mark\u2019s gospel: \u201cHe said to them, \u2018Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well.\u2019 After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and he sat at the right hand of God. Then the disciples went out and preached everywhere, and the Lord worked with them and confirmed his word by the signs that accompanied it\u201d (Mark 16:15-20).\nBefore his ascension into heaven, Jesus commissioned his followers to spread his powerful gospel to the ends of the world. He promised them that there would be powerful, accompanying signs to their preaching. The last verse of that section relates the fulfillment of that promise. The early church\u2019s powerful message about Jesus Christ carried with it the power and authority of God.\nWhile God can certainly do anything, we do not look for or expect God to provide those same miraculous signs today (and handling snakes is just one of those signs). Those signs accomplished their purpose in that they demonstrated that the message of the apostles was not of human origin. The Holy Spirit\u2019s work through the powerful gospel\u2014attested by these powerful signs\u2014brought about rapid growth in the church. There is no longer a need for these signs today. Those who expect them or demand them by drinking deadly poison or handling dangerous snakes in the name of the Lord can very well tempt God (Matthew 4:7).\nWe do best to keep the emphasis on what is most important\u2014and certain\u2014in that section of Scripture: proclaiming the powerful gospel of Jesus Christ."}
{"prompt": "God's communication to prophets", "completion": "I was asked a couple of questions in my lay-led Bible class at the assisted living facility and didn't have the answers. I am hopeful somebody can help me. We are going through the book of Joshua.\r\n\r\n1) How did God speak to Joshua? Was it vocal, visions, or some other way?\r\n\r\n2) This led into the question of what does it mean to \"have The Spirit live in us\" and \"full of The Spirit?\" Was God speaking to Joshua through The Spirit living in him?\r\n\r\nI appreciate any insight or thoughts you can share with me concerning this. Thanks!\n\n\n\u201cIn the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom also he made the universe\u201d (Hebrews 1:1-2). While the Bible informs us that God spoke through the prophets \u201cin various ways,\u201d it does not always indicate the specific way in which God communicated to those men in a given section of Scripture. As you indicated, God\u2019s communication could have been through \u201cvocal, visions, or some other way\u201d (Numbers 27:21).\nThe Bible does speak of God\u2019s Spirit living in Christians. \u201cDon\u2019t you know that you yourselves are God\u2019s temple and that God\u2019s Spirit dwells in your midst?\u201d (1 Corinthians 3:16) \u201cDo you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God?\u201d (1 Corinthians 6:19) \u201cNow it is God who makes both us and you stand firm in Christ. He anointed us, set his seal of ownership on us, and put his Spirit in our hearts as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come\u201d (2 Corinthians 1:21-22). \u201cBecause you are his sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, \u2018Abba, Father\u2019\u201d (Galatians 4:6).\u201d And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit\u201d (Ephesians 2:22).\u201d\nYou might be interested in using The People\u2019s Bible for Joshua in your Bible class preparation.\u00a0God\u2019s blessings on your Bible study!"}
{"prompt": "Devotional materials", "completion": "If WELS and LCMS are not in fellowship, why does my WELS church provide Portals of Prayer as a devotional in our narthex as a service to our members?  For a donation I can pick up a copy of Meditations as well as Portals of Prayer on any Sunday.  This has been going on for decades.  Could it be that fellowship has become a more relative term nowadays and is no longer strictly enforced?  \n\n\nThis is a question you want to direct to the individuals who are responsible for the distribution of devotional materials in your congregation. While the synod controls the content of materials available from Northwestern Publishing House, it does not monitor materials at the local level. That is why you want to re-direct your question."}
{"prompt": "Witnessing to Jehovah's Witnesses", "completion": "Sorry to ask a question again so soon, but I was just visited by Jehovah's Witnesses.  They asked me a question that I didn't know how to respond to. They asked me, \"How could Jesus be God if He died on the cross? Does that mean that one person of the Trinity ceased to be for three days, and that for the three days Christ was in the grave, only the Father and Spirit existed?\" What is the proper response to these questions?\n\n\nNot long before Jesus died on the cross, he promised the repentant thief: \u201cTruly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise\u201d (Luke 23:43). How could Jesus make that promise? The Bible teaches that when people die, their body and soul separate (Ecclesiastes 12:7). When Jesus and the repentant thief died, their bodies remained on earth, but their souls immediately went to heaven. Before he died, Jesus said, \u201cFather, into your hands I commit my spirit\u201d (Luke 23:46).\nWhile Jesus\u2019 lifeless body lay in the grave, his soul was in heaven. On Easter Sunday, Jesus\u2019 body and soul were reunited in the grave.\nThis is what the Bible teaches. You want to be aware that the official teachings of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses deny that Jesus Christ rose physically from the dead and that people have both a body and a soul.\nGod bless your witnessing efforts!"}
{"prompt": "Circumcision and New Testament", "completion": "What is role of circumcision and the New Testament?\n\n\nWhile circumcision was a requirement for God\u2019s Old Testament people of Israel, it is no longer obligatory for followers of God in the New Testament age. The New Testament makes that clear. \u201cCircumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God\u2019s commands is what counts\u201d (1 Corinthians 7:19). \u201cFor in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love\u201d (Galatians 5:6). \u201cNeither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything; what counts is the new creation\u201d (Galatians 6:15). Circumcision was part of God\u2019s Old Testament ceremonial laws."}
{"prompt": "Officiant at wedding", "completion": "My sister recently got engaged. We have a cousin who is a staff minister. Would he be able to conduct the wedding?\n\n\nState laws determine who can officiate at weddings. You will want to understand what the laws of your state are in this regard.\nIt goes without saying that if your cousin officiates at the wedding, good order in the church (1 Corinthians 14:40) means involving the pastor(s) of your congregation in the discussion and decision of this matter."}
{"prompt": "Staff ministers and pastors", "completion": "With such a pastor shortage, why don\u2019t we just have congregations go to one pastor, then have staff ministers help the pastor? We have a staff minister at our church and he is basically an associate pastor. Why doesn\u2019t the WELS just do this until the pastor shortage is lessened?\n\n\nMinistry staffing decisions are made at the congregational level. Congregations can receive guidance on staffing needs at the circuit, district and synodical levels, but congregations are entrusted with assessing their ministry needs and calling qualified individuals to meet them.\nWith a shortage of pastors, staff ministers are certainly in a position to help meet the ministry needs of congregations. Students who prepare for staff ministry receive basic theological skills and practical skills to focus on specific areas of parish ministry. They do not receive the training to replace the sole pastor of a congregation.\nWhen congregations consider adding to or replacing ministry staff, they will want to examine their preaching needs. If they need additional preaching assistance, they will want to call a pastor. If current staffing meets their preaching needs but they want a called worker to focus on other areas of ministry such as visitation, outreach, youth and family, administration, Christian education within the congregation or parish music, then a staff minister can serve them well.\nIt sounds like you are well acquainted with the staff ministry program of our synod.

As \u201cGod is spirit\u201d (John 4:24), Jesus had no physical body prior to his conception by the Holy Spirit and his birth at Bethlehem.\nThere were times in the Old Testament (for example, Genesis 16:7-12 and Genesis 22:11-19) when Jesus, prior to his incarnation, appeared to people as \u201cthe angel of the Lord.\u201d\nPraise God that Jesus took on human flesh \u201cto destroy the devil\u2019s work\u201d (1 John 3:8)!"}
{"prompt": "Reception of Holy Communion", "completion": "As an unconfirmed attendant of a WELS church, debating confirmation, I have several concerns that my pastor was not able to fully clarify (this is more on my end than his), such as Communion. Occasionally, due to my familial ties, I often am forced to attend a very large church that has teachings very different from Lutheran teachings. I was originally baptized there due to various emotional manipulations by the elders and preacher (they hate the term \"pastor\"), and as such am expected to take Communion there. Due to various reasons, renouncing my former church is nearly impossible, so should I refuse Communion there (they reject Lutheran teachings on Holy Communion, often violently)? Having already come to the conclusion that their church is invalid in all ways, is it sinful to continue to receive Communion there? Likewise, are there any circumstances where taking Communion outside of WELS (if I am confirmed) is permissible, such as at a funeral service at a Lutheran church with open communion, or an area without a WELS church, or one in communion with WELS?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.\n\n\nChurch membership is a way in which Christians acknowledge Jesus before others (Matthew 10:32) and publicly indicate their unity in faith and doctrine with fellow believers. The reception of Holy Communion is an expression of unity and fellowship with others who receive it (1 Corinthians 10:17).\nIf you were to receive Holy Communion at the church which rejects \u201cLutheran teachings on Holy Communion,\u201d your actions would be saying that you agree with that church and that you also reject Lutheran teachings on Holy Communion. I am wondering if you want to say that or if you want to say, by your actions, that you agree with Lutheran, biblical teachings on Holy Communion. If you have \u201calready come to the conclusion that their church is invalid in all ways,\u201d I do not know why you would want to identify with them by receiving Holy Communion with them.\nRecognizing that the reception of Holy Communion is an expression of unity and fellowship, we want to worship at and receive the sacrament only at those churches with which we enjoy fellowship. The expression of oneness in receiving the sacrament with others is to be genuine and not contrived (1 Corinthians 10:17).\nI encourage you to discuss these matters more thoroughly with the pastor of the WELS church where you are attending. He is in a much better position than I to walk you through Scripture passages that address your questions and concerns. God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Daughter's behavior", "completion": "I am looking for some spiritual advice. I have a 15-year-old who is rebellious, disrespectful, argumentative, defiant and self-centered. A family member told me that she is only a child and Satan is filling her head full of lies. They stated she is not doing this but Satan is and have told her this as well.  They feel she should not be held accountable.  I feel it is causing more behavioral problems and teaching her that parents are not to be honored.\r\nI believe there is \u201cfree will\u201d and at this age she should have a better understanding of right and wrong. \r\nCan you please give me some biblical advice, as this behavior is getting out of hand and I am not sure how much longer we can endure it as we are becoming concerned for our safety and scared that she may create other problems and lies to get revenge on us.\r\nThanks.  \n\n\nI am sorry to read about your daughter\u2019s situation. I can briefly address the spiritual part of your question and then suggest what you can do so you both receive the help you need.\nSatan certainly is our powerful enemy who seeks to destroy us (1 Peter 5:8). What we also have to recognize is that part of us is an ally of Satan: our sinful nature wants nothing to do with God or his word (Galatians 5:17). The Bible describes what the sinful nature is capable of producing (Galatians 5:19-21). We are accountable for what we do and say and think; we cannot simply blame Satan for our sins.\nYour daughter certainly needs the messages of law and gospel from God\u2019s word. I hope she is receiving them from worship attendance, family devotions and personal Bible reading.\nWhat I would encourage you to do is seek Christian counseling for your daughter and yourself. If you have not spoken to your pastor about your situation, please do so. You may also be interested in the counseling services provided by Christian Family Solutions, an agency within WELS. They offer in-person counseling and video counseling from the privacy of your home. Counseling can uncover and address the issues that are complicating your life and your daughter\u2019s life. I encourage you to explore this option. God bless you and your daughter."}
{"prompt": "When a church closes", "completion": "In the unfortunate case when a congregation has to close, how does the church handle the remaining members if there are no WELS/ELS congregations nearby. \n\n\nThe pastor or circuit pastor will advise the members of their options. Options might include periodic visits by a neighboring pastor, lay-assisted services using printed and digital worship materials, a possible re-start of the congregation, among others. Because congregational and community circumstances vary, the options are going to vary as well.\nCongregations do well to learn about and utilize the resources available from WELS Congregational Counseling.\nWhen a congregation has to close, it is an emotional time for all involved. What church leaders are primarily concerned about is that the people involved stay connected to the means of grace."}
{"prompt": "WELS and AFLC", "completion": "I work with a variety of conservative religions--Baptist, Free Lutheran, Catholic, etc. I grew up in the WELS, but have a difficult time answering the question about why there is a difference among Lutheran groups, as in \"aren't they all the same conservative group?\"  Can you give me information on how the AFLS is different from the WELS in particular?  I understand the Baptist and Catholic viewpoints overall, but the Lutheran groups can be confusing, especially when trying to explain. Thanks for your help!\n\n\nI am wondering if you are seeking information on the AFLC (the Association of Free Lutheran Congregations). With that in mind, by looking at their website, a couple of differences between the AFLC and WELS stand out.\nIn the area of church polity they state, \u201cAccording to the Word of God, the congregation is the right form of the Kingdom of God on earth\u2026.According to the New Testament, the congregation needs an external organization with membership roll, election of officers, stated times and places for its gatherings, and other similar provisions.\u201d While we teach the importance of local congregations, we do not make it \u201cthe right form of the Kingdom of God on earth,\u201d nor do we mandate its organizational structure.\nWhen it comes to the application of biblical fellowship principles, the AFLC maintains: \u201cWe recommend that our congregations cooperate wherever possible with like-minded Lutheran congregations and movements in programs of evangelism and witness\u2026.We envision opportunities for our congregations to cooperate with the Protestant churches in the areas of evangelism and witness to their communities. However, care must be taken not to compromise the Lutheran understanding of the Scriptures.\u201d Cooperating with Protestant churches in evangelism blurs biblical fellowship principles.\nThe AFLC is not a synod. It is a fellowship of independent congregations.\nAgain, I trust this is information you were seeking. To gain a better understanding of Lutheranism in our country, you or your friends might be interested in WELS & Other Lutherans. It is available from Northwestern Publishing House."}
{"prompt": "Christian mysticism", "completion": "What is the WELS stance on the text The Cloud of Unknowing?\n\n\nI am sorry, but I am not able to provide reviews of books and texts. All I can say is that we need to beware of Christian mysticism\u2014the idea that we can \u201cexperience\u201d God apart from his Word. While God provides information about himself through his creation (Psalm 19:1; Hebrews 3:4) and our consciences (Romans 2:14-15), God reveals himself as a forgiving God in his word (2 Timothy 3:15). We want to focus our attention on Scripture (Luke 11:28)."}

You will find good reading there."}
{"prompt": "The importance of Lent", "completion": "How does the Wisconsin Synod view the importance of Lent?\n\n\nAlong with many other Christians throughout the world, we consider the season of Lent to be important because it provides the opportunity\u2014often through special, midweek worship services\u2014to focus attention on the redeeming work of Jesus Christ. Jesus saved us by being our perfect substitute in life (Romans 5:19) and our innocent substitute in death (2 Corinthians 5:21). Lent furnishes opportunities to marvel at the forgiving, sacrificial love of God (Isaiah 53). The emphasis of Lent is not what we might give up for God. The emphasis is on what God gave up for us: his only begotten Son (John 3:16).\nWe do recognize that the Christian Church developed the church calendar, including the season of Lent, in Christian freedom. That means that there is no command of God to celebrate Lent, but there are many good reasons to observe that season. In Christian freedom we use the forty days of Lent as a special time of repentance and a time to prepare our hearts to observe the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead."}
{"prompt": "Confessing sins to God", "completion": "During the general confession (non-private), do I have to bring/mention my sins mentally before God for Him to forgive them? The liturgy moves too fast and I don't have time to silently bring my sins before God. Does that matter, or are all my sins forgiven anyway?\n\n\nAs opposed to private confession when we might confess specific sins, the general confession in our worship services provides the opportunity to confess our sinfulness (our sinful nature) and our sins of thought, word and deed (both sins of commission and sins of omission). You are correct in observing that the pace of the liturgy does not allow for enumeration of our sins.\nYou and I also recognize that we cannot list all our sins before God. We may not even be aware of some of the wrong things we do and the good things we fail to do (Psalm 19:12).\nCertainly, you can use the quiet time before the worship service begins to confess specific sins to God. There are helpful resources in our hymnal to assist you with that.\nThe wonderful news about the confession of sins is the promise that God gives in his word: \u201cIf we confess our sins, he [God] is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness\u201d (1 John 1:9). Remember that, and keep in mind that we stand in grace before God (Romans 5:2)."}
{"prompt": "Meaning of \"folly\"", "completion": "Could you please explain the meaning of the word \"folly\" which is in Mark 7:22, and also what may be some current examples of this in our society? Thank you.\n\n\nThe meaning of the Greek word is \u201cfoolishness, lack of sense: moral and intellectual.\u201d\nWe can find current examples of this in our society simply by looking at the sins Jesus mentioned in Mark 7:21-22. The commission of those sins indicates a lack of moral sense. As Jesus pointed out, such sins flow from within\u2014from hearts that are sinful by nature.\nThis is why we confess that we are naturally sinful and that we have sinned against God by our thoughts and words and deeds. Through the power of the Holy Spirit, we also confess that we have forgiveness for our sins through Jesus, who lived perfectly in our place and endured the punishment our sins deserved."}
{"prompt": "Bible translation for devotional usage", "completion": "Is an NRSV with Apocrypha an acceptable Bible to use for devotional purposes?\n\n\nThe New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) is a 1989 revision of the Revised Standard Version (RSV), which first appeared in 1952. Both versions are products of the National Council of Churches.\nWhile the NRSV updated the English language of the RSV, it retained some of its objectionable features. Probably most noteworthy is its denial of the prophecy of the virgin birth of Christ (Isaiah 7:14).\nWhile the apocryphal books are not canonical, they can serve as useful reading materials. Martin Luther included them between the Old Testament and the New Testament in his German Bible. He did so with the instruction that, while the books can provide useful reading, they are not to be considered on the same level as the canonical books.\nI would encourage you to use a different, more reliable Bible translation for your devotional purposes. If you use the one about which you are inquiring, you would do well to use another, more reliable Bible translation alongside it. This link will take you to the Bible translations offered by Northwestern Publishing House."}
{"prompt": "Dealing with sins of past", "completion": "Back in high school I made a huge mistake of having sex with one guy. I didn\u2019t know Christ fully, but I came to Christ three years later. But the past still haunts me. I\u2019m 23, still single and haven\u2019t dated since then. Is it possible of bearing the consequences now for my past sin, even though I\u2019ve gotten baptized and have been serving at church? Does God ever punish us for past sin, or is that the enemy sending those thoughts? \n\n\nSatan thrives on accusing Christians of their sins (Revelation 12:10). Thankfully, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, became man to destroy the devil\u2019s work (1 John 3:8). Jesus did just that by resisting Satan\u2019s temptations (Matthew 4:1-11) and by crushing him (Genesis 3:15) through his atonement for sin and triumphant resurrection from the dead.\nThe comforting message of the Bible is that \u201cThere is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus\u201d (Romans 8:1). Jesus Christ was punished for your sins (2 Corinthians 5:21). God does not punish Christians for sins they commit. God may discipline his children (Hebrews 12), but his motive is love and correction not punishment.\n\u201cIf we confess our sins, he [God] is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness\u201d (I John 1:9). It sounds like you have confessed the sin that remains in your memory. With that being the case, cling to the gospel message that your sins are forgiven.\nWhen God forgives sins, he blots them out of his memory (Isaiah 43:25). The fact that you can remember your sin from the past does not mean that your sin is not forgiven. It means\u2014in a sense\u2014that you have a better memory than God.\nI encourage you to use God\u2019s gospel in word and sacrament faithfully to grow in the confidence and conviction that God has forgiven all your sins for Jesus\u2019 sake. Remember your baptism. In it, God clothed you with the garments of salvation Jesus won for you by his holy life and innocent death (Galatians 3:26-27). Seek the counsel of your pastor or other trusted Christian counselor if you need further assistance in dealing with the past. God bless you!"}
{"prompt": "Remembering Baptism", "completion": "I have been 'baptized' twice, first by my mother and once in a Baptist church. The Baptist church baptism is the only one I have documentation for, even though it came second. Even though my mother baptized me first and would have used the Trinitarian formula, I can't actually remember it, and have no documentation. Which one should I view as my one and only baptism?\n\n\nIf you were baptized following the Bible\u2019s directive of using water and the word of God, you were the recipient of a legitimate Baptism. It sounds like your second Baptism was not necessary.\nRather than focusing on differentiating between your Baptisms, I would encourage you simply to focus on the blessings of Baptism. \u201cSo in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ\u201d (Galatians 3:26-27)."}
{"prompt": "Holy Communion liturgy", "completion": "Why at Communion does the pastor only say, \"Depart in peace,\" and no longer adds, \"and sin no more\"? I know it's been changed for some time, but I keep forgetting to ask.\n\n\nI cannot say that I have heard those words of dismissal at Holy Communion worship services. What I often hear is something along the lines of \u201cThe true body and blood of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ strengthen and preserve you in the true faith unto life everlasting. Depart in peace. Amen.\u201d Variations of that go back well over one thousand years in liturgies of the Christian Church.\nBecause there is no divinely-mandated liturgy, Christians have, in freedom, developed liturgical practices that reflect biblical teaching.\n\u201cDepart in peace\u201d has us think of Simeon\u2019s words (Luke 2:29). And in the Song of Simeon in the Common Service (Christian Worship, page 24), we utilize more of Simeon\u2019s words. \u201cSin no more\u201d points to Jesus\u2019 words to the woman who had been caught in adultery. After assuring her that he did not condemn her for her sins, Jesus instructed her to leave \u201cher life of sin\u201d (John 8:11).\nThe more common dismissal of \u201cDepart in peace\u201d puts emphasis on the peace that comes through the forgiveness of sins. As a response to God\u2019s forgiving love, we certainly want to avoid sin as best we can (and the gospel provides strength for that), but the final instruction of \u201csin no more\u201d can leave the communicant with more thoughts of sanctification (living for God) than justification (God\u2019s decree of \u201cnot guilty\u201d to sinners) right after receiving the sacrament. Also, if the words of dismissal are intended to be words of blessings, an instruction to \u201csin no more\u201d goes beyond \u201cwords of blessings.\u201d\nFinally, Scripture does not tell us what words to use when dismissing communicants\u2014or that we even have to use such words in the first place. Whatever words we do use at the end of the distribution, we want them to reflect the truths of the Bible."}
{"prompt": "Differences between synods", "completion": "What is the difference between this synod and the Missouri Synod? Any theological variance, or just geographic? I was raised in the Missouri Synod and, due to relocation, am looking for a new church to call home. \n\n\nThe main differences fall in the categories of church and ministry, the application of fellowship principles, and the roles of men and women.\nThere are many, many essays on the Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary Essay File that document the history, theology and practices of the two synods, and their relationship to one another throughout the years. This link will take you to those essays.\nYou will also find other questions about WELS and LCMS in the Church and Ministry category of the Q & A section of this website.\nYou might also be interested in A Tale of Two Synods, a book that is available from Northwestern Publishing House.\nFinally, if there is a WELS church in your new community, do contact the pastor.

{"prompt": "Resurrection accounts in the Bible", "completion": "As Lutherans, we believe that immediately upon death, our soul enters either heaven or hell - there is no \u201cmiddle\u201d state, such as the Catholic teaching of purgatory.\r\nHowever, the Bible clearly teaches of Christ raising people from the dead as part of his array of miracles. So that leads me to wonder...as WELS Lutherans/Christians, where do we profess those souls went after death, and how do we reconcile that belief to our standard \u201cpost-death\u201d belief?\r\nTake, as an example, Lazarus.  We can logically conclude that Lazarus, as a believer, would have immediately entered heaven upon his death. But from what we know of heaven, those who entered heaven would be devastated to be \u201cpulled\u201d from the perfect existence of heaven back into this veil of tears. (In fact, in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, we clearly see God rejecting the notion of \u201csending back\u201d people to earth after death.)\r\nSo, what is our teaching/belief-set here? Or is this just one we throw our hands up and say that we really do not know?\r\n\n\n\nThe Bible teaches that the body and soul separate at death (Ecclesiastes 12:7) and there is judgment (Hebrews 9:27). The soul goes to heaven or hell; there is no in-between place like purgatory, as you noted.\nWhen it comes to the biblical accounts of people who were raised from the dead (in Old or New Testament times), Scripture is silent on the specifics and whether or not God might have brought about exceptions to what normally happens.\nWe have to be content with what the biblical accounts teach us. What they teach is that Jesus has conquered death, and he shares his victory with those who are united to him in faith (John 11:25-26; 2 Timothy 1:10; Revelation 1:17-18).\nIn regard to the account of the rich man and Lazarus, Jesus\u2019 point was that the rich man\u2019s brothers had what they needed to avoid an eternity in hell: they had the Old Testament Scriptures. The Holy Spirit works through the word of God to create saving faith in Jesus Christ, the Messiah, and give people forgiveness of sins and heaven as their home. The truth in the biblical account is that if the rich man\u2019s brothers rejected the word of God, \u201cThey will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead\u201d (Luke 16:31)."}
{"prompt": "WELS' confession regarding salvation", "completion": "My grandma is a WELS Lutheran, but my grandpa was Catholic. Everyone in my family was raised and are practicing Catholics.  My grandma's WELS pastor told her (in front of my aunts and uncles- at her sister's funeral) that he felt bad that her children and grandchildren are not saved and that we are all doomed to hell. Is this really what the WELS religion believes?\n\n\nI was not privy to the conversation you referenced, but I can tell you what we in our church body believe about salvation.\n\u201cWe believe that God has justified all sinners, that is, he has declared them righteous for the sake of Christ. This is the central message of Scripture upon which the very existence of the church depends. It is a message relevant to people of all times and places, of all races and social levels, for \u2018the result of one trespass was condemnation for all men\u2019 (Romans 5:18). All need forgiveness of sins before God, and Scripture proclaims that all have been justified, for \u2018the result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men\u2019 (Romans 5:18).\n\u201cWe believe that individuals receive this free gift of forgiveness not on the basis of their own works, but only through faith (Ephesians 2:8,9). Justifying faith is trust in Christ and his redemptive work. This faith justifies not because of any power it has in itself, but only because of the salvation prepared by God in Christ, which it embraces (Romans 3:28; 4:5). On the other hand, although Jesus died for all, Scripture says that \u2018whoever does not believe will be condemned\u2019 (Mark 16:16). Unbelievers forfeit the forgiveness won for them by Christ (John 8:24).\n\u201cWe believe that there is one holy Christian church, which is the temple of God (1 Corinthians 3:16) and the body of Christ (Ephesians 1:23; 4:12). The members of this one church are all those who are the \u2018sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus\u2019 (Galatians 3:26). The church, then, consists only of believers, or saints, whom God accepts as holy for the sake of Jesus\u2019 righteousness, which has been credited to them (2 Corinthians 5:21). These saints are scattered throughout the world. All people who believe that Jesus is their Savior from sin are members of the holy Christian church, regardless of the nation, race, or church body to which they belong.\n\u201cWe believe that this holy Christian church is a reality, although it is not an external, visible organization. Because \u2018man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart\u2019(1 Samuel 16:7), only the Lord knows \u2018those who are his\u2019 (2 Timothy 2:19). The members of the holy Christian church are known only to God; we cannot distinguish between true believers and hypocrites. The holy Christian church is therefore invisible and cannot be identified with any one church body or with the total membership of all church bodies.\u201d\nThose statements are from This We Believe, a statement of belief of our church body. The first two paragraphs are from the section titled \u201cJustification by grace through faith.\u201d The last two paragraph are from the section titled \u201cChurch and ministry.\u201d This link will take you to the complete document. I hope this information is helpful for you."}
{"prompt": "Certainty of salvation", "completion": "I've recently been having anxiety about what if I don't end up going to heaven when I die. How do I know for certain that I'm saved? Can you also recommend some Bible passages that I should look up?\n\n\nWhen it comes to the certainty of our salvation, we want to look to God and not ourselves. Here are some Bible passages that you can think about.\n\u201cYou guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will take me into glory\u201d (Psalm 73:24). This is the confidence we can have because salvation is God\u2019s work.\n\u201cFor God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life\u201d (John 3:16). Notice God\u2019s promise. Notice \u201cwhoever believes.\u201d\n\u201cMy sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand\u201d (John 10:27-28). Jesus said he gives his followers eternal life.\n\u201cI am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die\u201d (John 11:25). You have Jesus\u2019 promise of eternal life.\n\u201cFor the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord\u201d (Romans 6:23). Eternal life is God\u2019s gift to you.\n\u201cHe [God] saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy\u201d (Titus 3:5). If any part of salvation were up to us, there would be reason for doubt. Because salvation is God\u2019s work, there is every reason for certainty.\n\u201cThis is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins\u201d (Matthew 26:28). When you receive the Lord\u2019s Supper, recognize the forgiveness of sins the Lord is giving you.\n\u201cSo in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham\u2019s seed, and heirs according to the promise\u201d (Galatians 3:26-29). Remember what your baptism says to you each day of life: \u201cI am a child of God.\u201d\nThese are some Bible passages that come to mind. \u201cI do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!\u201d (Mark 9:24). That is what a man said to Jesus one day. It is safe to say that the unnamed man speaks for Christians. We believe, but our faith is imperfect. Again, look to Jesus for the certainty of your salvation. Continue to use God\u2019s gospel in word and sacrament to deepen your faith and bolster your certainty of eternal life. God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Universal ownership of KJV", "completion": "Should every Christian have a copy of the King James Bible?\n\n\nIn all seriousness, if you had been able to ask me this question 300-400 years ago, I would have said, \u201cYes.\u201d That is because if you wanted an English translation of the Bible back then, the King James Version (KJV) was the book to get.\nEven though the KJV has undergone many revisions since its introduction in 1611 (I am not speaking of the New King James Version), the language can be a barrier to many English-speaking people today.\nIf Christians use the KJV and understand it, I say, \u201cKeep reading it.\u201d If Christians use the KJV and do not understand it, I would encourage them to find a reliable, contemporary translation of the Bible they can understand. Ownership of a Bible is one thing. Readability is an entirely different matter.\n\u201cWherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls\u201d (James 1:21, KJV). \u201cTherefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you\u201d (James 1:21, NIV).

Please explain the meaning for it here. With thanks.  \n\n\nBeth (pronounced \u201cbayth\u201d in Hebrew) is the second letter of the Hebrew alphabet. Psalm 119 is a very involved acrostic psalm.

In verses 9-16, each verse begins with a word that starts with Beth (our \u201cB\u201d). The psalm continues with that format, working through the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. It is very difficult to reproduce that technique in an English translation, because the first word of every verse in verses 9-16 would need to begin with an English word that starts with \u201cB.\u201d\nBy the way, if you have often opened up your Bible to Psalm 119, there is probably some explanation for that.

{"prompt": "Purpose of Baptism", "completion": "What is the purpose of baptism? Jesus commands us to repent and be baptized to be saved (i.e. Mark 16:16), but since it is possible to be saved without being baptized, what is the purpose for Jesus wanting us to be baptized? Is it possible that baptism as a means for salvation signifies receiving the Holy Spirit with or without water?\n\n\nBaptism unites people with Jesus in his death and resurrection (Romans 6:1-9; 1 Peter 3:21). Baptism washes away sins and gives people the gift of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38; Titus 3:5-7)\nYou are correct in noting that Baptism is not absolutely necessary for salvation because the Holy Spirit can bring people to saving faith in Jesus Christ through the gospel in Word alone\u2014apart from Baptism. In cases like that, people will still want to be baptized\u2014to do what Jesus says and to receive, in addition to the message of the Bible, another guarantee of God\u2019s love and forgiveness in Christ.\nBaptism is necessary in the sense that the Lord commands us to administer Baptism, and Baptism is a means of grace (Matthew 28:19; Mark 16:16). It is not for us to decide whether or not we are going to do what the Lord says.\nBaptism is important because it is a means whereby the Holy Spirit can work in the hearts of the littlest ones among us and connect them to Jesus Christ in saving faith (Matthew 18:6; 28:19; Acts 2:39).\nBaptism provides real blessings. For that, we thank God."}
{"prompt": "Upside down cross", "completion": "Hi, I see a lot of upside down crosses these days: tattoos on people, posts on social media, drawings on kids' notebooks, etc. I know its origin is biblical, but it doesn't seem like people are using it that way in our world today. Is it supposed to be anti-Christian? Satanic? That's what it feels like to me. I Googled this question and all sorts of conflicting answers popped up, ranging from it's not satanic at all, to that's exactly what it is, to everything in between. What's does our synod teach on this? When I see it--and I see it more and more these days--it gives me the creeps. Thanks so much.  \n\n\nThere are references in non-canonical literature to the manner in which the apostle Peter became a martyr for the faith: being crucified upside down. As a result, an upside down cross became one of the symbols in church liturgical arts for that apostle.\nOver the years, Satanists have used the image of an upside down cross for their own purposes, but their official symbol is the Sigil of Baphomet.\nWith these different meanings in use, you would really need to ask the person who uses an upside down cross what meaning that symbol has for him or her. We do not have any official teaching on this subject."}

I would not expect to recognize Satan either\u2014on the street or elsewhere. He \u201cmasquerades as an angel of light\u201d (2 Corinthians 11:14).\nSatan is the arch-enemy of our faith. How thankful we can be that Jesus successfully completed his mission of destroying the devil\u2019s work (1 John 3:8).

{"prompt": "Hebrews chapter four", "completion": "What does the writer of Hebrews mean here?\r\nHebrews 4:9ff - \r\n\"There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God; for anyone who enters God\u2019s rest also rests from their works, just as God did from his.  Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will perish by following their example of disobedience.\"\r\n\n\n\nThe writer is referring to the spiritual and eternal rest that Christians can look forward to in heaven.\nThe Old Testament Sabbath day pointed ahead to Jesus. He said, \u201cCome to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest\u201d (Matthew 11:28). The rest that people can find in Jesus is that which comes from the forgiveness of sins and the promise of eternal life.\nIn this life, Christians find rest for their souls in the gospel message that their sins are forgiven and they are at peace with God. In the life to come, Christians will have perfect and eternal rest for their souls because they will be forever free from sin and all their spiritual enemies.\nThe writer to the Hebrews encourages Christians to \u201cmake every effort to enter that rest\u201d (Hebrews 4:11). That means that we do what we can to remain connected to Jesus Christ in faith. That means that we use God\u2019s gospel in word and sacrament faithfully. God grant that we do just that."}
{"prompt": "Baptism of grandchild", "completion": "Our son and his wife were both raised Lutheran, he as WELS, and her exact denomination I am uncertain of. They have not attended WELS church for years, and recently he asked for release from the WELS. They currently attend a free church. \r\nThey now have a child and have not yet had him baptized. I am concerned for my grandchild and believe that baptism is commanded and necessary under God's word. \r\nWe ourselves as grandparents are not active members in our current congregation, but are both WELS. \r\nHow can we work and support to get the grandchild baptized without causing friction or concern? I assume that since they don't belong to a WELS and because he requested a release that a WELS pastor will not perform a baptism at this point. How do we proceed? Can I do the act of baptism as a confirmed member of the WELS? Thank you.\n\n\nYou are correct in observing that \u201cbaptism is commanded and necessary under God\u2019s word.\u201d Your concern for your grandchild is very much in place.\nWhile you stated that your son asked for a release of membership, I do not know if he has already been released from membership. Your son may want to contact the pastor of the WELS church to verify his membership status and to ask about the Baptism of his son. The pastor will know how to proceed.\nBaptism is certainly important, but so is the lifelong follow-up of instruction in God\u2019s word. Baptism can plant saving faith in a person\u2019s heart, but that faith needs to be nurtured through faithful application of God\u2019s word. If that nurturing does not take place, faith can weaken and die.\nYou mentioned that you and your wife are not active members in your current congregation. I encourage you and your wife to set a good example for your son and his wife by being active members: faithfully hearing God\u2019s word in church, receiving the Lord\u2019s Supper often and letting \u201cthe message of Christ dwell richly among you\u201d (Colossians 3:16), as evidenced by your personal and family usage of God\u2019s word at home. This godly example will remind all involved how to understand Baptism properly and how not to misunderstand it. Baptism provides great blessings\u2014yes\u2014but faith needs to be maintained and strengthened through faithful use of God\u2019s word. None of us want to fall into the trap of thinking that Baptism exempts us from worshiping the Lord faithfully in church or in our daily, personal lives. I pray that you and your family can resolve this important matter. Speak to your pastor for additional input. God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Congregational decisions", "completion": "Where does it say in the Bible that women can\u2019t vote within the church? In a congregation, who decides when Communion is held, pastor, church council or congregation ?\n\n\nThe Bible does not specifically address your first question. The organizational structure of congregations today is quite different from the first-century church. Because of that, we need to take broad scriptural principles and apply them to the organizational structure we enjoy in our congregations today.\nThose scriptural principles include that of loving head and loving helper (Genesis 2:18; 1 Corinthians 11:3). Regarding your question, this principle means that \u201cWe believe that women may participate in offices and activities of the public ministry except where that work involves authority over men (1 Timothy 2:11,12). This means that women may not serve as pastors nor participate in assemblies of the church in ways that exercise authority over men (1 Corinthians 11:3; 14:33-35).\u201d That statement is from This We Believe, a statement of belief of our church body.\nOn another section of this website, you will find a doctrinal statement on \u201cMan and Woman Roles.\u201d The section of that statement that addresses your first question follows:\n\u201c17. The biblical principle of role relationship applies also to the gatherings of the church. All believers, men and women, will participate at gatherings of worship, prayer, Bible study, and service. The scriptural applications that a woman remain silent (1 Co 14:34) and that a woman should not teach a man (1 Ti 2:11,12) require that a woman refrain from participating in these gatherings in any way which involves authority over men.\n\u201c18. In church assemblies the headship principle means that only men will cast votes when such votes exercise authority over men. Only men will do work that involves authority over men (1 Co 11:3-10; 14:33-35; 1 Ti 2:11,12).\n\u201c19. All Christians, men and women, are to use their God-given gifts to serve each other (1 Pe 4:10). Women are encouraged to participate in offices and activities of the public ministry except where the work involves authority over men.\u201d This link will enable you to read those paragraphs in context.\nWhen it comes to a schedule of Holy Communion worship services, it could be that the pastor and the Board of Elders propose a schedule and then report to the Church Council and/or Voters Assembly for ratification or to pass along that information. Congregational members might be surveyed to indicate their preferences for a Holy Communion Schedule.\nRecognizing the variety of ways that congregations govern themselves, it is probably safe to say that a congregation\u2019s regular Holy Communion schedule often originates with thoughts from its pastor, but then he works through proper channels for the schedule to become the congregation\u2019s.\nIf you have questions about your congregation\u2019s Communion schedule, do speak to your pastor."}

{"prompt": "The Lausanne Covenant", "completion": "What do you know about the Lausanne Covenant?\n\n\nThe Lausanne Covenant was ratified at the International Congress on World Evangelization, held in Lausanne, Switzerland, in July 1974. 2,300 people, representing 150 nations, attended the Congress and were involved in the ratification of the Covenant. Since that time, the Covenant has become a confession of faith for many evangelical ministries and associations.\nFollowing are comments on the Lausanne Covenant that appeared in the Wisconsin Lutheran Quarterly in 1974: \u201cThe Lausanne Covenant, as it is called, commits its signatories both to the infallible authority of the Bible and to Christian social responsibility\u2026..There is much in the 14 articles with which we find ourselves in wholehearted agreement\u2026..It warms the heart to read so forthright a statement on the authority of the Bible in an age in which that authority is so often the victim of the proponents of negative higher and historical criticism\u2026..Article 5 on \u2018Christian Social Responsibility\u2019 offers a fine positive statement of the individual Christian\u2019s responsibility as a member of society. From our viewpoint the statement is weak because it does not supplement its positive emphasis with a negative statement to the affect that the Lord has not made social action a part of the church\u2019s task as such\u2026..The covenant is also deserving of a bouquet for its unequivocal rejection \u2018as degrading to Christ of every kind of syncretism and dialogue which implies that Christ speaks equally through all religions and ideologies\u2019\u2026..As for the Congress itself, it was a thoroughly unionistic enterprise.\u201d\nOur church body\u2019s criticism of the covenant is based not so much on what the Covenant said but on what it did not say. Because evangelicals wrote the Covenant, statements on the sacraments and church fellowship are absent."}
{"prompt": "WELS and LCMS relations", "completion": "I am a practicing WELS member.  Is there any chance the Wisconsin and Missouri Synods reunite in fellowship?  \n\n\nYou may or may not be aware that representatives of the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS), The Lutheran Church\u2014Missouri Synod (LCMS) and the Evangelical Lutheran Synod (ELS) have met annually for the past six years. Together updates from WELS have noted that \u201cThe main purpose of these meetings is to provide the synods with the opportunity to gain a clear understanding of their respective doctrinal positions and how the synods put those doctrines into practice as they carry out their ministry\u2026 None of the participants at these informal meetings anticipate a restoration of church fellowship between ELS/WELS and the LCMS in the near future. Yet, the sessions themselves were once again helpful as areas of agreement, as well as specific differences, were addressed in a cordial but candid manner.\u201d\nThe annual meetings have done much to remove old, inaccurate stereotypes and to replace them with accurate, current information on the doctrinal positions and practices of the church bodies.\nThe ultimate result of these meetings is known to God alone.

What is the WELS response?\n\n\nI can offer you a personal response. By synodical convention resolution, our church body has taken an \u201ceclectic approach\u201d toward the use of Bible translations in publishing our materials. That means authors can indicate which translations they would like used in their works. Individual congregations have always determined for themselves which Bible translation(s) they are going to use for their worship services and Christian educational purposes.\nBecause God has not prescribed how we are to worship him, we enjoy Christian freedom in our worship life. Still, we desire to apply this biblical directive to our worship services: \u201cBut everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way\u201d (1 Corinthians 14:40).\nWhen it comes to the public ministry, I can direct you to these words from This We Believe, a statement of belief of our church body: \u201cWe believe that God has also established the public ministry of the Word (Ephesians 4:11), and it is the will of God that the church, in accordance with good order (1 Corinthians 14:40), call qualified individuals into this public ministry (1 Timothy 3:1-10; 1 Corinthians 9:14). Such individuals minister publicly, that is, not because as individuals they possess the universal priesthood but because they are asked to do this in the name of fellow Christians (Romans 10:15). These individuals are the called servants of Christ and ministers of the gospel. They are not to be lords over God\u2019s church (1 Peter 5:3). We believe that when the church calls individuals into this public ministry, the Lord himself is acting through the church (Acts 20:28). We believe that the church has the freedom to establish various forms within the one ministry of the Word, such as pastors, Christian teachers, and staff ministers. Through its call, the church in Christian liberty designates the place and scope of service.\u201d"}

What is the WELS view on blessing animals?\n\n\nWe do not have a practice of blessing animals, nor does the Bible lead us to establish such a practice. We recognize that animals are part of God\u2019s creation (Genesis 1), and pets can provide wonderful companionship. Considering all of God\u2019s creation leads us to praise him: \u201cLord God, open my eyes to the beauty of your created world.

{"prompt": "Agreement in doctrine", "completion": "I respect WELS position on close(d) Communion, but don't fully understand the logic.  In numerous posts you've stated that only God can look into a person's heart, that Christians of other denominations may have saving faith, and the like.  Further, denominations other than WELS believe in the Real Presence of Christ in Communion.  It only makes sense that people should be regularly communing in their own church.  But why do you insist on complete doctrinal agreement on every point  before you allow someone to commune?  After all, at family reunions, not everyone gets along perfectly, but no one is denied the meal.\n\n\nPerhaps it can be helpful if I build off your closing analogy. There is one family of believers, known only to God (1 Corinthians 3:16; Ephesians 1:23; 4:12; 2 Timothy 2:19). Because God alone knows who belongs to that church family, we call it the \u201cinvisible church.\u201d\nYou and I live in the world of \u201cvisible churches\u201d\u2014one in which we can see who belongs to which church. Whether or not people realize it or acknowledge it, their membership in a church states that their faith lines up with that church\u2019s teaching. When it comes to the practice of close communion, it is a matter of comparing the teachings of people\u2019s churches with the Bible\u2019s teachings.\n\u201cHow many of the church\u2019s teachings must line up with the Bible\u2019s teachings for people to commune together?\u201d you might ask. Nowhere does Scripture speak of anything that falls short of complete unity (John 8:31; 1 Thessalonians 5:21-22). In fact, the Bible speaks of the unity that is threatened by the spreading of any false doctrine (Galatians 5:9). The Bible calls upon Christians to be on the lookout for false doctrine, and to avoid it and those who persist in it (Romans 16:17).\nOne of the purposes of close communion is to ensure that, as far as humanly possible, the unity that is expressed by those receiving the Sacrament is genuine and not contrived (1 Corinthians 10:17). It would not be an accurate picture of unity if the people receiving the Lord\u2019s Supper together represented churches that teach doctrines\u2014of any kind\u2014that are contrary to Scripture.\nIf there are visitors to our worship services who belong to churches whose teachings do not agree with biblical teaching, they are certainly welcome to stay and hear the word of God. The Lord directs us to share his gospel message with all people (Mark 16:15). On the other hand, there is no instruction in the Bible that authorizes an indiscriminate distribution of the Lord\u2019s Supper. Visitors to our worship services who belong to churches whose teachings do not agree with biblical teaching may very well be part of the family of God by the saving faith that resides in their hearts. Again, God alone knows that. But if they received the sacrament in our churches, their actions would be saying they are united with our visible church family and its doctrines. Based on the different confessions of both churches, that would not be an accurate statement.\nToday, the family of God is scattered among visible churches. The day will come, of course, when sin and all of its effects\u2014including false doctrine\u2014will no longer exist. Then, the family of God will enjoy perfect peace and unity. And then we will all be guests at the same meal (Revelation 19:9). I hope this response is helpful for you."}
{"prompt": "Certainty of salvation", "completion": "I've been having the fear of Judgement Day recently. What will it be like? Doesn't it say in the Bible that those living today will be judged more harshly than those who died in Sodom and Gomorrah? What does that mean? How will I be judged? Does that leave for a chance that I won't enter heaven?\n\n\n1 Thessalonians 4:13-17 describes what we can expect on Judgment Day. Jesus\u2019 parable of the sheep and the goats (Matthew 25:31-46) informs us that the judgment that took place at people\u2019s death will be made public, and those who are alive on the earth at the time of Jesus\u2019 visible return on the last day will be judged as well. The basis for judgment is faith in Jesus Christ or unbelief (Mark 16:16).\nWhen Jesus sent out his twelve disciples on a preaching mission, he told them: \u201cWhatever town or village you enter, search there for some worthy person and stay at their house until you leave. As you enter the home, give it your greeting. If the home is deserving, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let your peace return to you. If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet. Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town\u201d (Matthew 10:11-15). Jesus\u2019 words in the closing verse tell us that the unbelieving people of Sodom and Gomorrah will face eternal suffering, but the people who rejected the Lord\u2019s own apostles can expect even greater suffering. The Bible does teach degrees of suffering in hell.\nYou and I will be judged like everyone else in the world: on the basis of what was in our hearts when life on earth came to an end. Because salvation is God\u2019s work and because saving faith is God\u2019s gift (Ephesians 2:8-9), you and I can have absolute confidence in God\u2019s decree of \u201cnot guilty.\u201d You and I can share in the apostle Paul\u2019s attitude, as he thought about the last day: \u201cI have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day\u2014and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing\u201d (2 Timothy 4:7-8).\nWhen we look to ourselves and remember some of our sins, we can have doubts about our status in God\u2019s family and our future in God\u2019s kingdom. On the other hand, when we look to Jesus\u2014what he has done as our Savior and the sure promises he has made\u2014those doubts can lessen and disappear. I encourage you to look more to Jesus. He lived up to his name, which means \u201cSavior.\u201d That brings certainty to our lives. God bless you."}

But, since the demands of the law are so hard, isn't not doing good works all the time a sin? Because if I am not helping my neighbor, but doing something for myself, I am not keeping the law intentionally. \r\n\r\nThanks.  \r\n\r\n\n\n\nThe law of God points out our sinfulness and our need for a Savior. It is through the gospel that God offers and gives us his grace, the forgiveness of sins. The means of grace is the gospel in Word and sacraments (Romans 1:16).\nGod creates saving faith through the means of grace, and God strengthens saving faith through the means of grace (Romans 10:17). To grow in your faith, you will want to be faithful in using God\u2019s word and in receiving the Lord\u2019s Supper.\nYou are correct in noting that our good works do not contribute to our salvation. That is very clear from Titus 3:4-7. Jesus alone is Savior.\nWhen it comes to our sins, we confess this in the Common Service: \u201cHoly and merciful Father, I confess that I am by nature sinful and that I have disobeyed you in my thoughts, words, and actions. I have done what is evil and failed to do what is good. For this I deserve your punishment both now and in eternity. But I am truly sorry for my sins, and trusting in my Savior Jesus Christ, I pray: Lord, have mercy on me a sinner.\u201d We confess our natural sinful condition, and we confess our sins of commission and sins of omission.\nThere are sins of weakness, and there are willful, deliberate sins. You are correct in observing that willful, deliberate sins can cause a person to fall from faith. Recognizing who we are by nature and what we do every day explains why there is a need for contrition and repentance each day of our lives. At the same time, there is also reason to look in faith to Jesus and his salvation each day of life."}
{"prompt": "John the Baptist's Baptism", "completion": "What should we understand as \"a baptism of repentance\" for the remission of sins? Mark 1:4; Luke 3:3. Is repentance worked by baptism? People came \"confessing their sins\" and then were baptized. Did John's baptism convey the remission of sins? the gift of the Spirit (in light of Acts 19:1-7) Please expound. Thank you.\n\n\nThrough John the Baptist\u2019s preaching, God changed the hearts of people. Sinners were led to confess their sins and acknowledge Jesus of Nazareth as the promised Messiah, the Lamb of God (John 1:29). The Baptism John performed sealed God\u2019s forgiveness to people. The Baptism John performed provided the vehicle through which the Holy Spirit could produce and strengthen faith, and also repentance in people\u2019s hearts. The Holy Spirit changes hearts through the gospel in word and sacrament. John\u2019s Baptism was essentially the same as Christian Baptism.\nIn Acts 19:1-7, the punctuation in our English Bibles has led to some questions over the years. Keep in mind that the biblical writers did not use quotation marks or other grammatical devices that are in our translations.\nWith that in mind, translations like the NIV bring Paul\u2019s words in verse four to a close before the beginning of verse five. They then have Paul re-baptizing the disciples in Ephesus. If Paul\u2019s words in verse four extend to the end of verse five, then Paul was speaking of John the Baptist baptizing people, and Paul simply laid his hands on the disciples. Some translations and most Lutheran commentators understand Paul\u2019s words and actions in that manner."}
{"prompt": "Thanksgiving Day worship services", "completion": "What Psalms are sung on Thanksgiving Day? What Bible passages are read in the church on Thanksgiving day?\n\n\nYou will find \u201clectionaries\u201d on pages 163-166 in Christian Worship: A Lutheran Hymnal. Those lectionaries contain Scripture readings, including Psalms, for worship services.\nPastors might use those Scripture readings for Thanksgiving Day worship services, or they might use other sections of Scripture. We enjoy this kind of Christian freedom in planning and carrying out our worship services."}
{"prompt": "God's disciplining of Christians", "completion": "What is the difference between divine punishment (or divine wrath as it used to be called) and divine discipline? Several of my relatives claim that the disasters that have befallen our nation are divine judgment for rejecting his message and falling away from its Christian roots. I have been told that God no longer punishes for specific sins and that he instead disciplines his believers, but I'm have trouble understanding the difference. If there is a difference between the two, should I attempt to correct their misconception?\n\n\nThe Bible speaks of Jesus Christ receiving the punishment that a world of sinners deserved (Isaiah 53:4, 8). When people are united to Jesus Christ in faith, they are spared any punishment for their sins (Romans 8:1). What God may do in the lives of Christians is discipline them, not punish them (Proverbs 3:11-12; Hebrews 12:4-12).\nWhen it comes to disasters that strike people, we need to be careful that we do not speak for God when he has not spoken. We do not know his ways, nor can we read his mind (Isaiah 55:8-9; Romans 11:33-36). Jesus instructed us not to assign God\u2019s motives to disasters that involve people (Luke 13:1-9).\nWhen you and I consider life\u2019s difficulties and troubles in view of our sinfulness, we are led to acknowledge with gratitude about God: \u201cHe does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities\u201d (Psalm 103:10). Thanks be to God for his gracious treatment of us."}
{"prompt": "The Lutheran Confessions and inerrancy", "completion": "How is it that confessional Lutherans hold to the \u201cinerrancy\u201d of the Bible when Luther himself advocated for the removal of the books of Hebrews, James, Jude and Revelation from the canon? That to me indicates that Luther himself didn\u2019t view the entire canon as \u201cGod\u2019s word\u201d and found error in it. I could be wrong, but I\u2019ve also been taught that the Lutheran confessions do not mention inerrancy either. Than you.   \n\n\nLike other Christians, Martin Luther voiced opinions about certain books of the Bible. He spoke for himself. His views do not bind the consciences of others, nor do they constitute the foundation of faith. Scripture alone is the foundation of Christian faith (Ephesians 2:20).\nLuther included the books of the Bible you mentioned in his German translation of the Bible. (He also included apocryphal books, and inserted the heading that those books were not to be considered canonical but could serve as useful reading.)\nFor the most part, the Lutheran Confessions addressed doctrines over which Lutherans and the Roman Catholic Church disagreed. If there was agreement (as in the case of the inerrancy of Scripture), there was no need for a separate article on the topic.\nThe Lutheran Confessions do place a high value on Scripture. To see that, you could read the introduction to the Formula of Concord, the Large Catechism and the Smalcald Articles."}
{"prompt": "Contacting straying members", "completion": "Is it correct to make members feel somehow inadequate or sinful if they do not feel they have abilities to contact other members of the church who are delinquent?\n\n\nIt appears that you have information about a situation which I do not. For that reason, I can respond only in general terms.\nWhen it comes to our relationship with fellow believers, we are our \u201cbrother\u2019s keeper\u201d (Genesis 4:9). We have obligations and responsibilities to speak to fellow Christians when they fall into sin (Matthew 18:15-20; James 5:19-20). Love for others (1 John 3:11-24) moves us to action when sin takes a foothold in their lives.\nChurch leaders, including pastors, will want to encourage church members to take these responsibilities seriously and exercise Christian love and concern. Those leaders will certainly want to provide proper, God-pleasing motivation for speaking to fellow members who are not faithful in their use of the means of grace.\nIf, for whatever reason, Christians feel they lack the abilities to speak to straying members of the congregation, the very least\u2014but very important work\u2014they can do is pray for those members. God bless the work of your church in regaining the straying."}
{"prompt": "Anointing with oil", "completion": "I am having a crisis of faith from reading the early church fathers with regard to anointing with oil. The church fathers claim this is just like baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper. Why don\u2019t Lutherans anoint with oil? \n\n\nThe foundation of our faith is Scripture not church fathers. When the Bible speaks of anointing with oil (James 5:14), it does so in the context of receiving medical help. In the Scripture verse just cited, James used a Greek word that speaks of a medicinal use of oil (as in the case of the wounded traveler in the parable of the Good Samaritan in Luke 10:34). James did not use the Greek word that speaks of a ceremonial application of oil. Such application is neither commanded nor forbidden in Scripture."}
{"prompt": "Fear and faith", "completion": "Can you simultaneously have fear and faith in the LORD?\n\n\nYes, and it comes down to how we understand \u201cfear.\u201d The fear that Christians have for God is \u201crespect, awe and reverence\u201d (Psalm 130:4). We trust in God, and we stand in awe of who he is and what he does."}
{"prompt": "\"In Christ Alone\"", "completion": "At worship service today, we sang \"In Christ Alone\" by Keith Getty and Stuart Townsend.  It is one of my favorite Christian songs that I can listen to over and over.  In researching the song today on the internet, I noticed that the PCA of America excluded it from its church hymnal, according to Wiki.  I truly don't understand how such a beautiful song that clearly articulates what Christ did for us can be excluded from any church hymnal.  I would appreciate any insights or thoughts you can offer about why some would think about this song in a negative way.  \n\n\nBack in 2013, the Presbyterian Committee on Congregational Song was interested in including \u201cIn Christ Alone\u201d in the new hymnal for its church body, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). The committee wanted to change a line in stanza two from \u201con that cross, as Jesus died, the wrath of God was satisfied\u201d to \u201con that cross, as Jesus died, the love of God was magnified.\u201d The committee proposed the change because its members did not see room for God\u2019s wrath at the cross of Calvary. When the copyright holders of the song did not approve the proposed change, the committee voted not to include the song in its church body\u2019s new hymnal.\nThe wording that stands (\u201con that cross, as Jesus died, the wrath of God was satisfied\u201d) is biblically accurate. God\u2019s mercy and God\u2019s justice intersect at the cross of Christ. At Calvary, a just God punished people\u2019s sins. At Calvary, a merciful God punished his Son instead of us (Isaiah 53:4-6; Romans 3:22-26; 2 Corinthians 5:21)."}
{"prompt": "Apostolic tradition", "completion": "I know Jesus is the Word, and Scripture is also God's Word, but what about apostolic tradition? Is apostolic tradition the Word of God as Catholics say?\n\n\nNo. Scripture stands alone as God\u2019s written revelation. The inspired writings of the apostles and prophets (Ephesians 4:19-20), not apostolic tradition, form the foundation of the Christian faith.\nGod made it very clear that no one was to add to or subtract from his inspired word (Deuteronomy 4:2; Revelation 22:18-19)."}
{"prompt": "Existence of sin in the world", "completion": "If heaven was a place of perfection, with no trace of sin, and Satan lived there with God and the other angels, where did Satan get the idea to rebel? And why did God allow it, knowing that it would cause so many to fall with him?\n\n\nThe Bible does not provide answers to those questions. Because God is all-powerful, he could have certainly prevented the fall of the angels and the subsequent fall of Adam and Eve. God does not explain why he did not prevent those falls\u2014nor is he obligated to do so (Romans 11:33-36).\nWhat we do know from the Bible is that God promised a Savior to crush the devil (Genesis 3:15), and Jesus Christ did exactly that (1 John 3:8).\nThrough Spirit-worked faith in Jesus Christ, Christians can confidently look forward to an eternal life of perfection with God (Revelation 21:3-4)."}
{"prompt": "Marriage in the Bible and the Confessions", "completion": "About monastic vows, the Augsburg Confession says in the Article XXVII, 18:\r\n\r\n\"18] First, concerning such as contract matrimony, they teach on our part that it is lawful for all men who are not fitted for single life to contract matrimony, because vows cannot annul the ordinance and commandment of God. 19] But the commandment of God is 1 Cor. 7:2: To avoid fornication, let every man have 20] his own wife. Nor is it the commandment only, but also the creation and ordinance of God, which forces those to marry who are not excepted by a singular work of God, according to the text Gen. 2:18: It is not good 21]that the man should be alone. Therefore they do not sin who obey this commandment and ordinance of God.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, it's said that the vow is unlawful and not binding. Doesn't 1 Timothy 5:9-12 appear to teach otherwise?\n\n\nThe section of the Augsburg Confession you cited does speak of the freedom people have to marry or not to marry. 1 Timothy 5:9-12 addresses instructions the apostle Paul gave to Timothy regarding the support of widows. There is no prohibition for widows to remarry. Verse 14 makes that clear. These verses of 1 Timothy 5 and the section from the Augsburg Confession you cited are in agreement."}
{"prompt": "Beliefs and confirmation", "completion": "I was baptized in the Methodist Church when was a child, but never attended the church. I started to attend a Presbyterian Church but didn't make a profession, and I don't know if I will do, because I think that maybe they will ask me if I believe in the Scriptures as explained in the Westminster Confession, and I think that the Book of Concord is more faithful to the Scriptures.\r\n\r\nMy question is: I can't say that I agree 100% with the Lutheran Church, specifically about the doctrine of creation and the doctrine of the end of the times (amillennialism). Would that be an impediment?\r\n\r\nAlso: As I said, I have a lot of doubts about faith, and probably I more disbelieve than believe. Would it be wrong to make a confession of faith in this situation?\r\n\r\nOne more thing: what should be said to someone with scrupulosity and an \"anxious conscience,\" who always is in doubt if something is sin or not?\r\n\r\nAnd what about someone who suffers from OCD and is afraid about disrespecting oaths made in the mind or hastily, or to blaspheme in moments of anxiety and anger?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\n\n\nFor someone in your situation, the route to membership in one of our congregations would be adult confirmation. After attending a series of lessons on the teachings of the Bible, you would be given the opportunity to declare that you believe the instruction you received is biblical and true. Since that instruction would include biblical information on creation and the end times, you do not want to make declarations or promises that are not true.\nOur churches do offer Bible Information Classes (or similarly-named classes) that provide basic instruction in God\u2019s word. There are no commitments in attending the classes. The classes would provide a good forum for you to receive instruction, ask questions and receive answers.\nWhen it comes to faith, many a Christian can identify with the man who approached Jesus one day and said, \u201cI do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!\u201d (Mark 9:24). Faith is strengthened and doubt is lessened the more we use God\u2019s gospel in word and sacrament. Through ongoing use of God\u2019s word, you can better understand your Christian freedom and the proper role of your conscience.\nWhen it comes to the last item you mentioned, you could find it valuable to talk to one of our pastors. God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Infertility and adoption", "completion": "My wife is physically unable to have kids. I knew this before getting married and believed at the time that I may at some point become interested in adopting, though I didn't consider myself ready at the time. A few years later, I still do not feel called to being a parent, and I do not see myself being interested in adopting. My wife is struggling with the lack of having children (especially as compared to our friends who are having children), and I feel like I'm failing her by not wanting children. I feel that if I decided to adopt to make my wife happy, this would not be done out of love for a child, and I wouldn't be operating out of the love that a father should have.\r\n\r\nIs it a sin to not be interested in having children? I have tried to view our situation as a blessing from God as it allows us more opportunities to help others with our free time, but it feels like I am letting my wife down. \r\n\r\nOn a separate note, she is struggling mentally with infertility, and I'm struggling to know how to support her spiritually. It feels like any time a person asks us about children or mentions to her \"how great she would be as a mother\", it sends her on another downward spiral. I'm not sure how to lift her up and any words of support feel like they are hollow.\n\n\nThe Bible calls children a \u201cheritage\u201d and a \u201creward\u201d (Psalm 127:3). Of course, people\u2019s attitudes toward children might or might not agree with that.\nIf a Christian husband and wife are physically able to have children and choose not to have children, they will need to examine their motives to see how they line up with God\u2019s word. Your situation is quite different from that. Still, you and your wife want to understand\u2014and come to an agreement\u2014on other ways in which children might become a part of your family, and that is through adoption.\nI cannot say that it is always sinful for a couple not to want to have children. There might be a concern for the physical, emotional or mental state of one or both spouses. In that case, a desire not to adopt is understandable.\nWhen it comes to your question and the concern how to support your wife emotionally, the best course of action for both of you is to speak to your pastor. If, for whatever reason, that is not an option, Christian Family Solutions, an agency within WELS, offers video counseling from the privacy of your home or counseling in a face-to-face environment. This link will take you to their website.\nAdditionally, you and your wife could benefit from the resources of Christian Life Resources, another agency within WELS. This link will take you to their website. One of the banners at the top of their home page is \u201cFamily Topics.\u201d Underneath that banner are categories like \u201cFertility/Infertility\u201d and \u201cAdoption.\u201d You will find some good reading material there.\nOn a side note, my wife and I adopted our two children 28+ years ago. Every story is different, I know. We went through infertility tests and then went the adoption route: one was an international adoption and the other domestic. For us, it was one blessing from God after another. All these years later, even with an international adoption, my wife and I have to remind ourselves that our children are adopted.\nI hope you have received some help through this response. I really encourage you to follow through with the suggestions for resources that are listed. God bless you and your wife."}
{"prompt": "Homosexual orientation", "completion": "What is the WELS position on homosexual orientation (not actions)? I read the document on this WELS page, but am still unclear on the WELS position. Is it similar to the Catholic position of 'intrinsically disordered, but not in and of it self sin'? I am talking about the orientation/propensity, not actions or desires. Thank you.\n\n\nSince I do not know what you read on our website, let me pass along the following information from the \u201cWhat We Believe\u201d section of our website. It addresses your question.\n\u201cNote on homosexuality as innate or chosen\nSome advocates of legal and religious tolerance of homosexuality claim that homosexuality has a genetic cause. Some reports claim that some homosexual men share a particular pattern in the X sex-chromosome that they received from their mother. Other researchers have claimed the existence of other types of biological similarities between homosexual men. These researchers acknowledge that their discoveries cannot account for all homosexuality and may merely be associated with homosexuality rather than being a direct cause of it. Most researchers conclude that the origins of homosexuality are complex and varied and may never be fully understood.\n\u201cHow should we evaluate such claims in the light of the biblical teaching of sin? Is homosexuality a free choice or an inborn tendency?\n\u201cLike many such either-or questions, this question poses a false dilemma. Every sin is both a choice of the will and the expression of an inborn tendency to sin. Our sinful will is guilty of consent whenever we sin in thought, word, or deed. As a result of our sinful nature we take pleasure in our sins and defend them. This universal tendency is apparent also in the efforts of gay rights activists to condone their homosexuality and to deny that anything is wrong with it.\n\u201cAlthough the consent of our sinful will is present in every sin, it is also true that we are born as slaves of sin. We may also yield to a particular sin so often that we no longer control the sin, but the sin controls us. We may find ourselves yielding to sin even when we don\u2019t want to.\n\u201cSin infects both our body and our soul. The body we now have is not the perfect body that God created for Adam and Eve. It has been contaminated by the effects of sin. There is no reason to maintain that the specific effects of sin have been identical in each one of us or that we are all equally susceptible to every sin. Our individual degree of susceptibility to some specific sins may be due in part to differences in our bodies. Abuse of alcohol and a hot temper are just two examples of sins that may be affected by the chemistry of our bodies. Few would deny that the pressure to sexual sin is greater at 18 than it is at 8 or at 88 and that a primary reason for this is the changing chemistry of our bodies. It may well be that a person\u2019s susceptibility to homosexuality or to certain other sins depends in part on bodily differences.\n\u201cEven though the weakness of our own body may be one factor that leads us to sin, God holds us responsible for all of our sins, even those sins that enslave us and those sins that we are not aware of. We need God\u2019s forgiveness even for those sinful desires that we resist and do not act upon. These desires too are sin. (Read Romans 7 for a treatment of slavery to sin.) Christ\u2019s forgiveness covers every form of every sin for the repentant.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Age of earth", "completion": "I'm in a bit of a debate online about the Young Earth Creationists. It is my understanding that the WELS holds to this theory, due to God creating the universe in 6 days.  \r\n\r\nOne of the counters brought to my attention is in regard to ancient writings and art, seemingly dated at near-our 10,000 year old earth, or older (as in cave drawings and ruins of civilizations).  \r\n\r\nMy question is, how do I address this? What evidence can I present (besides the historicity of the resurrection) to make  our viewpoint more convincing?\n\n\nProbably the best way I can help you is to refer you to the resources of the Lutheran Science Institute, an organization within WELS. There is information on their website that can help address your question.\nOne of the sections on their website is \u201cCreation Apologetics.\u201d Another section is titled \u201cDating Methods.\u201d If you are interested, there is contact information on their website to follow up on your question.\nThis link will take you to the homepage of their website."}
{"prompt": "Reception of the Lord's Supper", "completion": "Can only members can take Communion in WELS?\n\n\nThose who may receive the Lord\u2019s Supper in our churches are members of our congregations and guests from congregations in our fellowship. In the United States, WELS is in fellowship with the Evangelical Lutheran Synod (ELS). Throughout the world, WELS is in fellowship with 30 other Lutheran church bodies.\nYou can find the list of those churches on the website of the Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference (celc.info)."}
{"prompt": "Sponsors for Baptism", "completion": "When having a child baptized in the WELS church, do the godparents/sponsors have to be WELS members? \r\nAlso, is there a certain number of godparents/sponsors a child should have?  \n\n\nFor starters, we recognize that the formal use of sponsors is a church custom. God has neither commanded nor forbidden the practice. In Christian freedom, the practice of sponsors may or may not be utilized.\nOlder liturgies of Holy Baptism in our churches differentiated between witnesses and sponsors. Anyone could serve as a witness to the Baptism. It was different with sponsors. Since sponsors promised to remember the baptized child in prayer, remind the child of his/her Baptism, and offer counsel and assistance in seeing that the child was brought up in the Christian faith, in accordance with the teachings of the Lutheran Church (especially if the child\u2019s parents died), individuals who served as sponsors were to be of the same faith and fellowship. That practice had concern that people not make promises that went against their consciences or religious convictions.\nThe Baptism liturgy in Christian Worship, the hymnal used in most WELS congregations, does not differentiate between witnesses or sponsors. It does not ask questions of people who are standing up with the parents. Instead, the Baptism liturgy asks the members of the congregation if they are willing to assist the parents in bringing up the child in the Christian faith. In a sense, there is a congregation of sponsors for the baptized child. It is possible that the WELS congregation you have in mind uses a different liturgy for Holy Baptism, but if it uses the one in our hymnal, there is not a recognition of sponsors. The individuals standing up with the parents are regarded as witnesses.\nParents might, on their own, designate individuals to have responsibilities as godparents or sponsors. That is entirely up to them.\nSince all of this is a matter of Christian freedom, there is no specified number of individuals who might serve in these roles."}
{"prompt": "Church locator", "completion": "How do I find a list of churches and their locations (addresses) from the WELS website?\n\n\nAt the top of the WELS website home page, you will find a heading \u201cFind a Church/School.\u201d That website feature will enable you to find our churches in various locations."}
{"prompt": "Volunteer firefighter", "completion": "Should a Lutheran become a volunteer firefighter?\n\n\n\u201cShould\u201d they? That course of action is up to individuals. \u201cCan\u201d they? That course of action is certainly available to Christians. Community service like that meets a need and provides opportunity for Christians to let their light shine (Matthew 5:16)."}
{"prompt": "Baptism of teen", "completion": "In the case of an older child (early teens) being baptized, I was surprised to see the pastor have the child hold their hand over the font while he sprinkled the baptismal water on the child's hand instead of having the child bend over the font.  The child looked and acted like any normal, healthy young teen so I saw no reason why they could not have bent their head over the font. This was at a small WELS church in Wisconsin.  Thank you for commenting.\n\n\nThe Greek word \u201cto baptize\u201d or \u201cto wash\u201d did not specify the way in which a person used water (Mark 7:3-4). One of those ways was pouring water over the hands and washing them (Luke 12:37-38).\nA valid Baptism is one in which people apply water and use God\u2019s word. Historically, apart from the practice of immersion, Christians have poured water on the head of the person being baptized. Because departing from that common practice can cause confusion, explanations from the people involved really become important. You would need to ask the pastor who performed the Baptism why he applied water that way."}
{"prompt": "Prayer and troubles", "completion": "We recently attended a Bible study on the Lord's Prayer.  The pastor who led that study stated \"the more you pray, the more trouble will come to you.\" Is this a correct statement?   I thought prayer was supposed to bring relief to the sinner, knowing that if you ask, God will answer.  Also, since God has commanded us to pray, why would He do so if it brings on trouble?\n\n\nAs I do not have the context in which the pastor made that statement, I can only propose a possible meaning. It goes like this: Satan\u2019s goal is to destroy faith. If he sees Christians exercising their faith through prayer, he could very well ramp up his attacks on that person\u2014with the ultimate goal of trying to destroy that Christian\u2019s faith.\nThat is one way of looking at that statement, but you would really need to speak with the pastor who led that Bible study to understand what he meant.\nGod certainly invites and directs us to pray to him (Psalm 50:15; 1 Thessalonians 5:17). God promises to answer our prayers (Matthew 7:7) according to his wisdom and love (2 Corinthians 12:8-9). So, let\u2019s keep conversing with our God through prayer\u2014no matter what troubles Satan may try to throw our way."}
{"prompt": "2 Peter 3:14", "completion": "At first glance, doesn't verse 14 of the 3rd chapter of St. Peter's second Epistle seem to contradict our central teaching of righteousness and salvation by grace alone and by faith alone? \n\n\nYou make a good observation: Bible verses like the one you cited and others (Philippians 2:12, for example) require more than a passing glance to understand them correctly.\nA critical factor in correctly understanding the Bible is keeping the context in mind. In 2 Peter chapter three, the apostle is focusing on the Last Day. After explaining some of the events of that day, Peter offers this instruction: \u201cSo then, dear friends, since you are looking forward to this, make every effort to be found spotless, blameless and at peace with him\u201d (2 Peter 3:14).\nOther parts of the Bible teach that we are blameless in the sight of God because of Jesus\u2019 redeeming work (Ephesians 5:25-27). The apostle Peter\u2019s words instruct Christians to continue in the saving faith so that they are blameless through the forgiveness of sins on the Last Day. Continuing in the saving faith means that Christians use faithfully the means of grace so that the Holy Spirit can strengthen and preserve faith."}
{"prompt": "Churches and close communion", "completion": "If a Lutheran church does not practice closed communion, is it safe to say it is not WELS?\n\n\nThe Evangelical Lutheran Synod (ELS), with whom WELS is in fellowship, also has the practice of close(d) communion.\nRegardless of any inconsistent application, the official practice of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod is also close communion."}
{"prompt": "Judging the living and the dead", "completion": "Are souls of deceased believers in heaven now?  If so, wouldn't that mean their judgement day was when they died instead of when God comes back to judge the living and the dead?\n\n\nYes, the souls of Christians who have died are in heaven now. When death takes place, judgment also takes place (Hebrews 9:27). Jesus promised the repentant thief that he would be in heaven that very day (Luke 23:43). The book of Revelation describes Christians in heaven who were killed for their faith (Revelation 6:9-11).\nOn the Last Day, when Jesus returns visibly to this world, he will judge all people (Matthew 25:31-46). Those who died prior to the Last Day received judgment when they died. On the Last Day, that judgment will be made public. Those who are alive on the Last Day will be judged at that time.\nWhen we know Jesus Christ in faith as our Savior, we know what the Judge will say to us whenever we appear before him. That is our joy and confidence."}

{"prompt": "Sola Scriptura", "completion": "Hello, recently I have been struggling with my Lutheran beliefs and I am now thinking about converting to the Roman Catholic Church. The main problem I have is Sola Scriptura. Can you please show me where in the Bible it teaches Sola Scriptura? The verses that trouble me are 2 Thessalonians 2:15, 1 Timothy 3:15, 1 Corinthians 11:2, and 2 Timothy 2:14. Please help with this.\n\n\nIn the Bible God makes it clear that we are not to add to or subtract from his word (Deuteronomy 4:2; Revelation 22:18-19). The apostle Paul states clearly that God\u2019s word is the foundation of the Christian Church and Jesus Christ is the chief cornerstone (Ephesians 2:20). Jesus tells us to search the Scriptures (John 5:39) and not to look anywhere else for saving truth (Luke 16:29). Jesus rebuked people who added to the word of God (Matthew 15:7-9).\n2 Thessalonians 2:15 \u2013 The apostle Paul taught the Christians in Thessalonica in person (Acts 17) and through his inspired letters to them.\n1 Timothy 3:15 \u2013 God preserves the truth of his word among Christians and looks for his people to proclaim that truth.\n1 Corinthians 11:2 \u2013 The apostle Paul taught the Christians in Corinth in person (Acts 18) and through his inspired letters to them.\n2 Timothy 2:14 \u2013 The apostle Paul wanted Timothy to remind other Christians of what he had just written previously in this inspired letter.\nIf you are seriously thinking of affiliating with the Roman Catholic Church, you want to ask yourself: \u201cDo I want to leave a church that proclaims the biblical truth that we are saved by God\u2019s grace through faith alone in Jesus Christ and join a church that officially\u2014through the Council of Trent\u2014condemns that proclamation?\u201d I pray that answering that question eliminates your struggles."}
{"prompt": "God's modes of presence", "completion": "Matthew 18:20 states that God is with us where two or three gather in his name. I thought God was everywhere...especially when we are alone.\n\n\nThe Bible teaches that God has many different modes of presence. He is omnipresent (Jeremiah 23:24; Psalm 139:7-10). He is present in the Lord\u2019s Supper, as we receive the Lord\u2019s body and blood, together with the bread and wine (1 Corinthians 10:16; 1 Corinthians 11:27). He is present with his church\u2014when two or three come together in his name, as you referenced. He is present with each believer, as our body is a temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19). He is present with each believer because he lives in them (John 17:20-23). Jesus was visibly present among people when he came to this world as true man (1 John 1:1-2). Praise God for the comfort, peace and strength of his ongoing presence in our lives!"}

{"prompt": "Growing in faith", "completion": "How do I build faith and trust in God, rely on Him and not be afraid?\n\n\n\u201cConsequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ\u201d (Romans 10:17). God creates saving faith through the gospel in word and sacrament. God strengthens and preserves saving faith through those same means.\nGod increases faith and trust in him as you use his word and receive the Lord\u2019s Supper. This is why God instructs us: \u201cLet the message of Christ dwell among you richly\u2026\u201d (Colossians 3:16) This is why Jesus invites us to partake of the Lord\u2019s Supper often (1 Corinthians 11:25).\nI encourage you to be faithful in your use of God\u2019s word at home and in church, and to be a frequent guest at the Lord\u2019s Supper.

{"prompt": "Marriage between relatives", "completion": "Does the Bible tell us (and, if so, where?) that it is wrong to marry a sibling and/or cousin?  Obviously, it was permissible (and necessary) for Seth and his siblings to marry each other.  Was it still OK by Abraham's time for him to marry his half-sister?  What about Jacob marrying his first cousin(s)?\n\n\nIn the early part of world history, marriage between people who were related in some close way was inevitable. As time progressed and world population grew, God regulated marriage for his Old Testament people of Israel. In the Sinaitic Covenant, God forbade marriages between close relatives (Leviticus 18-20). That took place some 300 years after Abraham.\nFor people of God in New Testament times, people who are not bound by Old Testament civil laws, we recognize our obedience to the civil laws which are established by governments (Romans 13:1-7). That includes laws that regulate marriage between people who are related by birth.\nAncient Roman laws forbade certain relatives from marrying one another (1 Corinthians 5:1, for example). Similarly, governmental laws today place restrictions on those who want to marry. In our country, these laws vary from state to state."}
{"prompt": "Thoughts of changing membership", "completion": "My wife and I are members of an ELCA church. She joined this church in 1998 and I joined in 2004. She was raised Lutheran while I was raised Baptist. Neither one of us understood that there were separate factions within Lutheranism and that certain beliefs were different. We have stayed with our congregation because the majority of them are like us- we believe homosexuality is a sin and that abortion is murder. Recently we have hired a pastor that is very liberal and is pushing his views on the congregation. The two of us have discussed in length that it is past time for us to find a church that is more in line with our views. The research I have done shows that a WELS congregation would most likely be a better fit for us. My question is how welcome would we be in a WELS congregation if we decide to become members? Will the congregation judge us for being members of an ELCA church? This is very important to me because I have not felt God's presence during worship for a long time and am about to stop going to church altogether. \n\n\nIn the last congregation I served as pastor, I can think of members who had been Roman Catholic, Methodist, Episcopalian, ELCA, Lutheran Church\u2014Missouri Synod, non-denominational\u2014just to name a few. There was not any problem for those people to feel welcome in the congregation. There was a recognition on the congregation\u2019s part that people come into a church family at different times of life and from different backgrounds. What was important was the present common faith.\nI would encourage you and your wife to speak to the pastor of the local WELS congregation.

{"prompt": "Lordship salvation", "completion": "My question is about the object of saving faith. I know it's Jesus, but a lot of Reformed say that it's accepting Jesus as Lord and Savior, and accepting as Lord means to submit to Jesus\u2019 commandments, the called Lordship salvation. Maybe I am misinterpreting, but it seems to me that it's not so different to say that salvation is faith plus law keeping, or submit to the Law. \r\nI read in Clarke\u2019s commentary on Romans (10:9):  \u201cThat if thou shalt confess, etc. - Acknowledge the Lord Jesus Christ as the only Savior. Believe in thy heart that he who died for thy offenses has been raised for thy justification; and depend solely on him for that justification, and thou shalt be saved.\"\r\nWould the confessional Lutherans agree with that definition of the object of faith? If yes, could you give me some biblical proof? Because indeed in Romans 10 Paul says to confess Jesus as Lord.\r\n\n\n\nThe Bible teaches that people enjoy forgiveness of sins and eternal life through faith in Jesus Christ alone (Ephesians 2:8-9). Good works do not play any part in our salvation (Titus 3:4-5).\nWhile it is through faith in Jesus Christ alone that people enjoy salvation, the Bible (especially the book of James) teaches that faith does not exist in a vacuum. Faith is never alone; it displays itself in a life of love. Jesus himself said, \u201cIf you love me, keep my commands\u201d (John 14:15).\nThe Lordship salvation controversy that you referenced describes the approach of some who want to quantify saving faith or add to saving faith as the means to enjoying salvation. The book of Galatians addresses that error.\nSince you mentioned \u201cconfessional Lutherans,\u201d allow me to pass along a couple of appropriate sections from the Augsburg Confession that address your question.\n\u201cAlso they [our churches] teach that men cannot be justified before God by their own strength, merits, or works, but are freely justified for Christ\u2019s sake, through faith, when they believe that they are received into favor, and that their sins are forgiven for Christ\u2019s sake, who, by His death, has made satisfaction for our sins. This faith God imputes for righteousness in His sight. Rom. 3 and 4.\u201d [Article IV: Of Justification]\n\u201cAlso they [our churches] teach that this faith is bound to bring forth good fruits, and that it is necessary to do good works commanded by God, because of God\u2019s will, but that we should not rely on those works to merit justification before God. For remission of sins and justification is apprehended by faith, as also the voice of Christ attests: When ye shall have done all these things, say: We are unprofitable servants. Luke 17, 10. The same is also taught by the Fathers. For Ambrose says: It is ordained of God that he who believes in Christ is saved, freely receiving remission of sins, without works, by faith alone.\u201d [Article VI: Of New Obedience]"}
{"prompt": "Last Day questions", "completion": "I am confused about Judgement Day. So, when we die, our souls go to heaven and we are reunited with all of our loved ones.  But we don't have our bodies yet?  And we are judged at that time?  Then, when Christ returns, the graves open and our bodies are then reunited with our souls in heaven?  So, meantime we are spirits with no bodies?     Then will we have to go to the the judgment all over again, or are only those left on earth judged because we have been judged when we die to enter heaven?   I have heard many sermons and I am still confused. I can understand why the Roman Catholic Church developed the purgatory teaching, which I know is not true. Did that come out of the same confusion I have?\n\n\nLet me try to respond to your questions in the order in which you asked them.\nWhen death takes place, the body and soul separate, and judgment also takes place (Ecclesiastes 12:7; Hebrews 9:27). While their bodies remain on earth, the souls of Christians go to heaven (Luke 23:43; Acts 7:59; Revelation 6:9), while the souls of unbelievers go to hell (Luke 16:23; 1 Peter 3:19-20).\nWhen Jesus returns visibly to this world on the Last Day, he will raise the bodies of all who have died and reunite their souls with their bodies (Daniel 12:2; John 5:28-29).\nJesus will then pronounce judgment on all people (Matthew 25:31-46; 2 Timothy 4:1). The judgments that took place at people\u2019s deaths will be made known to all. Additionally, the Lord will render judgment on those who are alive on the earth at his coming.\nUnbelievers will experience eternal suffering\u2014body and soul\u2014in hell (Matthew 25:41-46), while believers\u2014body and soul\u2014will enjoy a perfect and glorious eternity in the new heaven and new earth (Isaiah 65:17; 66:22; 2 Peter 3:13; Revelation 21:1).\nThe Roman Catholic Church developed the concept of purgatory in the 15th and 16th centuries with the false idea that people who die with a debt of temporal punishment for their sins must atone for those sins in purgatory. That teaching denies the full and free forgiveness Christians enjoy through Spirit-worked faith in Jesus Christ (Acts 10:43; Romans 8:1; Ephesians 1:7; Colossians 1:14).\nWhen you and I have God\u2019s sure promises about what will happen at death and on the Last Day, we have every reason to join in the prayer: \u201cAmen. Come, Lord Jesus\u201d (Revelation 22:20)."}

Thanks.\n\n\nWhen Martin Luther made his courageous stand on God\u2019s word at the Diet of Worms on April 18, 1521, he spoke in German and in Latin. Eyewitness accounts and transcripts of the proceedings vary. Some accounts include \u201cHere I stand\u2026\u201d Others do not. All the accounts are in agreement with the substance of Luther\u2019s words\u2014that he upheld the authority of Scripture and that his conscience was captive to Scripture. Personally, as I think of that dramatic scene, I am happy to include that phrase in Luther\u2019s speech.\nOn October 31, 1517, Martin Luther, accompanied by Johann Schneider, nailed the 95 Theses to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg. He also sent a copy of the Theses to Archbishop Albert of Mainz. Twentieth-century historians questioned whether Luther actually posted the Theses.

{"prompt": "Recreational marijuana legislation", "completion": "My state just voted to approve recreational marijuana.  I have two questions.  One, is it legal for me to use it if my state says, \"Yes,\" but my national law still says, \"No\"?  And two, is it permissible for me to use it as a Christian knowing that God has called me to be \"sober minded\" and I will lose that when I get a high from it?  Or, to ask it another way, is it possible to use this substance \"in moderation\"?\n\n\nSince the Bible does not speak directly to your questions, we need to see how some broad scriptural principles apply.\nFor one thing, there is the matter of governmental authority. We are to obey the authorities whom God has established (Romans 13). We are to obey the laws they enact unless obedience to those laws puts us in conflict with God\u2019s will (Acts 5:29). We recognize that governments may pass ungodly legislation (for example, abortion, no-fault divorce, same-sex marriage), but the governmental freedom to commit sin does not give Christians the green light to sin.\nWith some states now legally allowing the use of marijuana, Christians will have to ask themselves some questions in this regard: 1) If something is permissible, is it beneficial? (1 Corinthians 10:23.) 2) Is an activity beneficial for me\u2014and others? The 1 Corinthians 10:23 passage occurs in the context of exercising our Christian freedom with a concern for how our actions might impact others\u2014especially emboldening them to act against their conscience, and so to sin against their conscience. 3) Would the \u201crecreational\u201d use of marijuana lead a person to dull his/her senses and lose self-control? (Proverbs 31:4-5; Luke 21:34; Romans 13:13; Galatians 5:21; Ephesians 5:18) 4) Would a \u201crecreational\u201d use of marijuana lead to addiction? The earlier usage of \u201ceverything is permissible for me\u201d in 1 Corinthians occurs in chapter 6. There (verse 12) Paul explains that we do not want to \u201cbe mastered by anything.\u201d 5) Might we be guilty of sin by acting in doubt? (Romans 14:23) 6) Will I be harming the body that God created, and which belongs to him? (This is a 5th commandment issue.)\nNo doubt, other questions may need to be addressed, but these are ones that come to mind at this time. Addressing questions like these can be helpful for Christians to understand how they can grow in pleasing, not themselves, but God (2 Corinthians 5:9; 1 Thessalonians 4:1)."}

If someone has upset you with unkind or unfair words, you want to speak the truth in love to that person (Ephesians 4:15). If someone has sinned against you, rebuke is in order (Matthew 18:15; Luke 17:3).\nWhen it comes to the actions of other people, the Bible instructs us not to judge hearts or motives (Matthew 7:1).\n\u201cThe God of peace be with you all\u201d (Romans 15:33)."}
{"prompt": "Betrothal and engagement", "completion": "I've been studying the history of WELS and other American Lutheran denominations, and I stumbled upon expressions like \"rightful betrothal\" and \"proper engagement\" in relation to marriage. No, our modern-day engagement \u2013 as opposed to biblical or historical betrothal \u2013 clearly does not establish a marriage. Yet, it seems that some have argued that a \"rightful betrothal\" in some sense would be equivalent to marriage. Since these expressions don't seem to be widely used today, I'm wondering:\r\n(1) What exactly do expressions like \"rightful betrothal\" (or sometimes \"rightful engagement\"  or \"proper engagement/betrothal\") mean, and how is it different from a \"regular\" engagement?\r\n(2) Have there been any changes in the history of the WELS or the Synodical Conference in their teaching on these issues?  \n\n\nVery likely, what you were reading about \u201crightful\u201d or \u201cproper\u201d or \u201cvalid\u201d betrothal was referring to the way in which a man and a woman committed themselves to marrying each other. What characterized such a betrothal was that there was no coercion involved: the man and the woman committed themselves to each other willingly. Additionally, there was parental knowledge and consent of the relationship. In that way, there was nothing secret about the marriage plans.\nBecause modern engagement differs from betrothal practices of the past, you will find changes in teaching on the subject.\nA nice source that reviews this subject matter is a Concordia Publishing House product from 1959: Engagement and Marriage: a sociological, historical, and theological investigation of engagement and marriage.\nOn a related note, the December 2018 \u201cLight for our path\u201d column in Forward in Christ will feature a question about biblical betrothal."}

What does it stand for?\n\n\nNumbers in Revelation are symbolic. 10, and its multiples like 1,000, represent completeness or fullness. 12 symbolizes the church (twelve tribes of Israel, twelve apostles). The product of multiplying these numbers is 144,000. That number represents the entire church of God in Old and New Testament times.\nWe come across the 144,000 first in Revelation 7:4, where God sealed his believers on earth. Then, we see the 144,000 again in Revelation 14:1. This time they are in heaven. Their presence in heaven illustrates what Jesus said in John 10:27-29 \u2013 \u201cMy sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand.

{"prompt": "Eucharistic adoration", "completion": "Could you clarify the Lutheran view of eucharistic adoration?  My understanding is that because Luther acknowledged the scriptural teaching of the Real Presence of Christ, he also supported the adoration of the body and blood of Christ during the worship service, and modern day Lutherans continue to hold this view.  However, I am less clear on why modern Lutherans do not practice eucharistic adoration as a devotion or aid to prayer (unless I am mistaken and it is actually a practice).\r\nIf Lutherans believe the body and blood of Christ are present in the bread and wine, and Scripture does not forbid us from having consecrated bread remaining exposed to the congregation in a reverent way outside the normal worship time, why not have it visible in the church for, say, an hour before or after a service, or on some other occasion, to give church members a visible reminder of Christ's sacrifice and an opportunity to pray in church in front of the real presence of Christ outside normal worship times?  Some people may not find it beneficial, but I suspect others may find it useful in helping them focus their thoughts on Christ and his saving work in a specific, reverent, and prayerful setting.  I understand that is not necessarily the primary purpose of the Lord's Supper, and therefore seen as extraneous, but thinking of 1 Corinthians 11 and the Gospel accounts of the Last Supper, eucharistic adoration is also not forbidden.  Thank you for your explanation.  \r\n\n\n\nMartin Luther acknowledged that any adoration of the sacrament lies in the area of Christian freedom. \u201cWe say that one should not condemn people or accuse them of heresy if they do not adore the Sacrament, for there is no command to that effect and it is not for that purpose that Christ is present. Just as we read that the apostles did not adore the Sacrament since they were sitting and eating at the table. On the other hand, one should not condemn and accuse of heresy people who do adore the Sacrament. For although Christ has not commanded it, neither has he forbidden it, but often accepted it [that is, he accepted it when people bowed to him]. Free, free it must be, according as one is disposed in his heart and has opportunity\u201d (Luther\u2019s Works 36, p. 295).\nHaving the earthly elements of the Lord\u2019s Supper on display for worshipers would not provide them with \u201can opportunity to pray in church in front of the real presence of Christ outside normal worship times.\u201d Lutherans do not teach that the body or blood of Christ is present in the bread and wine apart from the sacramental use (i.e., eating and drinking). \u201cFor nothing can be a sacrament without God\u2019s command and the appointed use for which it is instituted in God\u2019s Word.\u201d (The Formula of Concord. Thorough Declaration. VII. Of the Holy Supper, 108) With the symbol of the cross in mind, Christians can \u201cfocus their thoughts on Christ and his saving work in a specific, reverent, and prayerful setting.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Lying and sin", "completion": "Is lying always sinful?\n\n\nThe Bible does contain narratives of people\u2019s actions without commenting on the appropriateness or sinfulness of their actions. Below are a couple of examples.\nIn Exodus 1:17-19, the king of Egypt issued a decree of killing baby boys that directly opposed God\u2019s moral law that forbids murder. The Egyptian midwives disobeyed Pharaoh\u2019s command and were not honest with him. Christians know that if they encounter conflicting commands from people and God, they have every reason to side with God (Acts 5:29).\nOn the basis of Joshua 2, children of God may sometimes wrestle with the possibility that their truthful statements will be used for harmful and ungodly purposes. While not necessarily commenting on Rahab\u2019s particular course of action in Joshua 2:4, the inspired writer to the Hebrews provides this description of her interaction with the spies: \u201cBy faith the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient\u201d (Hebrews 11:31).\nWhile Scripture alone is the source of our faith, explanations of our faith by fellow Christians can be helpful. So, in that way and within the context of your question, Martin Luther understood lying as withholding the truth from people who are entitled to it. We have to ask: were the kings of Egypt and Jericho entitled to the truth, since they were going to use the truth to oppose God\u2019s will and plans? Christians might answer that question in different ways, but one of those answers is \u201cno.\u201d\nIn regard to Rahab\u2019s actions, the People\u2019s Bible Commentary for the book of Joshua lists (pages 35-36) some helpful truths to keep in mind about her:\n1) Her purpose and motive were in line with God\u2019s revealed will.\n2) All forms of deception are not necessarily immoral. (Cf. Exodus 1:17-19; 2:1-10)\n3) The New Testament commends her faith and refers to her actions as fruits of faith. (Hebrews 11:31; James 2:25)\n4) She was new to the faith and needed to determine a godly course of action quickly.\n5) The cultural practices of her day meant looking out for guests.\n6) We could always do something better with the benefit of hindsight.

{"prompt": "Coffee and wine", "completion": "Is it okay to drink coffee? A Mormon is telling me that it is a grave sin to drink coffee.  Is wine a gift from God?  Psalm 104:15 seems to suggest that it is.\n\n\nThere are no New Testament ceremonial laws. The Bible speaks of our Christian freedom in these areas: \u201cTherefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day\u201d (Colossians 2:16). It is not a sin to drink coffee. The apostle Paul made it clear what God\u2019s kingdom is all about: \u201cFor the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit\u2026\u201d (Romans 14:17)\nPsalm 104:15 does speak of wine as one of God\u2019s gifts. It is the abuse of that gift (or any other gift, for that matter) that constitutes sin."}
{"prompt": "Advent candles traditions", "completion": "What is the right way to light the Advent candles?\n\n\nSince the Bible is silent on a matter like this, \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d becomes very subjective. What I can point you to are long-standing customs and traditions that have developed over the years. What you will notice is that there is variety among those customs.\nThe first candle is known as the prophecy candle or hope candle or expectation candle. The second candle is called the Bethlehem candle or the peace candle or the preparation candle. The third candle has acquired the titles of the shepherds\u2019 candle or the joy candle. The fourth candle has become known as the angel candle or the love candle.\nThree of the four candles are usually blue or purple, and one is pink or rose. Traditionally, since the pink/rose candle is lit on the third Sunday of Advent, the blue/purple candle opposite it is lit on the first Sunday of Advent.\nUse of a white Christ candle in the center of the wreath varies by local custom.\nWith all this variety available, it is helpful for churches to offer to worshipers an explanation of their particular usage of an Advent wreath and candles."}
{"prompt": "Giving comfort to survivors", "completion": "My friend is a recent WELS convert from Judaism.  She is very concerned about her mother who passed as a Jew.  What comfort can I give her regarding judgement day and her loved ones?\n\n\nThe truth of Scripture is that \u201cWhoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned\u201d (Mark 16:16). \u201cBelieving\u201d and \u201cnot believing\u201d in that passage center around Jesus Christ, who said, \u201cI am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me\u201d (John 14:6). Scripture says about Jesus, \u201cSalvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved\u201d (Acts 4:12).\nIf we are convinced that someone has died in unbelief, the only comfort we can give is that which concerns the Christian survivors. We can remind Christians whose lives have been affected by the death of loved ones that Jesus promised: \u201cAnd surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age\u201d (Matthew 28:20). We can remind Christians mourning the death of family members of God\u2019s promise to them: \u201cNever will I leave you; never will I forsake you\u201d (Hebrews 13:5). We can remind Christians whose lives have been shaken by the death of loved ones that God is their \u201crefuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble\u201d (Psalm 46:1).\nDeath is a reminder of the wages of sin (Romans 6:23). One of the petitions in a prayer that was often offered in churches upon the announcement of a member\u2019s death was this: \u201cTeach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom\u201d (Psalm 90:12). Whenever a death takes place, there is a call for the survivors to use their time of grace wisely (2 Corinthians 6:2). True wisdom is knowing Jesus Christ in faith as Lord and Savior (Psalm 111:10; Colossians 2:3).\nGod bless the conversations you have with your friend, as you direct her to the truths and promises of God\u2019s word."}
{"prompt": "Implanted RFID chips", "completion": "Is the RFID chip I'm hearing about people getting in their hand the mark of the beast?\n\n\nNo. The \u201cmark\u201d or seal in Revelation 13:16 is a symbolic way of denoting ownership: those people belong to the beast.\nBy way of contrast, consider how Revelation 7:4 describes God putting a seal or mark on his people. That symbolic sealing identified them as belonging to God.\nThose verses illustrate the truth of Jesus\u2019 words: \u201cWhoever is not with me is against me\u201d (Matthew 12:30). There is no middle ground when it comes to Jesus Christ."}
{"prompt": "God's second commandment", "completion": "What does it mean to use God's name in vain, and can you give an example? Thank you.\n\n\nGod\u2019s second commandment forbids \u201ctaking his name in vain\u201d or \u201cmisusing his name.\u201d Bible translations use both those phrases. \u201cMisusing God\u2019s name\u201d might be easier for us to understand the intent of the commandment.\nIn the Bible, God has revealed his name for good purposes: that we might know him in faith, pray to him and share him with others. What God does not want us to do with his name is use it needlessly, without purpose, or wrongly.\nSo, a wrong use of God\u2019s name is uttering it as an interjection when we are surprised or upset about something: \u201cOh, my God!\u201d That is a common needless use of God\u2019s name. Martin Luther\u2019s explanation of the second commandment in his Catechism informs us that other misuses of God\u2019s name involve cursing, swearing, lying, deceiving and witchcraft.\nLuther reminds us from Scripture that God gave us his name to \u201ccall upon [it] in every trouble, pray, praise, and give thanks.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Transferring membership", "completion": "What is the significance of transferring my membership? I was baptized and confirmed WELS and have always attended a WELS church. I just move for my job quite a bit and have always left my membership at the church my parents still attend to this day.  The WELS church I have been going to is trying to get me to transfer to their WELS church, but I don't see what the big deal is. \n\n\nOne of the blessings of a synod is that members can worship and commune in other churches of its fellowship. It sounds like you have been and are enjoying that blessing.\nBelonging to an individual congregation affords \u201call the rights and privileges\u201d of membership, as you sometimes hear during the rite of Confirmation. Membership in a specific congregation presupposes that people will be utilizing those rights and privileges by primarily worshiping and communing in that congregation.\nIn addition, when people join a specific congregation, they place themselves under the governance of that church and the spiritual oversight of the pastor. It can be challenging for a pastor to provide direct spiritual oversight, which also includes the possibility of church discipline, if people are not able to utilize their membership because of distance.\nFor these reasons like these, pastors will often encourage members to align their church membership with their current location."}
{"prompt": "Welcome at baptism", "completion": "My newborn granddaughter will be being baptized soon in a WELS church.  The baby's father is WELS, but the rest of his family (parents and siblings) are Disciples of Christ.  Will his family be welcome at the baptism?  They are leery of coming, for fear of being ostracized.\n\n\nThey would most certainly be welcome! All are welcome to attend our worship services.\nWhile our closed communion practice addresses the matter of who can receive the sacrament, all people are welcome to hear the proclamation of God\u2019s word by their attendance in our worship services.\nCongratulations to your family on the gift of life and new life from God."}
{"prompt": "New Testament freedom", "completion": "Can Christians eat blood? I know the Old Testament ceremonial laws no longer need to be followed because Jesus came and fulfilled the law, and several places in the New Testament confirm that. But Acts 15:29 says we should abstain from eating blood. Given the context, this sounds like a command still applicable to post-resurrection Christians. But it doesn't seem to fit Christian freedom. Is it wrong to eat blood? (For example, coagulated blood is in some Chinese cuisine.) If so, why? Why does that apply when other rules about what we can eat were abolished? \n\n\nThe Jerusalem Council (Acts 15) addressed the question of whether or not Gentile converts needed to observe any Old Testament ceremonial laws to become members of the Christian Church. The Council affirmed that faith in Jesus Christ alone saves.\nAt the same time the Council directed Gentile converts to abstain from items (\u201cfrom blood\u201d \u2013 Acts 15:29) that would have been offensive to Jewish Christians who were transitioning from Old Testament obligations to New Testament freedoms.\nIt is clear from the immediate context of Acts 15 that the directive had limited application and is not binding on all Christians of all time. The wider context of Scripture\u2014sections like Romans 14, 1 Corinthians 8 and Colossians 2\u2014speaks of the freedom Christians enjoy when it comes to diet.\nThe Bible makes it clear that there are no New Testament ceremonial laws."}
{"prompt": "Judgment of the living and the dead", "completion": "In the Nicene Creed what does \"He will come again to judge the living and the dead\" refer to? Since we are judged at the moment of death, I take this to mean: when Jesus returns, those that are still alive in a worldly sense will be judged on that day. The living and the dead is referring to the souls of those people. The living is one that is living in faith as a Christian, and the dead is one that is dead to sin. \n\n\nIn all three ecumenical creeds (Apostles\u2019, Nicene and Athanasian) Christians confess what Scripture teaches: \u201c\u2026Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead\u2026\u201d (2 Timothy 4:1).\nAs you noted, when people die, judgment takes place (Hebrews 9:27). When Jesus returns visibly on the Last Day, he will make public what those judgments at death were, and he will pronounce judgment on those who are alive on the earth on that day (Matthew 25:31-46).\nWith reference to whether people died before Jesus\u2019 visible return on the Last Day or if they are alive on that day, Jesus will \u201cjudge the living and the dead.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Wine and grape juice", "completion": "Did Jesus actually drink wine?  I have heard many say that Jesus drank grape juice, because the Greek word for wine can mean grape juice.\n\n\nThe Greek word for wine that the inspired Bible writers used means \u201cwine, fermented grape juice.\u201d There is a Greek word for unfermented grape juice, but the Bible writers did not use that word.\nThere is nothing sinful in the moderate use of alcoholic beverages such as wine. Jesus\u2019 use of wine in his celebration of the Passover with his disciples\u2014and the institution of the Lord\u2019s Supper\u2014illustrates that.\nThe phrase that the Gospel writers use in their accounts of the institution of the Lord\u2019s Supper (\u201cfruit of the vine,\u201d Matthew 26:29; Mark 14:25; Luke 22:18) refers to wine. We know from history that the Passover celebration included wine.

If my family has to leave the US for a year for work reasons, and the European country (British Isles) we go to does not have WELS, ELS, or CELC churches, is there still a chance that there might be a church/gathering we can go to that's in fellowship, or are those the only ones in fellowship? I know we'll be able to watch our home church's livestreaming, but we hoped to still be able to meet with other Christians, especially for Communion.\n\n\nThere is a WELS European civilian chaplain who serves military personnel and civilians in Germany, Italy, England and Switzerland.\nThis link will take you to the appropriate section of WELS\u2019 website, where you can obtain further information.

{"prompt": "Conscience and actions", "completion": "I was a WELS member while I attended different churches, prayed with people of many different denominations, took Communion at other churches, traveled throughout the United States as a speaker for Christian conferences, schools, and church events of different denominations. While I did struggle with guilt and shame for participating in those things at first, I continued to pray and ask God for wisdom and guidance.  How is it possible that I felt so shameful and guilty while simply sharing the truth of the Gospel that I learned as a member of the WELS....and as I prayed and sought God in his Word I found that I was doing what was natural to me as a Christian man...to go and tell all the world. In my experience, I find how the WELS interacts with other denominations by not interacting with other denominations bogus and not beneficial to kingdom building here on earth. \n\n\nI imagine you could have been feeling shame and guilt because you recognized you were going against biblical principles. Our consciences are designed to react to our actions (Romans 2:15).\nIt is commendable that you want \u201cto go and tell the world\u201d about Jesus. At the same time, you want to do God says in his word. What God says is that Christians are not to practice church fellowship with people whose teachings are contrary to his word (Romans 16:17-18).\nNo one benefits and God is not glorified if people gloss over doctrinal differences and pretend there is outward unity when there is not. On the other hand, there is benefit for people and God is glorified when the truths of his word are upheld. I wish you well."}
{"prompt": "Supporting other churches", "completion": "What is WELS' stand on donating to the red kettle Christmas for salvation? Is it OK for a WELS  school to ask Salvation Army (SA) for names of families that we can provide for through school children's gifts? What if some of our school children already have received gifts from SA unbeknownst to our leaders, but those families never ask for help from our church.\n\n\nYour question is one that people can ask at this time of the year. Here is part of a response to a similar question.\nThe charitable work of the Salvation Army is linked with the mission of that church, which is driven by their false doctrine. That is important to keep in mind. The work they do is in line with the mission of their church.\nThe Salvation Army is a self-described \u201choliness movement,\u201d placing greater emphasis on the Christian\u2019s life than on what God has done for people through Jesus Christ his Son. The Salvation Army rejects the sacraments of baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper.\n2 John 10-11 (\u201cIf anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take them into your house or welcome them. Anyone who welcomes them shares in their wicked work.\u201d) instructs us not to support those whose teachings are contrary to Scripture. That applies to the church in your question. That applies to any church that holds to false doctrine. While we can appreciate the tenacity of the bell ringers of that church at Christmas time, we recognize that providing financial support is support for their mission. We refrain from providing that support.\nThere is no need to feel like a Scrooge by walking past the bell ringers. We can help meet the material needs of others (Isaiah 58:7; Galatians 6:10) through contributions to charitable agencies that are not tied to churches that hold to and teach false doctrine. We can give to our church body\u2019s Christian Aid and Relief, for example.\nIn gratitude for God\u2019s blessings and in compassionate concern for the material and spiritual needs of others, Christians have reason for charitable giving at Christmas time and every season of the year. Yes, \u201cLet us all be cheerful givers To the glory of your name\u201d (Christian Worship 577:3).\nYou would do well to encourage your church leadership to address your final questions."}
{"prompt": "Suffering for the faith", "completion": "What does it mean to share in the sufferings of  Christ? Paul and Silas in prison \"counted worthy\"?\r\nCan you recommend a book?\n\n\nTo share in the sufferings of Christ is to experience difficulties and troubles in this life because of a connection to Jesus Christ in faith (Romans 8:17). You can think of these sufferings as \u201ccrosses\u201d (Luke 9:23).\nAfter the apostles received a flogging at the hands of the Sanhedrin and were released, they rejoiced \u201cbecause they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name\u201d (Acts 5:41). That reaction on the part of the apostles illustrates the reaction Christians can have when they suffer for their faith. By nature, we are not worthy of receiving any blessings from God. In his grace, God provides one blessing after another\u2014even the honor of suffering in his name.\nBeyond books of the Bible like Acts and 2 Corinthians, you might benefit from reading The Theology of the Cross. It is available from Northwestern Publishing House."}
{"prompt": "Satan and the evil angels", "completion": "Where/does the Bible say the name of the place where Lucifer landed when he was cast out of paradise?\n\n\nYour reference to Lucifer might have Isaiah 14:12-15 in mind. 2 Peter 2:4 and Jude 6 speak of God casting the devil and the other evil angels into hell.\nIn his wisdom, God permits the devil and his forces to roam the earth (Job 1:7; 1 Peter 5:8). The time is coming when the devil and his angels will be confined to hell forever (Revelation 20:10)."}

We are both in our early 20's and both away at college.  She wants to be more 'Christian' instead of 'Lutheran.' I know that I need to witness to her more than I do, but I struggle to find a way to talk to her about it, because I know that we have different thoughts and beliefs on certain topics.  I don't want to turn her off even more from church and the Bible.

{"prompt": "Sin and repentance", "completion": "I have been searching through Martin Luther's writings concerning the possibility of losing one's salvation. I am having a hard time finding anything that says that one can lose the salvation bought by Christ. I am certainly not speaking of the Calvinistic idea that once God has given the free gift of salvation through His grace and mercy, one is free to do as one pleases and sin may abound without consequence. I speak of the idea that one may lose salvation by error and sin. How does one then return to a state of grace? Sinful humans sin within the first ten minutes of each new day, so how can one be assured of salvation? I am unable to find this in the writings of Martin Luther that I am familiar with. Please direct me to some materials so I may have confidence in this issue. I have been an LCMS Lutheran for 15 years now and am not finding sufficient answers.\r\nThank you for taking the time for my question.\n\n\nIn volume one of What Luther Says, you can read statements like these in the \u201cApostasy\u201d section:\n\u201cWhen the Gospel begins to assert its influence, everybody wants to become a Christian. All seems well, and everybody is pleased. But when a wind or rainstorm of temptation comes on, people fall away in droves.\u201d\n\u201cStand fast, then, hold on, do not flee, do not draw back. If you have begun to believe, carry it through to the end. There are many who stay with it, shed their blood and boldly stake and risk everything. There are the true disciples, and they remain constant. But ten times greater was the number of those who began to believe with us and whom our doctrine at first pleased, but not ten percent have remained faithful till now.\u201d\n\u201cWhen the devil gets a man into his clutches who has been in our midst and also has the Bible, such an apostate is worse and more harmful than all the heathen, who know not Scripture.\u201d\nThrough impenitence and unbelief, Christians can forfeit the salvation they once enjoyed. On the other hand, Christians do not veer out of faith and come back into it with their daily sins of weakness and their repentance. As Christians, we are living in a state of being forgiven: \u201cTherefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand\u201d (Romans 5:1-2). That passage assures us that we stand in grace, that is, we live our lives as Christians trusting that we are forgiven through Jesus Christ. We are assured of salvation because we have God\u2019s own word on it (John 3:16)."}
{"prompt": "LDS and Christian church", "completion": "Hi, I have a question. My religion is LDS and I am pretty open to accepting and learning new things. A few years ago I went to a Christian church with a friend and it was my first time. When we sat down in the chapel area, I started to get light headed. I did eat before I went there. I got pale too. I walked outside out of church and I got better. I thought maybe it was just the flu coming up. I didn't want to think bad about it, but two months later I went back to that Christian church with a friend again and then same thing happened.  I got light-headed and pale in face. I went back outside and got better. Is this a sign or something behind it? Tonight I went to a Christian church in a different area for the Christmas party and I was fine.  \n\n\nI would not look for signs from God in the everyday events of life. I would encourage you to look to the Bible. That is where God speaks very clearly about sin and the only Savior from sin, Jesus Christ.\nA church that points you to the perfect life, the vicarious death and the glorious resurrection of Jesus Christ is one that can benefit you. A church that directs you to the message of salvation by God\u2019s grace through faith in Jesus Christ alone is one that can be a blessing to you."}

{"prompt": "God's inspired word", "completion": "My uncle is ELCA and I am WELS.  The last time we saw each other, we got on the topic of religion.  He fully believes that Jesus died for his sins and he is very devout to his faith, as he reads the Bible nearly every morning.  But when I asked him if the Bible is without error, he answered that he thinks the Bible has several errors.  He doesn\u2019t believe in Genesis because no one was actually there to record it and parts of the Old Testament.  He also claims that the Bible has gone through multiple translations and changes throughout history, saying that Constantine changed many things in the Bible to draw and force people to Christianity.  Is this true?  I\u2019ll be seeing him over Christmas and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get on this topic again.  How would I answer this argument?  Thanks!\n\n\nIt is good that your uncle reads the Bible faithfully. You could help him out by encouraging him to read Psalm 119. In great detail, the psalm writer explains that \u201cAll your words are true\u201d (Psalm 119:160). Other psalms also speak of God\u2019s word being flawless \u2013 Psalm 12:6; Psalm 18:30. Proverbs 30:5 states the same truth. In John 17:17 Jesus does as well.\nIf God\u2019s word is true, and it is, then everything in it is true. That includes the creation account. Certainly, God alone was present when he called everything into existence, and God alone provides the account of his creation. Christian faith takes God at his word (Hebrews 11:3).\nConstantine did not change anything in the Bible. He reversed the direction that Diocletian took towards Christians and gave their religion legal status.\nGod inspired the writers of his word to write exactly what he wanted (1 Corinthians 2:13; 2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:21). God preserved his word through careful copyists throughout history. The result is that we today have God\u2019s word\u2014a lamp for our feet and a light for our path (Psalm 119:105).\nA valuable Christmas gift for your uncle would be a good book on biblical interpretation or creation. The books are available from Northwestern Publishing House.\nGod bless your conversations with your uncle. Have a blessed Christmas!"}

Thank you.\r\n\n\n\nYou might be thinking of this: \u201c105] But when Dr. Luther or we employ this word spiritual in regard to this matter, we understand by it the spiritual, supernatural, heavenly mode, according to which Christ is present in the Holy Supper, working not only consolation and life in the believing, but also condemnation in the unbelieving; whereby we reject the Capernaitic thoughts of the gross [and] carnal presence which is ascribed to and forced upon our churches by the Sacramentarians against our manifold public protestations. In this sense we also say [wish the word spiritually to be understood when we say] that in the Holy Supper the body and blood of Christ are spiritually received, eaten, and drunk, although this participation occurs with the mouth, while the mode is spiritual.\n\u201c106] Thus our faith in this article concerning the true presence of the body and blood of Christ in the Holy Supper is based upon the truth and omnipotence of the true, almighty God, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. These foundations are strong and firm enough to strengthen and establish our faith in all temptations concerning this article, and, on the contrary, to overthrow and refute all the counter-arguments and objections of the Sacramentarians, however agreeable and plausible they may be to our reason; and upon them a Christian heart also can securely and firmly rest and rely.\u201d [Concordia Triglotta.

{"prompt": "Immaculate conception", "completion": "What is immaculate conception, and what is the WELS' view on it?\n\n\n\u201cImmaculate conception\u201d refers to the false teaching of the Roman Catholic Church that Mary was conceived and born without sin.\nWe reject that teaching because it is not biblical. Scripture teaches that, since the fall into sin, people are conceived and born in sin (Psalm 51:5; John 3:5-6; Ephesians 2:1). Mary herself acknowledged her need for a Savior from sin (Luke 1:46-47).\nThe work of the Holy Spirit in the virgin Mary made it possible for the sinless Son of God to enter the world as a human being without a sinful nature (Luke 1:30-35; 2 Corinthians 5:21; Hebrews 7:26-27). In addition to being conceived and born without a sinful nature, Jesus lived a completely holy life in our place (John 8:46; Hebrews 4:15; 1 Peter 2:22)."}
{"prompt": "The mark of the beast", "completion": "I have read numerous commentaries, confessional Lutheran resources, study Bibles etc. and I can't find an answer on what the mark and number of the beast mentioned in Revelation is referring to.  Many today claim it could be a microchip put in the hand or forehead. I am not tempted to think our doctrine is wrong but on this point with what we're seeing today the mark of the beast and the mircrochip seem like a frightening coincidence. Could you please explain to me what we as WELS Lutherans teach about the mark of the beast? And please don't forget to address what Scripture means when it says you can't buy or sell without taking this mark? Many WELS resources don't touch on that point much (having the mark to buy or sell).  Thank you.  \n\n\nThe \u201cmark\u201d in Revelation 13:16 is a symbolic way of denoting ownership: those people belong to the beast. By way of contrast, consider how Revelation 7:4 describes God putting a seal on his people. That symbolic sealing identified them as belonging to God.\nThose verses illustrate the truth of Jesus\u2019 words: \u201cWhoever is not with me is against me\u201d (Matthew 12:30). There is no middle ground when it comes to Jesus Christ.\nRegarding Revelation 13:17 (\u2026\u201dso that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name.\u201d), Dr. Siegbert Becker offered this explanation in Revelation: The Distant Triumph Song: \u201cThis mark gives them the right to engage in commerce and to participate in the economic activity of the community. The sort of thing spoken of here is illustrated in many communist countries, where one must openly demonstrate allegiance to the atheistic form of government in order to participate fully in the business world as well as in the world of politics. In many of those countries, for example, young people are denied a higher education and entrance into the professions unless they join organizations for communist youth. Thus, in a sense, they cannot \u2018buy or sell\u2019 unless they have \u2018the mark, the name of the beast of the number of his name.\u2019\u201d (pages 211-212)\nThe book is available from Northwestern Publishing House."}
{"prompt": "Flat earth response", "completion": "How do you answer someone who believes that the earth is flat?\n\n\nI imagine you could best respond by asking the person the reasons for holding to that position. The Bible does not support that view.\nIt could be that people imagine the world to be flat from reading passages like Isaiah 11:12 (\u201cHe will raise a banner for the nations and gather the exiles of Israel; he will assemble the scattered people of Judah from the four quarters of the earth.) and Revelation 7:1 (After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth to prevent any wind from blowing on the land or on the sea or on any tree.).\nIn his word, however, God often uses language to come down to our level so that we can understand him and his ways better. The \u201cfour quarters\u201d and \u201cfour winds\u201d match up with the four directions (Luke 13:29). In the Bible God even used the terminology of people\u2019s understanding of his creation (cf. Joshua and the sun standing still, Joshua 10:1-15).\nYou may find helpful resources from Lutheran Science Institute to formulate your answer."}
{"prompt": "Knowing God personally", "completion": "I am preparing for a personal, spiritual conversation and want to answer this question with full biblical backing:  \"Can I know God personally?\"\n\n\nIt seems that the word \u201cpersonally\u201d might be an important word in your question. That word is defined as \u201cin person; as a person; for oneself; and, in a personal manner.\u201d Let\u2019s see how those definitions might shape the answer to your question.\nCan people meet God \u201cin person\u201d? One of our Communion hymns states: \u201cHere, O my Lord, I see you face to face\u201d (Christian Worship 315:1). Through word and sacrament, God comes to people. In the Sacrament of Holy Communion, Jesus\u2019 body and blood are present in, with and under the bread and wine (Luke 22:19-20). In the pages of Holy Scripture, God himself speaks to readers and listeners (2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:21).\nCan people meet God \u201cas a person\u201d? Certainly. God is not an impersonal cosmic force. In the Bible reveals himself as Father, Son and Holy Spirit (Matthew 3:16-17; 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14). In the Bible God reveals his names and attributes so we can know him in faith.\nCan a person meet God \u201cfor oneself\u201d? Yes. Jesus said, \u201cCome to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest\u201d (Matthew 11:28). The Lord promised, \u201cAnyone who loves me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them\u201d (John 14:23). Jesus\u2019 love is for every person in the world (John 3:16).\nFinally, can people meet God \u201cin a personal manner\u201d? By all means. God does not speak in abstract terms in the Bible. He tells you that your sins are forgiven (Luke 22:20). He promises to hear and answer your prayers (Psalm 50:15). He gives you peace (John 14:27). He promises to be with you always (Matthew 28:20).\nWhen it comes to knowing the God of the Bible, there is of course a great difference between knowledge and saving faith. There can be no faith without knowledge (Romans 10:14), but knowledge of God alone will not save anyone (James 2:19). Saving faith is trust in God and reliance on him for the forgiveness of sins and eternal life (Isaiah 25:9).\nI hope these thoughts will be helpful for you. God bless your conversation!"}
{"prompt": "Early childhood ministries", "completion": "I would like to understand if/how many ELC programs that the Synod provided seed money to get started/determine need/etc.\n\n\nWhile the Commission on Lutheran Schools provides resources for congregations exploring early childhood ministries, it does not have funding for congregational startups. Some congregations have sought seed money through grants that they pursued on their own."}
{"prompt": "Origin and meaning of \"Easter\"", "completion": "I have a question about the origination of the word Easter. My husband is a former WELS member who says he cannot attend any church that uses the word Easter to refer to our Lord's resurrection due to the origin of the word being Ishtar, who was a Babylonian fertility goddess. He also says that man's tradition of Easter eggs and the Easter bunny refer to ancient pagan fertility rites and that Christians should never take part in this. I have tried to research this topic online and have come across explanations that both support and refute this viewpoint, but either way I am very sad that my husband does not want to attend my WELS church with me (I attend and participate regularly by myself) and I would like to know the church's view on this subject. Thanks!\n\n\nIt is difficult to determine the origin of the word \u201cEaster.\u201d Some people have tried to identify it with the name of the Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring \u201cEostre.\u201d Others see the word coming from the German \u201cOstern,\u201d which means \u201cEast.\u201d \u201cEast\u201d points our eyes to the direction of the sun\u2019s rising. \u201cRising\u201d is certainly what Easter Sunday is all about: it is all about the physical resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.\nIt is unfortunate that your husband places so much emphasis on the word \u201cEaster.\u201d Regardless of the etymology of the word, Easter Sunday points to the empty tomb of Jesus Christ. And the empty tomb means that God accepted Jesus\u2019 holy life and innocent death as the full payment of the world\u2019s sins (Romans 4:25).\nChristian churches that use the word \u201cEaster\u201d do not sanction pagan deities any more than people who use the days of the week and the months of the year in their vocabulary. It is very clear that the days of the week and several months have their origin in pagan deities and mythologies. Yet, Christians can use those names because they recognize that they are not endorsing the original meaning behind them.\nCertainly, we want to avoid human traditions that obscure or deny Christian truths. Traditions that lie in the area of Christian freedom are available for Christians to follow or ignore. Scripture instructs Christians to be careful in their exercise of Christian freedom and their judgments of others (Romans 14; 1 Corinthians 8).\nPerhaps your husband will feel better if he looks at the Christian church year calendar in Christian Worship: A Lutheran Hymnal. On page 158 Easter Sunday is called \u201cThe Resurrection of our Lord.\u201d Christian Worship: Manual uses the same terminology on pages 412 and 413. Using \u201cEaster\u201d and \u201cThe Resurrection of our Lord\u201d interchangeably is common in Christian churches.\n\u201cEaster\u201d or \u201cThe Resurrection of our Lord\u201d? With either term, the emphasis is on the Son of God who said, \u201cI am the Living One; I was dead, and now look, I am alive for ever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades\u201d (Revelation 1:18). I pray that your husband is able to keep Easter terminology in perspective and that you can both worship together."}
{"prompt": "Rebuke in a marriage", "completion": "The Bible teaches us what the role is of a husband and a wife in a marriage. Wives must submit to their husband as they are the head. What role does the husband and wife play when it comes to disciplining your spouse for something they did wrong? I know a husband and wife are equal in the sense they are adult human beings but what does God say about the wife disciplining the husband and/or the husband disciplining the wife when he or she does something wrong?\n\n\nBiblical instructions regarding rebuke are applicable to husbands and wives. \u201cIf your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault, just between the two of you. If they listen to you, you have won them over\u201d (Matthew 18:15). \u201cIf your brother or sister sins against you, rebuke them; and if they repent, forgive them\u201d (Luke 17:3).\nIt is certainly fitting that in a home where a husband and a wife exercise their Christian faith, confession and absolution take place. Because the marriage relationship is built on selflessness, it would seem that any resulting \u201cdiscipline\u201d would be mutually agreed upon."}
{"prompt": "Science and the earth", "completion": "How do we know earth is a sphere? The information we\u2019ve been taught is from scientists who also teach evolution.  The pictures we see are from NASA who are also scientists. How do we know those pictures are real or made up in Hollywood? The Bible says that God moved the sun backwards. That sounds like the sun revolves around the earth. It also talks about a firmament or dome.  \n\n\nIt would not be accurate to conclude that all scientists teach evolution and deny the Bible\u2019s creation account. There are scientists past (including some in the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century) and present who recognize(d) God as the Creator of all.\nA very recent question and answer addressed the subject matter of your question. You will find that information here."}
{"prompt": "Flood of Noah's day", "completion": "How far back was the Noah and the Ark incident?\n\n\nYours is a concise but challenging question. Because the genealogies in the Old Testament were not intended to be complete, it is difficult to arrive at accurate dates for some of the oldest events. A common thought is that the Flood of Noah\u2019s day could have taken place some 1,700 years after creation. That is only an approximation by some people.\nYou might be interested to read \u201cOld Testament Chronology.\u201d It is a short paper from the Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary Essay File."}
{"prompt": "Deacon and vicar", "completion": "What are the differences between a called deacon and a called vicar in the WELS?  Can both preach, serve Communion, be a lector, etc.?  What limitations does each position hold?\n\n\nBy \u201cdeacon\u201d I understand that you are referring to a male staff minister. Calling bodies can give staff ministers titles like \u201cdeacon\u201d as they determine the areas of responsibility in the person\u2019s public ministry.\nWith that understanding and the activities listed in mind, a male staff minister is able to assist with the distribution of the Lord\u2019s Supper and serve as a lector. While the male staff minister receives training in administration, youth and family, member care, outreach and assimilation, and education within the congregation, he does not receive training in preaching. While his training enables him to lead devotions, he is not prepared for regular preaching. Ordinarily, a vicar has received two years of seminary training in crafting and delivering sermons, so he will be preaching during his vicar year.\nAs far as limitations are concerned, a vicar is still a student of the seminary. Together with the congregation to which he is assigned, his supervising pastor will determine the scope of his activities. On the other hand, a male staff minister serves in a part-time or full-time position, carrying out responsibilities outlined in his call.\nI hope this helps explain the differences between the two positions."}
{"prompt": "Heresy", "completion": "Hi, good day. I would like to know what is a heresy. Thanks.\n\n\n\u201cHeresy\u201d is false doctrine. It is a belief or teaching that is not biblical. An example would be saying that people save themselves by the things they do in life. The Bible teaches that people enjoy God\u2019s free gift of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ alone (Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:5-6).\nBecause heresies are so serious, the prayer of the hymn writer is very much in place: \u201cO gracious Lord, direct us, Your doctrine pure defend, From heresies protect us, And for your Word contend, That we may praise you ever, O God, with one accord And say: The Lord our Savior Be evermore adored!\u201d (Christian Worship 585:3)"}
{"prompt": "Old Testament Sabbath day", "completion": "If the Sabbath was instituted in the Garden of Eden, and precedes the Mosaic Law, why don't modern Christians observe the Sabbath? I get why we would be freed from the Mosaic ordinances of the Sabbath, but why don't we consider the day especially sanctified (more so than a Sunday or Monday) if the Sabbath precedes the Mosaic Law?\n\n\nWhile Genesis 2:2-3 speaks of God resting on the seventh day after creating all things, that section of the Bible does not contain an instruction for any people to imitate God\u2019s actions. The command for the people of Israel to observe the Sabbath day took place during the days of Moses (Exodus 20:8-11).\nThe context of the command does contain a reference to God resting from his work of creation, but it is a reference only. The command to observe the Sabbath day came about in Moses\u2019 day.\nAs the command to observe the Sabbath day was part of the Old Testament ceremonial law, it is no longer binding on New Testament followers of the Lord (Colossians 2:16). God still desires that we gather together to worship him (Hebrews 10:25), but he has not specified a particular day of the week."}
{"prompt": "People and angels", "completion": "Are people higher than the angels? I have always  believed and been told that this is true as we are God's children and they are God's servants or messengers. My pastor disagreed, quoting psalms 8:5. I discussed this with my ELS family, including my sister, a former Christian day school teacher married to an ELS minister and she too believed we are higher than the angels. I have read 1 Corinthians 6:3 and other NT references and now I am confused.\n\n\nYou will want to define what you mean by \u201chigher\u201d or (\u201clower\u201d). Are people the crown of God\u2019s creation (Genesis 1:26-2:3), the objects of God\u2019s redeeming love in Christ (Hebrews 2:10-18; 1 Peter 1:12), the beneficiaries of angels\u2019 service (Hebrews 1:14), and, along with Jesus, future judges of the evil angels (1 Corinthians 6:3; Jude 6)? Yes. Do angels have greater strength and abilities than people on earth (Psalm 91:11-13; 103:20; 2 Thessalonians 1:7)? Yes. Focusing on these differing circumstances will undoubtedly address your definition of \u201chigher\u201d or \u201clower.\u201d\nPsalm 8:4-5 presents challenges to biblical interpreters. The question regarding verse four is the identification of the \u201cman\u201d and \u201cson of man\u201d (in many Bible translations). Does that refer only to people? Does it refer to people and also Jesus when he became man and lived a humble life on earth? Does it refer only to Jesus when he became man and lived a humble life on earth? Additionally, verse five can be translated \u201ca little lower than the heavenly beings,\u201d \u201ca little lower than angels\u201d or \u201ca little lower than God.\u201d\nWhat is clear is that the writer to the Hebrews applied Psalm 8:4-6 to Jesus (Hebrews 2:5-9). When Jesus Christ became a man and lived on earth, he did not always or fully use his powers and abilities as the eternal Son of God. Jesus never ceased being God, but he experienced temptation, suffering and death.\nPsalm 148 puts all this in perspective. God the Creator is to receive praise from the angels he created (verse two) and the people he created (verses eleven and twelve)."}
{"prompt": "Rebuilding trust discussion", "completion": "I am going to a Christian Business Round Table tomorrow morning.  The Topic for discussion is, \"Lessons Learned When Trust is Broken & What it Takes to Rebuild.\"  Attendance will be men of several different denominations.  One gentleman is from India with a Hindu background and, I might add, seemingly a new Christian.   I want to participate in this discussion from a WELS standpoint and am simply seeking a few good talking points whereas I may be able to respond appropriately during the conversation. \r\nThank you in advance. \n\n\nI apologize if this response is too late for you to use at your meeting, but there is a little lag time between submitting questions and providing responses. Perhaps what follows can be of help in the future.\nFrom a Christian perspective, we would say that if trust has been broken by sin, then confession and absolution are in order (James 5:16; Luke 17:3-4). Forgiving those who sin against us and confess their sins to us is not optional; God requires it (Matthew 6:14-15).\nForgiving someone who has sinned against us does not mean that we condone the sin or that the hurt is not real. Forgiving someone who has sinned against us does not automatically mean that trust has been restored. In the case of a husband who has sinned against God and his wife by unfaithfulness, he will need to regain the trust of his wife through his words and behavior. Honesty, integrity, Christian love and Christian living will go a long way in rebuilding trust in human relationships.\nMartin Luther\u2019s explanation to the first commandment is \u201cWe should fear, love, and trust in God above all things.\u201d When we fail to trust God, we violate his will. Accordingly, we confess that sin to him. We have God\u2019s own word that such confession is not meaningless: \u201cIf we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness\u201d (1 John 1:9). And more than forgiving, God does not remember our sins (Jeremiah 31:34). Our forgiving God wants us to trust him (John 14:1).\nI hope thoughts like these can be helpful for you at some point."}

It forbids the abuse of alcoholic beverages (Proverbs 23:20, 31-33; Ephesians 5:18).\nA 21st birthday\u2014or any birthday\u2014is an opportunity to thank God for another year of grace.

{"prompt": "Wine and myrrh", "completion": "Is it okay to drink wine that is mixed with myrrh for flavor? I have heard that it tastes great, though I have heard some say you should not drink it because Jesus denied it when he was on the cross. I have heard others say you can drink it because there are are no dietary guidelines in the New Testament, and the reason Jesus denied it is because it would have taken away his suffering on the cross.\n\n\nThere are no New Testament ceremonial laws. Colossians 2:16 states: \u201cTherefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day.\u201d When it comes to diet, sanctified common sense and the desire to glorify God (1 Corinthians 10:31) guide Christians.\nYour closing thoughts about Jesus on the cross are correct. Previously, I offered this commentary: \u201cMyrrh had the properties of dulling the senses and making a crucifixion victim more cooperative and less likely to put up any resistance as he was being fastened to a cross. When Jesus tasted the potion offered by the soldiers, he rejected it. He refused to reach the culmination of his messianic mission in a stupor; he was going to drink the cup of suffering for the world\u2019s sins fully alert and in command of his senses. That meant he would refuse to drink what was in the soldiers\u2019 cup.\u201d (When Christ Walked Among Us)\nAt some point later, expressed his thirst\u2014fulfilling prophecy (Psalm 22:15)\u2014and then received wine vinegar, without myrrh, to be able to speak loudly and clearly the message the world needed to hear: \u201cIt is finished\u201d (John 19:30)."}

{"prompt": "Custom in Corinth", "completion": "Hello, I am a lifelong male WELS member and I am having difficulty with the prohibition of women's suffrage in WELS. It is my understanding that 1 Corinthians 14 is cited as one of the reasons that women cannot vote in church elections. 1 Corinthians 11:2-16 seems to indicate to me that women should cover their head (or maybe it is interpreted as having long hair). If that is so, why then are women with no head covering or with short hair allowed to participate in worship? Doesn't verse 14 suggest that men with long hair is a sin? \n\n\nIn 1 Corinthians 11, the apostle Paul was speaking of a custom or practice that existed only in the city of Corinth. The practice included women having long hair or wearing head coverings and men having short hair or not covering their heads.\nIn the everyday, pagan culture of Corinth, men and women adorned themselves this way because they recognized the different roles of men and women. They came to that recognition not on the basis of Scripture, which they rejected, but from the natural differences that they observed between men and women.\nThe directive in 1 Corinthians 11 was that the Christian women in Corinth not to be social renegades by disregarding what their heathen counterparts were doing, but be living examples of biblical principles regarding men and women (1 Corinthians 11:3). By mirroring cultural practices that were occasioned by the natural knowledge of God and conscience, the Christian women of Corinth could reinforce that knowledge and display their faith so others could be positively influenced (Matthew 5:16).\nWe keep the observation about men\u2019s hair in verse fourteen in perspective when we look at verse sixteen: \u201cIf anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice\u2014nor do the churches of God.\u201d In the original Greek, \u201cother\u201d is really \u201csuch.\u201d The apostle explains that the hair/head covering situation in Corinth was a local practice and not a universal principle that binds all Christian women of all time. That explanation also includes men and what was said about their long hair.\nIn summary, the answer to your question means recognizing the difference between a local custom (hair/head coverings) and the biblical teaching of head and helper (1 Corinthians 11:3, 8-9). Congregational voting is an application of the biblical teaching of head and helper.\nYou might be interested in \u201cA Bible Study on Man and Woman in God\u2019s World.\u201d Your congregation may have it in its church library. It is also available from Northwestern Publishing House."}
{"prompt": "Knowledge on the Last Day", "completion": "When God raises the bodies of the dead and reunites them with the soul, is the judgment of each individual made public for all to see?  If so, would I then be aware of the damnation of a family member? Assuming I will be in heaven by the grace of God, wouldn't the knowledge of a loved one going to hell affect my happiness in heaven? Thank you so much.\n\n\nWhen people die, they face judgment from God (Hebrews 9:27). As you correctly noted, that personal judgment will be made public on the last day (Matthew 25:31-46).\nHow might Christians react to the realization that a loved one is not among the sheep of Jesus\u2019 fold? We do have to keep some Scripture passages in mind. Revelation 21:4 \u2013 \u201cHe will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.\u201d Psalm 16:11 \u2013 \u201cYou make known to me the path of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand.\u201d\nWithout knowing precisely how your question will play out in the lives of Christians on the Last Day, some have proposed that Christians will have perfect joy in heaven because they will not be aware of a loved one not being with them. Others have suggested that Christians will have that knowledge, but it will not be a source of sorrow for them. While that sounds cold and heartless right now, in heaven our wills will be entirely in line with God\u2019s will (as was the case with Adam and Eve at the beginning of time). Therefore, if God condemns people on the Last Day for their rejection of him, just as he said (Mark 16:16), Christians\u2014whose wills will be entirely in line with God\u2019s will\u2014will recognize and acknowledge that God\u2019s judgments are true and just (Revelation 16:5-7). While our emotions right now might interfere with and object to God\u2019s will, that will not be the case in heaven. In heaven, the words we pray now\u2014\u201cYour will be done\u201d\u2014will be a way of life for us.\nYour question underscores how important it is that we share with our family and friends the good news of Jesus Christ, so that through Spirit-worked faith they can be with us in the perfect joys and glories of God\u2019s presence in heaven."}
{"prompt": "Worship service attendance", "completion": "I enjoy attending church as an opportunity to grow and foster my faith, but sometimes I feel overwhelmed by attending church so frequently.  Is there a standard for how often I should attend worship?\r\n\r\n \n\n\nAs Christians, we recognize that our sinful nature is hostile to God and wants nothing to do with worshiping God (Romans 8:7). As Christians, we also recognize that our new self delights to do what God says, including worshiping him with fellow believers (Psalm 122:1). When it comes to worship opportunities, then, Christians can be torn between two desires. Martin Luther\u2019s explanation of the meaning of Baptism for our daily life describes the desired outcome in the battle between those two natures: \u201cBaptism means that the Old Adam in us should be drowned by daily contrition and repentance, and that all its evil deeds and desires be put to death. It also means that a new person should daily arise to live before God in righteousness and purity forever\u201d (Small Catechism).\nLed by the Holy Spirit and our new self, we love God\u2019s word (Psalm 119) and we love God\u2019s house (Psalm 84:10). We look to gather with fellow believers for mutual encouragement (Hebrews 10:25), to hear our God speak to us through his word (2 Timothy 3:16-17), to receive the Lord\u2019s Supper (Matthew 26:26-28), to offer him our prayers and praises (Psalm 149:1) and to support the work of the Lord\u2019s church (Galatians 6:6).\nGod\u2019s standard for us in everything in life is perfection (1 Peter 1:15-16). Sadly, we fail to meet that standard (Romans 3:23). Thankfully, Jesus met that standard of perfection for us (Hebrews 4:15). In thankful response for God\u2019s forgiveness, we now strive to what God says. We know we can\u2019t be perfect in life, but we try to lead God-pleasing lives as best we can (2 Peter 3:14).\nRather than setting up and trying to meet an arbitrary standard for worship, I would encourage you to seize all the worship opportunities that are available to you. You may want to share with your pastor why you feel overwhelmed with your church\u2019s worship schedule.\nYour question provides an opportunity to be reminded of what the Bible says about worship: \u201cCome, let us bow down in worship, let us kneel before the Lord our Maker\u201d (Psalm 95:6)."}
{"prompt": "Lutheran view of Mary", "completion": "I am a confirmed WELS Lutheran.  However, I was raised Catholic.  One of the most frequent questions I'm asked is how do Lutherans view Mary, the mother of Jesus.  What is the Lutheran teaching regarding Mary?  I have gotten conflicting opinions on this subject and would like clarification.  Thank you!\n\n\nWe view Mary as the woman God graciously chose to give birth to Jesus Christ. Mary received that honor and privilege only because of God\u2019s grace to her (Luke 1:26-38).\nRoman Catholic Church teaching is that Mary entered this world as a baby without a sinful nature. The Bible does not teach that. The Bible teaches that all people born from a human father and a human mother are conceived and born in sin (John 3:6). Like all such people, Mary was in need of a Savior to forgive her sins. She recognized her sinfulness and need for a Savior (Luke 1:47). Roman Catholic Church teaching is that Mary did not commit actual sins. The Bible teaches that all people born from a human father and a human mother are guilty of sin (Psalm 14:2-3; Romans 3:23).\nRoman Catholic Church teaching is that Mary remained a virgin after she gave birth to Jesus by not having sexual relations with Joseph. The Bible does not teach that. Roman Catholic Church teaching is that Mary\u2019s body and soul went to heaven at the end of her earthly life. The Bible does not teach that. Roman Catholic Church teaching is that Mary is in a position to receive and answer prayers that are directed to her. The Bible teaches that any acts of worship, including prayer, are to be directed to God alone (Matthew 4:10; Revelation 22:9). Roman Catholic Church teaching speaks of a \u201csaving office\u201d of Mary. The Bible does not teach that. There is only one Savior and mediator between God and people: Jesus Christ (1 Timothy 2:5-6).\nWhen we stick to what the Bible teaches, we will understand that Mary was a person who received a great blessing from God in being the woman to give birth to the Christ child. From the Bible, we will see that the Savior, Jesus Christ, came to save people from their sins, including Mary.\nI hope this clarification is helpful."}
{"prompt": "God and dreams", "completion": "Does God reveals his plans for our lives by speaking directly to us, such as in a dream?  My daughter's boyfriend, who is also Lutheran, but goes to a non-denominational school, told her he had to break up with her because God spoke to him in his bed (apparently in a dream) and told him they were not meant to be together.   She is brokenhearted and confused by his actions.\n\n\nGod of course can do anything. He can communicate to us any way he chooses. The Bible describes instances when God did speak directly to people, through others and in dreams. The fact that God communicated in these ways in the past does not guarantee that God will do so in the future.\nWhat the Bible does say is that \u201cIn the past God spoke to our forefathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son\u2026\u201d (Hebrews 1:1-2). We have God\u2019s full communication to us in the pages of the Old and New Testament. There is no need to look elsewhere for communication from God. In addition, God tells us that dreams can actually be a tool of people who want to mislead and deceive us (Jeremiah 23:25-28).\nWe have no promise of God that he will communicate to us beyond Scripture. So, we do well to focus on God\u2019s communication to us through the Bible and our communication to him in prayer."}
{"prompt": "\"Sampler\" worship booklet", "completion": "I am an organist at my WELS church.

The booklet contained 21 hymns\u201420 of which are in Christian Worship: A Lutheran Hymnal.\nThe liturgy was a revision of the Common Service\u2014with and without Holy Communion. The revision of that order of service included: \u201ca) A single, new Confession of Sins \u2014 Briefer and with the Kyrie sung between the confession and absolution. b) The traditional Introit is omitted. c) Psalmody is introduced before the scripture readings and functions somewhat as the traditional Introit. It may be spoken responsively or sung. d) Provision is made for an Old Testament reading in non-Communion services. e) A new proper, the Verse, is sung just before the Gospel. This is basically a New Testament verse, often a \u201cgem\u201d of Scripture, relating to the season and the particular Sunday. It is intended to be sung by the choir. If there is no choir, it may be spoken by the pastor and concluded with the familiar triple Alleluia of the congregation. f) When there are three readings, no Gradual or other type of response is provided between the first and second readings. g) Prayer of the Church: A responsive form of our present General Prayer is provided which may be used when desired.\u201d (from the essay Enriching our Worship Heritage)\nPastors like myself who served in parish ministry at the time of the Sampler may have personal copies of the Sampler you could borrow.

{"prompt": "Sickness and God's love", "completion": "Is God causing harm to me with cancer? Someone in church said that to me. I\u2019m confused by it. I know sin causes all kinds of problems. But ultimately I feel God wants the very best for me. He loves me and has forgiven me. Doctors say I don\u2019t have long to live. Am I missing something? I am a believer. I look forward to heaven. Is God causing me harm? \n\n\nBy identifying yourself as a fellow believer in Jesus Christ, I can assure you that God is not looking to harm you by the cancer you are dealing with. God is not punishing you for your sins; he has already punished Jesus in your place (Isaiah 53:4-6; 2 Corinthians 5:21). He has forgiven you your sins, as you confessed.\nWhile people certainly can bring physical sufferings on themselves by abusing substances, Christians can experience sickness and disease simply by living in a sin-filled world (Romans 8:18-23). The fall into sin brought death and disease, hardships and sorrows.\nThankfully, you and I have a God who did something about all our problems: both physical and spiritual. He sent Jesus into the world to be our perfect Savior. He lived the perfect life we are supposed to but can\u2019t. He endured the punishment our sins deserved. Then, he rose triumphantly from the dead to prove that his life and death were accepted as the full payment for our sins.\nGod does want the very best for you. He has already given you his best, his Son, and he promises to give you whatever else you need in life (Romans 8:32). And the best is yet to come. The Lord is preparing for the time when you will meet him face-to-face (John 14:1-4). In the perfect life that awaits you and me and all Christians, there will be no more sin or sickness or disease or pain or death (Revelation 21:4). We look forward to that life, and we praise God for that life!\nI do hope that your pastor knows of your situation and is visiting you. Through word and sacrament he can reassure you of God\u2019s everlasting love (Isaiah 54:10). God be with you and bless you!"}

{"prompt": "The Mosaic law", "completion": "Some Adventists use Deuteronomy 31:9-10 and other verses to claim that the \"Law of Moses\" is different from the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20. I thought that Mosaic Law was a term used for all the Old Covenant laws, including the Ten Commandments. Is there a difference between the 'law of Moses' and the Decalogue in Exodus 20?\n\n\nWe can use the law of Moses, or the Mosaic law, to describe all the laws\u2014including the Ten Commandments\u2014God gave to the Old Testament people of Israel.\nThe civil and ceremonial laws do not apply to Christians today. God\u2019s moral law applies to all people of every day and age. The Ten Commandments serve as a good summary of the moral law, but even they contain ceremonial law language: the \u201cSabbath day\u201d in the third commandment and \u201clive long in the land the LORD your God is giving you\u201d in the fourth commandment.\nSeventh-day Adventists fail to recognize and teach the freedom from ceremonial laws that New Testament Christians have (Galatians 4:10; Colossians 2:16-17)."}
{"prompt": "Abrahamic religions", "completion": "I belong to the LCMS church and I am troubled they say Islam is part of the Abrahamic religions.  I am afraid they are allowing members to say that Muslims believe in the same god as Christians.  What is the WELS view on the god of Islam? \n\n\nI found this on the LCMS website: \u201cWhile it is true that there are certain common features among the three Abrahamic religions [Judaism, Christianity and Islam]\u2014the importance of Abraham, sacred scriptures, the worship of one God, and moral teachings\u2014these very commonalities represent significant differences among the three faiths. In addition, of the three religions, only the Christian faith points to the unique revelation of God in the person and saving work of Jesus Christ\u2026 Islam makes exclusive claims for Allah, and also rejects the Triune God\u2026The three religions differ significantly in their teachings about Jesus Christ. In Judaism, Jesus is not accepted as the Son of God or as the Messiah foretold by the prophets. The Qur\u2019an of Islam also denies the deity of Christ, stating that only Allah may be worshiped as Lord.\u201d\nIt is clear that your church is not teaching that Muslims believe in the same deity as Christians.\nThe God of Islam, Allah, does not exist. Muslims need to hear the gospel of Jesus Christ. \u201cSalvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved\u201d (Acts 4:12). Jesus alone is Savior."}
{"prompt": "Karma", "completion": "What is the WELS position on \u201ckarma,\u201d and how is it different than reaping what you sow?  Is it OK to use the term in conversation?\n\n\nKarma is the belief in Hinduism and Buddhism that people\u2019s actions in this life determine what happens in their next life. There are a couple of problems with that belief. Reincarnation is not a biblical teaching. In addition, karma is all about people\u2019s actions and a deity\u2019s response to them; it is thoroughly work righteousness. People are taught that they can improve their situation in the next life by being good in this life.\nGalatians 6:7-8 does state: \u201cDo not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.\u201d That information is from the only true God, the Triune God. Those words explain that if people live according to their sinful nature, they can expect \u201cdestruction.\u201d That is because such a life displays unbelief and impenitence, and the Bible clearly explains the end-of-life judgment that awaits the impenitent and unbelieving (1 Corinthians 6:9-10; Mark 16:16). On the other hand, faith in Jesus Christ saves (Mark 16:16), and in grateful response for their salvation Christians will live life \u201cto please the Spirit.\u201d There is nothing in Galatians 6:7-8 or elsewhere in the Bible that teaches work righteousness.\nYou may want to be careful in using \u201ckarma\u201d so you are not confused with people who believe in reincarnation and work righteousness.\nYou may want to be careful in using that word for another reason. In conversations today, people might use \u201ckarma\u201d to describe bad things catching up with people or people \u201cgetting what they deserved.\u201d Jesus warned against making connections between disastrous events in people\u2019s lives and their relationship with God (Luke 13:1-5). Rather than trying to make such connections, Jesus instructed us to take a look at our own lives: \u201cUnless you repent, you too will all perish\u201d (Luke 13:3, 5). Seeing calamities and tragedies in the lives of others is to move you and me to repentance. Our sins call for God\u2019s swift judgment, but we implore his mercy, and we praise him that \u201che does not treat us as our sins deserve\u201d (Psalm 103:10).\nWhen it comes to karma, I personally want to distance myself from its meaning and usage in every way."}

Forgive the sins I know and the sins I do not know. Forgive the sins I did to please myself and the sins I did to please others. Forgive them all, gracious Lord, for Jesus\u2019 sake\u201d (page 134).\nWhat does it mean when we ask God to do something for \u201cJesus\u2019 sake\u201d? \u201cBecause of what Jesus has done\u201d is a way of understanding \u201cfor Jesus\u2019 sake.\u201d In the prayer above, we ask God to forgive our sins. We do not ask God to do that because we are deserving of his kindness. No, our sins deserve condemnation. We ask God to forgive our sins because of what Jesus has done. What Jesus did was to live life as our perfect substitute and then take on himself the punishment our sins deserved. When we ask God to forgive our sins, as in the prayer above, we do so on the basis of what Jesus Christ has done for us (Titus 3:4-6)."}
{"prompt": "Establishing membership", "completion": "Can a person become a member now without going through the \"information\" classes?\n\n\nCommunicant membership in a congregation of our synod can come about by way of transfer from another congregation in our fellowship, adult confirmation or profession/affirmation of faith.\nIf an individual with a non-Lutheran background desires to become a communicant member of one of our congregations, a pastor would invite the person to attend the Bible information class (or one that is similarly named). There is no obligation to complete the course of instruction, but adult confirmation would be available to those who do so and confess that the instruction they have received is what the Bible teaches.\nIf an individual with a Lutheran background from outside our fellowship desires to become a communicant member of one of our congregations, a pastor would meet with the person and determine the best course of action to establish membership. One option would be to attend the Bible information class. Other options are available. Along with their pastors, our congregations enjoy some flexibility in determining how church membership is established."}

There are many people who have strong opinions both ways.  I am unable to find anything in the Bible that prohibits this.  The only intent is to not have children after marriage.\r\n\n\n\nChristian Life Resources, an agency within WELS, would be a good resource for you.

There are moral issues on which candidates take a stand in varying degrees.

There is plenty of objectionable content in movies today: sex outside marriage, violence, abusive behavior\u2014just to name a few. We do well to keep our distance from such \u201centertainment.\u201d Scripture clearly teaches that sinful thoughts are every much deserving of God\u2019s condemnation as sinful words and actions (Matthew 5:21-22, 28; 1 John 3:15).\nBecause what we read and watch and listen to affects us, there is good reason to implement this biblical instruction: \u201cFinally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable\u2014if anything is excellent or praiseworthy\u2014think about such things\u201d (Philippians 4:8).\nCondemning and banning all theater-going puts all movies into the same category.

{"prompt": "EFCA and WELS", "completion": "I grew up WELS and am still a member of a WELS church. My boyfriend attends an EFCA church. We have had discussions on the differences in what we believe, and the largest areas we struggle with are Baptism and Communion. He believes that they are only symbols and not means of grace. I have been struggling with how we differ in these views. In another question (difference between WELS and EFCA), it was mentioned that \"doctrinal errors\u2014any errors\u2014are serious and potentially destructive of saving faith.\" Would this be able to be further explained? Does that mean that believing in one way means you do not go to heaven? \r\nAlso, as my boyfriend and I continue these discussions, are there any devotions that would assist us as we dive further into these topics? Thank you for your assistance. \n\n\nYour boyfriend is accurately representing his church. The Evangelical Free Church of America (EFCA) teaches: \u201cThe Lord Jesus mandated two ordinances, baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper, which visibly and tangibly express the gospel. Though they are not the means of salvation, when celebrated by the church in genuine faith, these ordinances confirm and nourish the believer.\u201d What his church is not doing is accurately representing the Lord. The Bible teaches that God offers and gives forgiveness of sins, life and salvation through Baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper (Acts 2:38; Acts 22:16; Matthew 26:28).\nThe EFCA also teaches \u201cthe personal, bodily and premillennial return of our Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d Jesus explained to Pontius Pilate that his kingdom is not of this world (John 18:36).\nFrom its Statement of Faith one can also observe that the EFCA embraces ecumenism, and confuses the invisible church and visible churches.\n\u201cDoctrinal errors\u2014any errors\u2014are serious and potentially destructive of saving faith (Galatians 5:9)\u201d is how one response to a question similar to yours ended. What that sentence means is that it is always dangerous to deny what the Bible teaches. Jesus said, \u201cYour word is truth\u201d (John 17:17). He did not qualify the truthfulness of God\u2019s word by saying that some of it or most of it is true; he said all of it is true. In addition, God warns people not to change his word (Deuteronomy 4:2; Revelation 22:18-19).\nWhen the Bible states that \u201cA little yeast works through the whole batch of dough\u201d (Galatians 5:9), it means that one false doctrine can lead to others. Left unchecked, false doctrine in one area of the Bible can ultimately lead to false doctrine regarding Jesus Christ and salvation. That is why any false doctrine is important.\nWhat could be a good Bible study for you and your boyfriend is going through your respective churches\u2019 statements of faith. His is online. Yours is as well. This link will take you to This We Believe, a statement of belief of WELS. You will find many Bible passages in This We Believe that provide biblical support for what we believe. I encourage you both to look up those passages and discuss them. See what God says for himself in his word. God bless your study of his word!"}
{"prompt": "Guest at Communion service", "completion": "Can a non-Lutheran guest, who regularly attends a Presbyterian church, receive Communion at a WELS church?\n\n\nThe guest would be welcome to attend the worship service but not receive the Lord\u2019s Supper.\nThe reason for that is people express their closeness in faith and oneness with one another when they receive the sacrament together (1 Corinthians 10:17). If people who are not united in the faith were to receive the sacrament together, there would be a false picture of unity.\nPresbyterians and Lutherans have entirely different beliefs about the real presence of Jesus\u2019 body and blood in the sacrament. The Bible explains how serious it is to deny the real presence of the Lord\u2019s body and blood (1 Corinthians 11:29). If the guest were to receive the sacrament in one of our churches, he would be confessing by his actions that he believed in the real presence of Jesus\u2019 body and blood. Is that the confession he wants to make? If it is, there is a way for him to receive instruction in the Bible, join one of our congregations and then receive the sacrament\u2014along with other Christians who are making the same confession of faith.\nPastors of our congregations stand ready to explain all this to guests and to provide opportunities for instruction in God\u2019s word."}

{"prompt": "Figurative and literal language", "completion": "I was raised in the CLC and later, in my thirties, started attending WELS congregations. For many of those years I never fully believed the Lutheran teaching on the real presence. The Bible did not convince me that it was the proper understanding. I left the Lutheran church several years ago, however, I'm not afraid of being wrong and changing my position if the Scriptures show me that I'm wrong. My question:  I was told as a Lutheran that the simple words of Christ himself, \"This is my body, this is my blood\" is sufficient proof to support the teaching of the real presence. However, in John 6 Christ talks about himself and of eating his body and drinking his blood. Yet in \"The People's Bible\" the author says that this language was to be understood figuratively, not literally.  I am in agreement with the author and think that it would be supportive of my understanding of the Lord's Supper if Christ's words in Matt. 26:26 were not taken literally. So the question becomes: Why is Matt. 26:26 taken literally and John 6:53 figuratively? \n\n\nRecognizing and understanding context is so critical to accurate biblical interpretation. Consider the context of John 6:53. Going back to John 6:25, we see that that John is describing what happened after Jesus miraculously fed thousands with just five loaves of bread and two small fish.\nIn his conversation with the crowds who were looking for more \u201cmiracle food\u201d (John 6:26), Jesus shifted his language from literal to figurative. He spoke of the \u201cbread of God\u201d (John 6:33), and he identified himself as \u201cthe bread of life\u201d (John 6:35, 48, 51). Jesus spoke of the importance of believing in him (John 6:35, 40, 47). In John 6:51 Jesus describes faith in him as eating \u201cthe living bread that came down from heaven.\u201d In that same verse Jesus shifted the metaphor from bread to \u201cmy flesh,\u201d and in verse 53 he describes believing in him as eating \u201cthe flesh of the Son of Man and drink[ing] my blood\u201d \u2013 \u201cconsuming\u201d him in faith. (Also of interest at this point is the fact that Jesus spoke of his \u201cflesh\u201d and not his \u201cbody,\u201d as he would in the institution of the Lord\u2019s Supper. The original Greek has two different words for \u201cflesh\u201d and \u201cbody.\u201d)\nThe context of John 6 clearly shows the figurative language Jesus was using to describe the importance of believing in him. In addition, we need to keep in mind the historical context: at the time of John 6 Jesus had not yet instituted the Lord\u2019s Supper.\nWhen we look at the context of Matthew 26:26, we recognize a narrative in which Jesus is not using figurative language; his words were meant to be taken literally. There was nothing symbolic or figurative when Jesus took bread and wine and said, \u201cThis is my body. This is my blood.\u201d\nIn short, we derive accurate and intended meaning of Scripture when we pay attention to the context."}

We must forgive unconditionally, as God has forgiven us unconditionally, correct? \n\n\nOn the basis of Scripture, our Catechism states: \u201cThe use of the keys is that special power and right which Christ gave to his church on earth: to forgive the sins of penitent sinners but to refuse forgiveness to the impenitent as long as they do not repent.\u201d As Christians, the Lord has given us the keys to announce forgiveness to penitent sinners and to refuse forgiveness to people as long as they are impenitent (Matthew 16:19).\nIf someone has sinned against me and refuses to repent, I would not announce God\u2019s forgiveness to that person (John 20:23; 1 John 1:8, 10), but I would make sure that I did not harbor any personal animosity toward that person and jeopardize my own relationship with God (1 John 1:9; 3:15; 4:20).\nIf that person did eventually repent and seek my forgiveness and God\u2019s, I would be glad to give it. Failing to do so has serious implications (Matthew 6:14-15)."}
{"prompt": "Suicide and eternity", "completion": "Many acquaintances of acquaintances are committing suicide. In our town there have been four in the first two months of this year. So much heartbreak. Are these people condemned to hell for this act?\n\n\nGod\u2019s fifth commandment forbids suicide. God makes it clear in the Bible that only he\u2014directly or indirectly through his representatives in government\u2014has the right to end a person\u2019s life (Deuteronomy 32:39; Psalm 31:15; Psalm 90:3; Romans 13:4). God is serious about protecting a person\u2019s life because that is the only time a person has to be brought to saving faith in Jesus Christ.\nIn years past, individuals who took their own lives were often treated as a group: they were automatically considered to be people who were lost forever. In more recent times there has been a greater understanding of psychological and mental issues that might have contributed to a person taking his or her life, while still dying in the Christian faith. This does not minimize the seriousness of suicide or its tragic effects on survivors; it provides general explanation only. Certainly, those who end their lives in unbelief are lost forever. Unbelief condemns (Mark 16:16).\nBecause you and I are not able to look into the hearts of people (1 Samuel 16:7) who take their lives, we are not able to assign motives or reasons for their actions\u2014nor do we attempt to do so. God alone sees what is in the heart at a person\u2019s death, and judgment takes place (Hebrews 9:27). On the Last Day that judgment will be made public (Matthew 25:31-46).\nAs is the case with any death, the family and friends of a person who has committed suicide need our Christian support. We can direct them to God\u2019s word for the daily strength they need (Psalm 46). We can keep them in our prayers."}
{"prompt": "Hymnals and doctrinal fellowship", "completion": "I am a member of a WELS church that uses Christian Worship: A Lutheran Hymnal (CW) and Christian Worship: Supplement (CWS) as our main hymnals. I know that CW is the main hymnal of the synod, but some churches within the WELS still use The 1941 Lutheran Hymnal (TLH). I also know that soon the WELS will be publishing a new hymnal. My question is, do WELS congregations have to use the CW/CWS or TLH, or can congregations choose to use another confessional Lutheran hymnal, such as the 2006 LCMS Lutheran Service Book or even hymnals of other Christian denominations as either the main hymnal or a supplemental hymnal to the CW/TLH?\n\n\nSince God, in his word, has not specifically addressed a subject like this, the matter lies in the area of Christian freedom. When it comes to Christian freedom, the Bible does provide guidance. It instructs us to use our Christian freedom with an eye toward others (Romans 14; 1 Corinthians 8, 10). That means that we don\u2019t necessarily or automatically do what we want to do, but we take into account the thoughts and consciences of others.\nWhile our congregations and their choirs might occasionally use music and liturgical pieces from churches and organizations beyond our fellowship, the regular use of a hymnal from church bodies with whom we are not in doctrinal fellowship could easily prove to be confusing and bothersome to members of our congregations and the people who visit them. Personally, I would not want to generate such confusion and potential offense. More than providing me with outlets for action, Christian freedom also furnishes me with the right not to do something out of concern for others.\nAs with many other decisions that can be made, the choice of regular worship materials provides an opportunity for congregations to \u201cwalk together\u201d (that is the picture behind \u201csynod\u201d). We walk together not because we have to but because we want to. \u201cHow good and pleasant it is when God\u2019s people live together in unity!\u201d (Psalm 133:1)"}
{"prompt": "Suicides and funerals", "completion": "If a WELS member commits suicide, will a WELS church hold a funeral for them? \r\n\n\n\nI cannot give you a blanket \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer. A very recent question addressed the subject of suicide, and the answer noted differing factors that might have led someone to take his or her life. Part of the answer stated this: \u201cIn years past, individuals who took their own lives were often treated as a group: they were automatically considered to be people who were lost forever. In more recent times there has been a greater understanding of psychological and mental issues that might have contributed to a person taking his or her life, while still dying in the Christian faith. This does not minimize the seriousness of suicide or its tragic effects on survivors; it provides general explanation only. Certainly, those who end their lives in unbelief are lost forever. Unbelief condemns (Mark 16:16).\u201d\n\u201cBecause you and I are not able to look into the hearts of people (1 Samuel 16:7) who take their lives, we are not able to assign motives or reasons for their actions\u2014nor do we attempt to do so. God alone sees what is in the heart at a person\u2019s death, and judgment takes place (Hebrews 9:27). On the Last Day that judgment will be made public (Matthew 25:31-46).\u201d\nOur pastors do not pretend to know what was in the heart of a person who committed suicide. Again, only God has that information. What our pastors will seek to do is provide Christian comfort and encouragement (1 Thessalonians 4:18) through a funeral service when it appears the person who committed suicide died in the Christian faith\u2014no matter how weak that saving faith might have been.\nOn the other hand, our pastors will be careful not to give false hope or comfort, or misrepresent the teachings of their church, when it appears that the person who committed suicide rejected the Christian faith.\nOur pastors serve as representatives of their congregations. The actions they take reflect on the congregations they serve. Through the decisions they make regarding funeral services, our pastors seek to give the clearest testimony to others of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Through their words and actions, they want others to know that there is salvation only through Jesus Christ (Acts 4:12) and that acknowledging Jesus Christ as Savior is vitally important (Matthew 10:32)."}
{"prompt": "Help with prayers", "completion": "Howdy, I have a question about prayer. I understand that prayer is a very important part of our lives when being a Lutheran (or any religion for that matter). But when I pray, it feels empty inside, like there's no real meaning to it. Am I praying correctly? I begin my prayers with, \"Dear Father in heaven\", and end them with \"Amen\", but I think there's more to praying correctly than how it's formatted. Can you help me with why my prayers seem so shallow?     \n\n\nIt might be helpful if you were to think of how you would answer this question: \u201cWhat is prayer?\u201d How you look upon prayer and what you think about it can be in line with what the Bible says about prayer, or it might deviate from that.\nPrayer is the privilege Christians have of speaking to God. Prayer is the Christian\u2019s worshipful conversation with God. Prayer is the Christian\u2019s heart-to-heart talk with God. That conversation can include \u201cpetitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving\u201d (1 Timothy 2:1). That conversation is a running dialogue with God throughout the day.\nWhen you say that praying leaves you feeling empty, I would encourage you to keep emotions in proper perspective. God\u2019s law (2 Corinthians 7:8-11) and God\u2019s gospel (Psalm 51:12) can certainly produce emotions of sorrow and joy in our hearts and lives. What we want to be careful about is basing our relationship with God on our emotions.\nThe same caution is applicable for prayer. When you and I pray to God as his redeemed children, we know and believe that he will hear our prayers and answer them in the best way and at the best time. You and I might have different emotional levels attached to that knowledge and faith when we pray at different times of life and in different circumstances. Yet, keep in mind that the power of prayer does not lie in our emotions. The power of prayer lies in our all-powerful God.\nWhat I do not know is the content of your prayers. Even without that knowledge, I can suggest that, if you are not doing so already, you might want to supplement your own personal prayers with prayers prepared by others. There are many prayers available in our hymnal, on the synod\u2019s website and in prayer books. Using those prayers can certainly expand your prayer life. Perhaps you would also find value and benefit in prayer journaling. Northwestern Publishing House has numerous resources for your prayer life.\nI hope this gives you some help. God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Philip of Hesse", "completion": "Luther condoned, albeit very reluctantly, Philip of Hesse taking a second wife.  I say his doing so was a matter of necessity to keep alive the split from a Roman Church many times more corrupt than the actions of one single prince, but I defer to your wise counsel.  Thanks & Sola Fide.\n\n\nMartin Luther\u2019s confidential counsel to Philip of Hesse is not one with which we can agree. While that counsel was consistent with what he had written in \u201cThe Babylonian Captivity of the Church,\u201d it is an example of confessional Lutherans today not endorsing everything Martin Luther wrote or did.\nBecause the matter was intended to remain confidential, it is a matter of speculation to try to identify Luther\u2019s motives. If the motive was to further the cause of the Reformation, that goal was not immediately successful because the fallout of the bigamous relationship brought criticism for Luther and hardships for Philipp of Hesse; Philip soon lost his influence as leader of the Smalcald League. If the motive was pastoral concern\u2014as most believe\u2014then the confidential advice was simply intended to address a complicated situation.\nWhat can be said with certainty is that God blessed the efforts of the many reformers and confessors who defended the gospel of Jesus Christ. We today are the beneficiaries of those efforts and that blessing."}
{"prompt": "\"Your holy angel\"", "completion": "Who is \"your holy angel\" in Luther's prayer?  I notice that it isn't capitalized, but they must have power over \"the wicked foe,\" who I assume is Satan.\n\n\nThe holy angels are those angels who did not join in with Satan (\u201cthe wicked foe\u201d) and other angels in rebelling against God (2 Peter 2:4). The holy angels are \u201cministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation\u201d (Hebrews 1:14). The holy angels carry out God\u2019s command \u201cto guard you in all your ways\u201d (Psalm 91:11). The \u201choly angel\u201d in Martin Luther\u2019s prayers references any of the heavenly host whom God might choose to use to carry out his good and gracious will in our lives. Might God use a single angel on occasion? Yes. Might he use more than one angel on occasion? Yes.\nThe Bible does not state specifically that God has assigned a guardian angel to each Christian. While it would be comforting to know that God has matched one angel to us for life-time service and protection, it is even more comforting to know that God employs angels\u2014plural\u2014in his providential care of each Christian.\nGod\u2019s gracious use of angels in our lives provides another reason for praising God. \u201cLord God, to you we all give praise; To you our joyful hymns we raise That angel hosts you did create Around your glorious throne to wait. But watchful is the angel band That follows Christ on ev\u2019ry hand To guard his people where they go And break the counsel of the foe. O Lord, awaken songs of praise For angel hosts that guard our days; Teach us to serve you and adore As angels do forevermore.\u201d (Christian Worship 196:1, 5-6)"}
{"prompt": "Laestadian Lutherans", "completion": "What are the differences between the WELS and the Laestadian Lutherans?\n\n\nLaestadian Lutherans trace their origins to northern Scandinavia. There have been many different groups who called themselves Laestadian Lutherans over the years, so a common description does not come easily.\nI can point you to this general information from WELS and Other Lutherans: \u201cDisciples of the Laestadian Movement are adherents of literal biblical interpretation. Great emphasis is placed on mankind\u2019s inherent sinfulness. Conversion to the true faith is evoked by the confessing of sin before a congregation. This may then be followed by confession to one of the movement\u2019s leaders who will grant forgiveness of sin by a laying on of hands. The Laestadians are stern, pietistic Lutherans with strict morals. They are usually extremely conservative in ethical and religious issues.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "People and the image of God", "completion": "I don't understand how Lutheran theologians reconcile James 3:9 and Gen 9:6 with the idea the image of God is completely lost in the fall. It makes more sense to me that the image became corrupted, as opposed to completely lost. How do WELS pastors interpret James 3:9 and Genesis 9:6?\n\n\nBeing created in the image of God meant that Adam and Eve were holy, they had perfect knowledge of God\u2019s will, and their wills were entirely aligned with God\u2019s will. After the fall into sin, the Bible tells us Adam had a child in his likeness and image, not God\u2019s (Genesis 5:1-3). Since the fall into sin, human beings born of sinful people have entered this world as sinners (Psalm 51:5), enemies of God (Romans 8:7) and people whose natural will is opposed to God\u2019s will (Romans 7:7-23). Despite this natural sinful condition, people still have a natural knowledge of God from creation and their conscience, and they naturally know the basics of God\u2019s law (Psalm 19:1-4; Hebrews 3:4; Romans 2:14-15). While there are some Lutheran theologians who speak of people still being made, in a limited sense, in the image of God insofar as they have intellect and will, it is more consistent with Scripture to say that the image of God was lost through the fall into sin and is restored in Christians.\nEphesians 4:24 instructs us to \u201cput on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.\u201d Colossians 3:10 has a similar directive: \u201c\u2026put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator.\u201d Genesis 9:6 and James 3:9 are passages that some theologians cite to indicate that after the fall into sin people are born in the image of God in a limited sense. When we understand the image of God especially denoting holiness and loving only that which God loves, then we see those particular passages speaking of the original condition of people, which is no longer the case because of sin.\nCertainly, each person receives life from God (Acts 17:25) and each person is the object of God\u2019s love in Christ (John 3:16; 1 John 2:2). Beyond those blessings is the working of the Holy Spirit in people\u2019s hearts through the gospel, connecting them to Jesus Christ and the salvation he won. In Christians the image of God is being restored (2 Corinthians 3:18; Ephesians 4:24; Colossians 3:10), and it will be fully restored when Christians leave this world of sin (Psalm 17:15; 1 Corinthians 13:9-12; 1 John 3:2)"}
{"prompt": "Sin and death", "completion": "Would God take the life of a loved one to admonish the sin that another person is involved in?\n\n\nBecause I do not know what might lie behind your question, all I can do is respond in a general way. Your question has me think of how God worked in the lives of David and Bathsheba. God\u2019s determination was that the child conceived and born from their adulterous relationship would die (2 Samuel 12:14-18). While God holds people personally responsible for their own sinfulness and sins (Ezekiel 18:4) and does not punish children for the sins of their parents (Ezekiel 18:20), one of the temporal consequences of David and Bathsheba\u2019s sin was that the child born to them would die in infancy.\nWhen I consider that action on God\u2019s part, thoughts like these come to mind: \u201cOur God is in heaven; he does whatever pleases him\u201d (Psalm 115:3). \u201cGod is not unjust\u201d (Hebrews 6:10). \u201cFor my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,\u201d declares the LORD. \u201cAs the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts\u201d (Isaiah 55:8-9). \u201cOh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out! \u201cWho has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?\u201d \u201cWho has ever given to God, that God should repay them?\u201d For from him and through him and for him are all things. To him be the glory forever! Amen.\u201d (Romans 11:33-36).\nOne very important thing to keep in mind is that God, in the Bible, tells us why the son born to David and Bathsheba died in infancy. If we did not have that information in the Bible, we would not have known why the child died. That means that when the death of a person takes place today, we cannot pretend to speak for God when he has not spoken on the matter. So, while the Bible answers your question in the affirmative regarding God\u2019s past actions, all we can do is maintain that possibility\u2014in a general way\u2014concerning God\u2019s present and future actions."}
{"prompt": "Writers of the gospels", "completion": "I have recently read articles and videos saying that no one knows who wrote the gospels - that there was no way Matthew, Mark, Luke and John could have written them. They even stated that they were not even written by eyewitnesses. They had a lot of info to back this up. Please tell me this is false.\n\n\nThis is false. Without knowing which articles you read and videos you saw, I can say that the content reflects the historical-critical method of biblical interpretation. That method rejects the verbal inspiration of the Bible. So, if people reject the truth that the Holy Spirit inspired Matthew, Mark, Luke and John to write the books of the Bible named after them, they have to come up with an alternative.\nThe alternative is a confused mess that allows \u201cscholars\u201d to pick and choose what they want to accept as being from God. The alternative theorizes that oral stories about Jesus developed first. Eventually, people put those stories into print. Finally, editors\u2014in the second century A.D.\u2014put the gospels in finished format.\nThe apostle Peter spoke for all the apostles when he wrote: \u201cFor we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. He received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, saying, \u2018This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.\u2019 We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the sacred mountain\u201d (2 Peter 1:16-18)."}
{"prompt": "Forgiving sinners", "completion": "I don't understand how the forgiveness that we give to others in the Fifth Petition differs from the forgiveness that we withhold from the impenitent in the use of the Keys.\r\nThe (Kuske) Catechism describes the forgiveness of the Fifth Petition as including \"anyone who sins against us,\" and again as \"all who sin against us.\"\r\nIn response to a similar question asked earlier, Q & A did not agree with the unconditional forgiveness that writer thought necessary.   When does the impenitence of \"those who trespass against us\" become the deciding factor in whom we forgive?  Does the new Catechism clarify this in its discussion of the Fifth Petition?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n \n\n\nThe context of questions is always important, and that context is often missing from questions that are submitted. When there are questions about forgiving others, we need to keep a number of things in mind.\nIf a person has sinned against us and is impenitent, we exhibit our Christian faith by harboring no grudges or ill will against that person. We have the privilege of telling the person we personally forgive him or her for the sin committed, but we want the individual to know that God\u2019s forgiveness is so much more important than the forgiveness we express. Repentance, of course, is paramount to enjoying forgiveness from God.\nAn answer to a similar question in Forward in Christ proposed this example of a conversation to an impenitent sinner: \u201cI fully and freely forgive you, sinner to sinner. I hold no grudge against you, seek no retaliation, and will keep no record of wrongs. I have no desire or need for this. My Lord Jesus is my ultimate Protector and he will satisfy justice in the end. Vengeance is his to give, not mine. But please understand that this may really mean very little for your long-term well-being. If and as long as you do not repent before God of your sin, you do not enjoy the forgiveness Christ earned for you. You forfeit personal benefit of his pardon. That is the forgiveness I seek for you but cannot give or announce to you at this time. That is the forgiveness you need most of all. You have my forgiveness, given cheerfully in love. But just like me, a sinner like you, you need the personal enjoyment of Christ\u2019s forgiveness, which is also freely given. I am willing to do anything I can to help you enjoy this.\u201d\nEven when Christians represent God and, out of concern for the sins and impenitence of others, exercise the \u201cbinding key\u201d and retain the sins of the impenitent (John 20:23), they seek to display a Christ-like love to others and avoid any personal animosity towards those who have sinned against them and remain impenitent."}
{"prompt": "Reason for creation", "completion": "Why did God create the universe? I am struggling with \u2019s motivation with creating us and the world. I know  is a tall task. I am hoping for some explanation from the Bible as to why God created us. My sinful nature keeps me coming back to the answer that this world is some strange experiment of God\u2019s or that he was bored. I know this is not the case because God already knows all of history. But I don\u2019t have any other biblical truth to show insight to God\u2019s reasoning. \n\n\nWe can rule out boredom or loneliness as reasons for God creating this world and the people who inhabit it. The Bible states: \u201cThe God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by human hands. And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything. Rather, he himself gives everyone life and breath and everything else\u201d (Acts 17:24-25).\nPsalm 149:4 informs us as to God\u2019s reason for creating everything: \u201cFor the LORD takes delight in his people.\u201d It was not to fill a void that moved God into creative action. No, God became the Creator because of his desire for people to share in his goodness and glory. And of course that takes place when people are led to embrace Jesus Christ, the Son of God, in faith as their Savior (John 3:16).\nKeep fighting the thoughts of your sinful nature. It is entirely opposed to God (Romans 8:7). Continue to build up your new self through regular use of God\u2019s gospel in word and sacrament."}
{"prompt": "Guest and the Lord's Supper", "completion": "As an ELCA church member, will I be permitted to receive Communion in a WELS church?\n\n\nWhen you attend a Holy Communion service in a WELS church, you might read something like the following in the church bulletin: \u201cThe Lord\u2019s Supper, or Holy Communion, will be celebrated in today\u2019s service. The Bible teaches us that Jesus offers us his body and blood for the forgiveness of our sins in the Lord\u2019s Supper. The Bible also instructs us that receiving the Lord\u2019s Supper together is a public expression of our complete \u2018oneness,\u2019 or unity of faith.\n\u201cBecause the Lord\u2019s Supper is an expression of our unity in faith, we invite to the Lord\u2019s Supper only those who have expressed that unity with us through membership in our congregation or one of our sister congregations in the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS), or our sister denomination in the United States, the Evangelical Lutheran Synod (ELS).\n\u201cIf you are a guest from another Christian church, we kindly ask that you refrain from participation in our celebration of the Lord\u2019s Supper today.

This freedom recognizes that there are commonly-agreed upon practices and also local customs concerning the lighting of altar candles.\nI do not know the worship practices of your church (for example, traditional altar or freestanding altar; number of candles, etc.), but it is common to light altar candles for every worship service and also to light other candles for Holy Communion worship services.\nWhen it comes to the lighting of the Paschal candle, again, I do not know the worship practices of your congregation. If your church offers the Triduum (a service encompassing three days), then the Paschal candle is usually lit at the Vigil of Easter. If there is no Triduum, the Paschal candle is usually lit at the first Easter Sunday worship service. Common practice is that the Paschal candle is lit throughout the Easter season and then removed at the Ascension worship service. It is used again at baptisms and funeral services.\nWe want our worship practices to be meaningful and sensible. Thinking of how you would explain the meaning and purpose of your congregation\u2019s worship practices to fellow members and guests can be helpful in retaining or revising those practices.\nThe Altar Guild Manual by Lee Maxwell is a book that could benefit your altar guild.\nI hope this gives you some help."}
{"prompt": "Pietism", "completion": "Is the WELS affiliated with Lutheran Pietism at all?\n\n\nA very recent Q & A mentioned a Lutheran church body that is pietistic in nature. WELS is not affiliated with that church body.\nThere was a Pietistic Movement in the history of the Lutheran Church and, years later, the movement\u2019s influence was felt in the early years of our church body.\nIf you are interested in reading more about the topic, this link will take you to an essay from the Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary Essay File. This link will provide you with information on two books from Northwestern Publishing House."}
{"prompt": "Cigarette smoking", "completion": "I have a question regarding cigarette smoking.  Is smoking cigarettes excessively gluttony?\n\n\n\u201cGluttony\u201d is usually defined as \u201cexcessive eating or drinking.\u201d \u201cChain smoking\u201d might approach what your question is addressing.\nWhen it comes to the subject of smoking, Christians will want to keep in mind the fifth commandment issues of taking care of the body and health God has given them (along with being concerned about the welfare of others), and the seventh commandment matter of managing faithfully the resources God has entrusted to them."}
{"prompt": "View of Baptism", "completion": "What does WELS say about baptism?\n\n\n\u201cWe believe that also through the Sacrament of Baptism the Holy Spirit applies the gospel to sinners, giving them new life (Titus 3:5) and cleansing them from all sin (Acts 2:38). The Lord points to the blessing of Baptism when he promises, \u201cWhoever believes and is baptized will be saved\u201d (Mark 16:16). We believe that the blessing of Baptism is meant for all people (Matthew 28:19), including infants. Infants are born sinful (John 3:6) and therefore need to be born again, that is, to be brought to faith, through Baptism (John 3:5).\n\u201cWe reject the view that babies should not be baptized and that they cannot believe in Christ (Luke 18:15-17). We reject the view that baptism must be by immersion.\u201d\nThose statements are from This We Believe: A Statement of Belief of the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod. This link will take you to those statements in context."}
{"prompt": "Help for son", "completion": "My son has been struggling at our WELS school for a few years. His teacher is good. He just doesn't fit in. We are trying to decide if we should send him to public school instead. I am worried that making this choice will hurt him, as I am a faithful believer in the benefits of a Christian education.  However, he is so unhappy. Our pastor isn't very approachable, and the teacher/principal has tried and is a good guy, but it just isn't working for my son. Any advice? \n\n\nI am sorry, but I would really need answers to quite a few questions before I might be able to pass along any meaningful, practical advice. Questions like: How old is your son? How long has he been a student in the WELS school? In what way(s) does your son feel like he does not fit in? How long has he had that feeling? When did it begin? Are there times or situations when he feels out of place more than others? Besides conversations with your teacher and pastor, what other actions have you taken to help your son fit in? How will changing schools make it possible for your son to fit in there?\nBecause those questions are unanswered for me, let me pass along some important, practical advice a wise Christian gave my wife and me years ago when we were raising our children. He said, \u201cYou have only one chance to raise your children.\u201d It was an obvious observation then and now, but sometimes we can be oblivious to the obvious. That man\u2019s words reminded me to make the most of every opportunity in raising my children\u2014especially to \u201cbring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord\u201d (Ephesians 6:4).\nCertainly, parents have the primary responsibility of raising their children. That includes having them baptized and instructed in God\u2019s word. It is a blessing indeed when Christian parents can receive assistance in their spiritual responsibilities through a congregation\u2019s school. Your words recognize that. It goes without saying that not all Christian parents are in a position to benefit from that kind of assistance: there may not be such a school nearby. This is why I would encourage you to explore all options of keeping your son enrolled in your congregation\u2019s school. You can bring up your son \u201cin the training and instruction of the Lord\u201d apart from that school, but you can receive so much help in carrying out your responsibilities with that school in your life.\nOne final thought \u2013 if you are not able to speak about this with your pastor, have you considered Christian counseling from other sources? Christian Family Solutions, an agency within WELS, offers video counseling from the privacy of your home. \u201cParenting and family issues\u201d is one of the issues they address. This link will take you to the appropriate part of their website. God bless you and your son!"}
{"prompt": "Undiluted wine", "completion": "Is it sinful to drink undiluted wine?  A Baptist is telling me that it is sinful to drink wine that is not diluted with at least three parts water to one part wine.  He claims all wine was diluted in biblical times.  This seems strange since Isaiah 1:22 seems to speak of diluted wine in a negative sense.\n\n\nWine was often diluted in biblical times because water was not abundant in some places or of the best quality.\nWhile Christians today can certainly follow an Old Testament custom or practice if they like, it is not sinful if they do not. There are no New Testament ceremonial laws. It is not sinful to drink undiluted wine.\nYou are correct in noting the negative sense of diluted wine in Isaiah 1:22. That verse uses figurative language to describe the spiritual unfaithfulness of the people of Jerusalem in Isaiah\u2019s day."}
{"prompt": "Scripture Alone", "completion": "Does 2 Thessalonians 2:15 contradict Sola Scriptura (Scripture alone)?\n\n\nNot at all. The Greek word that the apostle Paul used in 2 Thessalonians 2:15 (and 3:6) means \u201cthat which is handed down.\u201d In 2 Thessalonians 2:14 Paul reminded the Thessalonian Christians that God had called them to faith through the gospel message. The teaching of the gospel is that on which the Thessalonians were to stand and hold fast to (2 Thessalonians 2:15).\nTranslations like the 2011 NIV include a footnote for 2 Thessalonians 2:15 and 3:6 \u2013 \u201cor tradition(s).\u201d The Greek word that Paul used in those verses can mean tradition, depending on the context. We find that meaning, for example, in Matthew 15:3, 6. Because context determines the meaning of words, \u201cthat which is handed down\u201d in 2 Thessalonians 2:15 and 3:6 is clearly the gospel teachings of the apostle Paul to the Thessalonians and not human pronouncements or church traditions.\nThe Bible consistently teaches Sola Scriptura (Scripture alone) \u2013 Ephesians 2:20."}
{"prompt": "Divorce and remarriage", "completion": "I got divorced almost two years ago and, although we have no contact, I was informed by someone else that my ex-husband is considering getting remarried. He was a WELS member but has apparently transferred to a different denomination or perhaps a non-denominational church. While I am not dating anyone at this time, my question is, if my ex-husband does get married again, am I permitted to remarry? \n\n\nQuestions of divorce and remarriage are handled best by the parish pastors who know the circumstances of the divorce that took place along with the attitudes of the people involved. With that in mind, I would direct you to speak to your pastor about this."}
{"prompt": "Pastors receiving calls", "completion": "I feel my question should be addressed by WELS President.  How can it happen that a pastor can receive two calls on the same day?  This certainly seems like overkill and places unnecessary stress on that pastor and his family and also the involved congregations. I realize there is a shortage of pastors.  Some receive two calls on the same day, some never receive a call.  That is also something synod should address.  If those pastors never receive a call, shouldn't there be some coaching involved to possibly assist them in their calling and guide them?  It would also take strain off those who receive 10 or 11 calls.  I appreciate your comment.\r\n\r\n \n\n\nA pastor can receive two calls on the same day if, for some reason, he is on two call lists that are presented to two different calling bodies on the same day. District presidents, who assemble the call lists, do maintain close contact with each other so that the scenario of a pastor receiving two calls on the same day is exceptional rather than routine. Even though the Call is divine and from God, our process is a human one. That means that, while we try to do the best we can, the process itself might not always work as we intend it to work.\nIn the case of a pastor not receiving another call for an extended period of time, the synod through its district presidents can do only so much. Unbeknownst to you and me, a pastor can be on call lists in different locations and not be the one called, and so it can seem like the pastor is not being considered for other calls. That situation does not call for \u201ccoaching\u201d of any kind. I would say that God has his good reasons for that pastor to continue his ministry in that location.\nWith the pastoral vacancy rate that currently exists in our synod, it is not surprising that pastors are receiving calls from other calling bodies more frequently than in the past. Your question is a good reminder for all of us to \u201cAsk the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field\u201d (Matthew 9:38). The recruitment of young people to serve in the public ministry has always been important. It is very important today.\n(I did provide President Schroeder with an opportunity to view your question\u2014and the answer, which he approved.)"}
{"prompt": "Attitudes toward sin", "completion": "A friend says that if she believes in Jesus she can live any way she wants and still go to heaven.  I know one should not sin, but I can't find any Scripture that tells me that in conjunction with being saved.  She has grown up in the church and is pretty knowledgeable.  My go-to passage has always been \"Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved.\"  It doesn't add anything.  I know we would not want to sin after receiving this gift, but I don't know what to tell her.  It doesn't say believe and live a good life and you will be saved.  She is baptized and confirmed and educated in archeology and history, which is part of her having issues with the Bible.  She wants to be saved but has doubts.  What do I tell her?  I know she will not go out and sin just because she can, but there are others with and without faith who ask the same questions and I don't have an answer.\n\n\nI commend you for your concern for your friend. A cavalier attitude toward sin is very dangerous. You might consider sharing the following Bible passages with your friend: Romans 6:1-4; 8:13-14; Ephesians 4:30; Hebrews 10:26; 2 Peter 2:20-22; and, 1 John 3:6. Those verses speak of the danger of deliberately violating God\u2019s holy will.\nSaving faith, Christian faith, is trust in Jesus Christ as Savior. Christian faith is a matter of the heart, but the Bible (especially the book of James) makes it clear that Christian faith is not confined to the head or heart but is visible in everyday life. You can remind your friend of Jesus\u2019 words: \u201cIf you love me, keep my commands\u2026 Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them. Anyone who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me\u201d (John 14:15, 23-24).\nI do not show love for Jesus when I live anyway I want to\u2014thinking that I have God\u2019s forgiveness no matter what. No, I show love for Jesus when I fight against temptation and sin the best I can. I show love for Jesus when I recognize the high price he paid to win forgiveness for my sins and then live my life for him (2 Corinthians 5:15). God bless your efforts to share the truths of his word with your friend."}
{"prompt": "Hating family members", "completion": "Can you explain in Luke 14:26-27 if Jesus is actually telling us that we must hate our father and mother, wife and children, brother and sister and even self in order to be his disciple?\n\n\nThe Greek word for \u201chate\u201d in that verse is one that the New Testament uses many times, in different contexts, to express \u201cstrong dislike for\u201d or \u201chostility toward\u201d someone.\nOther parts of Scripture can help us understand what Jesus is saying in those verses. The fourth commandment instructs children to love and honor their parents (Exodus 20:12; Ephesians 6:1-2). The Bible tells us that hating others is sinful (1 John 3:15). Jesus tells us to not to return hatred with hatred but, \u201cLove your enemies, do good to those who hate you\u201d (Luke 6:27).\nSo, what can Jesus mean with those words in Luke 14:26-27? He is using striking language to tell us that he comes first in life. That is the heart of the first commandment, isn\u2019t it? No one, not even our parents, is to occupy the top spot in our hearts. No one, not even self, is to be the number one love of our lives. While we are to love all people, including obviously family members, we are to love God most of all. Jesus said, \u201cAnyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me\u201d (Matthew 10:37-38).\nThe wider context of Scripture informs us that \u201chate\u201d in Luke 14:26-27 means \u201cto love less.\u201d We are to love our family members, but we are to love our heavenly Father, our brother Jesus and the Holy Spirit first and foremost."}
{"prompt": "Importance of Baptism", "completion": "Must an infant be baptized to go to heaven?\n\n\nAs Jesus instituted Baptism, your question addresses children in New Testament times only. The Bible is silent on the fate of children who die without the benefit of Baptism. What the Bible does say is that Christian faith saves but unbelief\u2014not the lack of Baptism\u2014condemns. Jesus said, \u201cWhoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned\u201d (Mark 16:16).\nWe speak of Baptism being necessary in the sense that Jesus instructs us to administer it. Baptism is not absolutely necessary in that the Holy Spirit can create faith through the word of God alone.\nCan God work faith in children apart from Baptism? Certainly. Since conversion is God\u2019s gracious, powerful work in people\u2019s hearts, God can create faith through the word of God alone or through the word of God connected to an earthly element: Baptism.\nBecause the Bible instructs us to baptize \u201call nations\u201d (Matthew 28:19), including children, and speaks of the Holy Spirit working through Baptism (John 3:5-6; Titus 3:5), we bring our children to be baptized. Christian parents follow that up with instruction in God\u2019s word (Matthew 28:20; Ephesians 6:4)."}
{"prompt": "A surpassing righteousness", "completion": "Can you please explain Matthew 5:20 in relation to the doctrine of salvation by faith alone?  I always understood the doctrine of faith alone to mean that someone is not saved by their own righteousness, but rather by their faith in Jesus.  \n\n\nYour understanding is correct. Let\u2019s see what Jesus\u2019 words mean in the light of their immediate context and the wider context of Scripture.\n\u201cFor I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven\u201d (Matthew 5:20). In Jesus\u2019 day, many people regarded the Pharisees and the teachers of the law as exemplary models of godly living. The Pharisees prided themselves in outward obedience of God\u2019s laws and their own laws.\nWithout faith in Jesus, the promised Messiah, their \u201crighteousness,\u201d the outwardly good things they were doing in life, meant nothing to God. \u201cWithout faith it is impossible to please God\u201d (Hebrews 11:6). The only righteousness the Pharisees and the teachers of the law had was what we call \u201ccivic righteousness.\u201d They were good citizens.\nWith that in mind, Jesus stated: \u201cFor I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven\u201d (Matthew 5:20). Keep in mind Jesus\u2019 audience. These words are part of the Lord\u2019s sermon on the mount. He was speaking to his followers\u2014people who were joined to him in faith. The only way that his followers\u2019 righteousness could surpass that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law was through his righteousness.\nJust a few verses earlier, Jesus had said, \u201cDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them\u201d (Matthew 5:17). Jesus, and only Jesus, kept God\u2019s law perfectly all his life. Jesus is \u201cthe Righteous One\u201d (1 John 2:1). Through faith in Jesus his righteousness is credited to people like you and me. And so in that way, \u201cour\u201d righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law.\nMartin Luther put it this way: \u201cLord Jesus, you are my righteousness, I am your sin. You took on you what was mine; yet set on me what was yours. You became what you were not, that I might become what I was not.\u201d\nI hope this helps clarify your understanding of Matthew 5:20."}
{"prompt": "Predestination questions", "completion": "What difference does it make as to how long it is before Christ returns if we are predestined by God to be saved or not be saved? I have read many times that God's efforts to save as many souls as possible before his return is of utmost importance to him. That does not jibe in my (little) mind. Is it that some predestined souls may not even be born yet or have not had the time or opportunity to repent ? Maybe my understanding of predestination is all wrong. To be honest, I have a problem with the whole predestined plan. Why would my neighbor be going to heaven and not me? What would make her any better in God's eyes than me (considering we share the same beliefs)? I always think of Job and how he lost everything in the contest between God and the devil. God may have given him back everything he lost and more, but what about his family members? I understand his wife was against God but were they all non-fearing of God? Strike down my child today but give me another and all should be good again? I am totally confused. Also are WELS churches the only church predestined to live with God in heaven or are others included? I mean no disrespect. Please help me to understand.\n\n\nWe are not predestined by God to be saved or not be saved. The doctrine of predestination or election is God\u2019s gracious election to faith and salvation. That election took place in eternity (Ephesians 1:4-6; Romans 8:29-30). There is no election to damnation. People are to blame for their damnation (Jeremiah 15:6; Matthew 23:37).\nThe doctrine of election underscores the grace of God. There was nothing in people that moved him to elect them to faith and salvation. All people are naturally sinful and enemies of God (Psalm 51:5; Romans 8:7). God\u2019s grace alone is the reason for his election of people to faith and salvation.\nWhile the doctrine of election challenges our minds, it is intended to comfort our hearts. If any part of our salvation were up to us, there would be reason for uncertainty. More than that, we would be doomed. The Bible teaches that our salvation is God\u2019s work\u2014from beginning to end. That beginning took place in eternity. After our lives on earth began, God saw to it that we came into contact with his gospel so the Holy Spirit could create saving faith. The doctrine of election means that our lives on this earth will end with saving faith in our hearts. Election, conversion, justification, preservation in the faith\u2014all that is God\u2019s work, and God\u2019s work makes our salvation certain and sure.\nWhen it comes to Job\u2019s children, the Bible does not specifically speak of their relationship to God. Job chapter one describes Job as a devout and conscientious parent who cared deeply for his children. It would be easy to picture Job teaching his children the one true faith, but of course Job could not believe for his children; faith is a personal matter. Since we do not know the outcome of Job\u2019s children, we leave them in the hands of God.\nRegarding your last question, WELS does not maintain that it alone is the kingdom of God. Recall what you confess in the Apostles\u2019 Creed. You believe in \u201cthe holy Christian Church, the communion of saints.\u201d That Church consists of people throughout the world who believe in Jesus Christ as their Savior and trust only in him for their salvation. We state in This We Believe: \u201cAll people who believe that Jesus is their Savior from sin are members of the holy Christian church, regardless of the nation, race, or church body to which they belong.\u201d\nYou might benefit from \u201cPredestination,\u201d a book from Northwestern Publishing House. Your church library may also have a copy.\nI cannot unravel a mystery like election/predestination for you, but I hope things are a little bit clearer."}
{"prompt": "Bisexuality", "completion": "Can a Christian be bisexual? \n\n\nYou want to distinguish between a Christian who struggles with same-sex temptations in repentance and faith, and a person who identifies as a Christian but engages in sexual activity with impenitent and unbelieving attitudes.\nIn the former case, the Christian struggles against sin and sometimes loses the battle (Romans 7:15-25) but confesses sins to God, receives his forgiveness in faith and resolves, with God\u2019s help and strength, to use life to his glory. In the latter case, the person claims to be a Christian but rejects God\u2019s word and defends his or her sinfulness. Impenitence is incompatible with saving faith (1 Corinthians 6:9-10).\nThe Bible clearly teaches that sexual activity is designed for marriage (Hebrews 13:4), between a man and a woman (Genesis 2:19-24; Exodus 20:14; Matthew 19:4-6; Romans 1:26-27). Bisexual behavior is sinful.\nAs with any sin, there is forgiveness of sins through faith in Jesus Christ (Mark 16:16; Hebrews 7:27; 1 John 1:9). Grateful for their forgiveness, Christians will strive to avoid sin as best they can (Romans 6:1-4; 2 Corinthians 5:15)."}
{"prompt": "Self-defense", "completion": "Is killing (not murder) in self-defense justified?\n\n\nGod\u2019s fifth commandment has the purpose of protecting life, a person\u2019s time of grace (Isaiah 55:6). God allows his representatives in government to take life\u2014by punishing criminals or protecting a country\u2019s citizens in times of war (Romans 13:1-4). God\u2019s fifth commandment prohibits murder, which is the illicit taking of human life.\nProtecting our own life (self-defense) could result in the death of another person. That is not murder; the loss of life can be justified. Exodus 22:2-3 illustrates the law God gave his people of Israel regarding defending oneself from a thief."}
{"prompt": "Witchcraft", "completion": "Why does the sin of 'witchcraft' fall under taking God's name in vain?\n\n\nOur Catechisms explain it this way: \u201cPeople misuse God\u2019s name in using witchcraft because they depend on the power of the devil. People misuse God\u2019s name in using witchcraft because they seek the help of those who do things by the power of the devil.\u201d (1982, 1989, 1998 Catechism) \u201cIf we practice witchcraft, are involved with the occult, or are superstitious (believing in good luck charms, etc.), we are sinning against God\u2019s name because we are trusting in power that ultimately comes from Satan and is opposed to the power and will of God.\u201d (2017 Catechism)\nGod wants people to call upon him for help. We use God\u2019s name to do so. Witchcraft seeks help apart from God and so despises his name (Deuteronomy 18:10-12; Leviticus 19:31)."}
{"prompt": "Method of baptizing", "completion": "While I understand the method we use to apply water in Baptism is not what makes it valid, it is God's Word connected with the water that makes it valid. There are some who believe only total submersion is valid.  I've seen a list of scriptural references to sprinkling and pouring. Such a go-to reference would come in handy as I do outreach work.  Thanks in advance for sharing if the reference is readily available. \n\n\nIn earlier usage \u2014in the last centuries of the Old Testament era\u2014the Greek word \u201cbaptizo\u201d did mean to \u201cimmerse.\u201d By the time the New Testament was written, that word described the application of water that included immersing, washing and pouring. This illustrates how the etymology and initial usage of a word is one thing, but current usage is another matter. (Consider how the same thing is true regarding English words.)\nWhen the New Testament writers used the word \u201cbaptizo,\u201d they were not using it in a way that always reflected its original meaning. Those writers used \u201cbaptizo\u201d to describe the washing of hands (Mark 7:3; Luke 11:38) and kitchen utensils and furniture (Mark 7:4). When people claim that the word \u201cbaptizo\u201d in the Greek New Testament always means \u201cto immerse,\u201d they are ignoring the other meanings of that word in context.\nMany of those same people claim that the baptisms of Jesus and the Ethiopian eunuch prove the necessity of baptism by immersion. That claim is completely groundless. Matthew tells us that after Jesus was baptized, \u201che went up out of the water\u201d (Matthew 3:16). Matthew does not tell us how far Jesus went into the water. He omits that information because it is not important. In the case of the Ethiopian eunuch we are told that \u201che went down into the water\u201d (Acts 8:38) to be baptized and \u201ccame up out of the water\u201d (Acts 8:39) after he was baptized. Luke does not tell us how far the eunuch went into the water. He omits that information because it is not important.\nWhen Jesus gave the great commission, which included baptizing, he did not specify how water was to be applied to people. If the Lord really wanted Baptism to be done by immersion and immersion only, he could have used another Greek word \u2013 \u201cbapto.\u201d That word means \u201cto dip\u201d or \u201cdip in something.\u201d He did not use that word.\nIn your outreach work, do go beyond conversations with people about how water is applied in Baptism. Share the Bible\u2019s teaching that Baptism is a means through which the Holy Spirit works to connect people to Jesus in saving faith (Titus 3:5-7; 1 Peter 3:20-21). God bless your efforts!"}

The sinful nature is present when a person\u2019s life begins. As the person\u2019s abilities develop, so do the capabilities of sinning. Some sins might be visible to us; we might not be aware of other sins.\nRomans 9:11-13 describes God reversing the birthright blessing, giving it to Jacob instead of Esau. Instead of the older brother receiving that blessing, the younger would receive it.

Is applause given selectively or consistently for people\u2019s participation in worship services? (Applause for singing but not preaching?) What is the purpose of applause in secular settings in our society? How does applause given in performance settings relate to applause in worship settings? Does applause fit with Christ-centered worship or detract from it? How can 1 Corinthians 10:31 (\u201cSo whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.\u201d) apply to your situation?\nUndoubtedly, there are many more questions that can be considered, but these can get you started. I pray that your congregation can work through this issue in Christian love and selflessness."}
{"prompt": "ELDoNA and WELS", "completion": "What is the difference between the ELDoNA and WELS?\n\n\nELDoNA stands for \u201cEvangelical Lutheran Diocese of North America.\u201d Information from ELDoNA\u2019s website explains a difference in organizational structure from WELS: \u201cA \u2018diocese\u2019 is simply an area of administration\u2026Such an area of \u2018administration\u2019 is overseen by an \u2018administrator,\u2019 which we, following the received tradition of the Church throughout the ages, refer to as \u2018Superintendent\u2019 or \u2018Bishop.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cStrictly-speaking, only clergy are members of the diocese; a congregation served by a pastor of our diocese remains \u2018independent\u2019 of any ecclesiastical structure, and is directly under the spiritual leadership of the pastor whom the Lord has called to serve in that place. We do require that a congregation which is served by a pastor of our diocese does not itself hold membership in a \u2018synod\u2019 which is not in fellowship with the ELDoNA.\u201d\nThere are currently eighteen pastors who belong to the diocese.\nDoctrinal differences between ELDoNA and WELS would be especially in the areas of justification, and church and ministry."}
{"prompt": "Honoraria for pastors", "completion": "What is a customary gift ($) for a church and or pastor for performing a wedding, baptism, funeral, etc.?\n\n\nThat is entirely up to the people who receive those services of a pastor. As a parish pastor, I was happy to tell people that the congregation called me to perform services like these and honoraria were not necessary. Much more often than not, the individuals still wanted to express their appreciation for my time and effort and so gave a gift of their choosing. It was also my experience that some funeral directors provided guidance to families regarding an honorarium they could give their pastor.\nSo, it is entirely up to people what they would like to do when they receive personalized service from their pastor. Pastors are happy to serve."}
{"prompt": "Christian or atheist", "completion": "Is it better to be a Christian sinner or a righteous atheist?  I heard a Catholic say it is better to be a righteous atheist.\n\n\nChristians are sinners who, through faith in Jesus Christ, enjoy forgiveness of sins. Atheists are people who cannot do anything righteous in God\u2019s sight or pleasing to him (John 15:5; Hebrews 11:6).\nJesus\u2019 words in Mark 16:16 (\u201cWhoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.\u201d) answer your question very clearly."}
{"prompt": "WELS and ELS", "completion": "I understand that we are in fellowship with the ELS, but are there any doctrinal differences between the WELS and ELS at all?\n\n\nThe fact that WELS is in fellowship with ELS means that there is doctrinal agreement between the two synods.\nWhat you will find with the two synods is differences in practice\u2014particularly in the corporate worship life of the synods\u2019 congregations. There can be more chanting of the liturgy by ELS pastors. In addition, the hymnal of the ELS provides for congregational singing of the Lord\u2019s Prayer and the kneeling of the pastor on a prayer bench. Any other differences might be explained by the historical development of both synods. The historical background of WELS is Germanic, while that of ELS is Norwegian.\nAs is the case with other churches in the Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference, we treasure our fellowship with the Evangelical Lutheran Synod."}
{"prompt": "Entertainment and Christians", "completion": "How can I explain to my teenage son that watching movies like \"The Dark Knight\" is not God-pleasing or that he should avoid and turn away from watching movies with sex or bad language and violence.  He just watches them and thinks it's okay--he thinks nothing is wrong with watching a movie for entertainment.  It is corrupting your mind and can lead to thinking it's okay - can't it?\n\n\nWatching a movie for entertainment is fine, but \u201centertainment\u201d does not make objectionable content acceptable. Your concern for your son\u2019s welfare is good and commendable.\nYou can explain to your son that sexual themes in movies can do much to degrade women, glamorize adultery and desensitize Christians to sexual sins. What may appear to be mere entertainment can definitely adversely affect a person\u2019s thoughts and words and actions.\nYou can remind your son that the wrong kind of entertainment can fuel sins against the sixth commandment. Jesus said, \u201cYou have heard that it was said, \u2018You shall not commit adultery.\u2019 But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart\u201d (Matthew 5:27-28).\nSimilarly, being exposed to crude and vulgar language in entertainment can have an effect on Christians and the way they talk. God gives this directive: \u201cNor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving\u201d (Ephesians 5:4).\nRecognizing that the images and sounds that reach our minds can affect us, it is no surprise that the Bible gives this instruction: \u201cFinally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable\u2014if anything is excellent or praiseworthy\u2014think about such things\u201d (Philippians 4:8). It would be helpful for Christians of all ages to ask themselves if the entertainment they are engaged in passes the \u201cPhilippians test.\u201d\nGod bless you and your family as you seek to be salt and lights to others around you (Matthew 5:13-16)."}
{"prompt": "No condemnation", "completion": "Does God punish us?\n\n\nNo. \u201cTherefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus\u201d (Romans 8:1). God has already punished Jesus his Son for our sins (Isaiah 53:4-8). Through Spirit-worked faith in Jesus, we are spared the punishment our sins deserved (Psalm 103:10).\nAs God interacts in the lives of Christians, the language of the Bible is \u201cdiscipline\u201d not \u201cpunishment\u201d (Hebrews 12:1-13). The motive behind discipline is love not anger.\nWhen you and I face difficulties or challenges or disappointments in life, they are not punishments from God. Romans 8:1 explains that God does not condemn Christians now, nor will he condemn them in the future. No condemnation, no punishment\u2014that is God\u2019s gracious treatment of his children.\nThose whose earthly lives end in unbelief, rejecting God, will receive punishment from God (Matthew 22:13; Mark 16:16; 2 Thessalonians 1:6-10)."}
{"prompt": "Health and God's love", "completion": "I have been suffering from a deteriorating disease. I feel this illness is taking away my faith in God. I cannot live with the guilt this has caused. I desperately call out to him and love him so much. Please, how can I strengthen my faith in God during this time? I feel like he does not love me. \n\n\nI am sorry to hear about your health situation. Be assured that our physical health can be quite different from our spiritual health. Struggles in life, including diseases, do not mean that God\u2019s love has diminished. The Bible\u2019s promise to Christians is that nothing can separate them from God\u2019s love in Christ: \u201cFor I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord\u201d (Romans 8:38-39). Sickness and disease are among those items that cannot separate us from God\u2019s love in Christ.\nSatan would love for us to conclude that problems in life are signs that God does not love us. Satan is a liar (John 8:44). As we tune out Satan\u2019s voice, we want to listen to the voice of our God in Scripture. God always speaks the truth (Numbers 23:19).\nConsider some of the things God says to you in his word: \u201cThough the mountains be shaken and the hills be removed, yet my unfailing love for you will not be shaken nor my covenant of peace be removed,\u201d says the LORD, who has compassion on you\u201d (Isaiah 54:10). Your God assures you: \u201cI have loved you with an everlasting love\u201d (Jeremiah 31:3). God promises you: \u201cNever will I leave you; never will I forsake you\u201d (Hebrews 13:5).\nTo strengthen your faith at this time and throughout life, continue to go to the means the Holy Spirit uses to deepen and nurture our faith: the gospel in word and sacraments. Remember your Baptism. Recognize that in Baptism God made you his own dear child. Read the Bible and other devotional materials you might have. Be a frequent guest at the Lord\u2019s Supper. Through these means, God assures you of his forgiving, unending love.\nFinally, speak to your pastor or other trusted Christian friend about your situation in life. God bless you!"}
{"prompt": "Calvinism", "completion": "What are the differences in Calvinism and Lutheran teachings?  My brother recently sent me a video from Truth or Tradition that speaks of how Christmas and Easter are based more on devil worship.  And now he is stating that he will not go to any church unless it will not participate in either Christmas or Easter celebration.  Early in the video John Calvin is quoted.  I see that Calvinism teaches 5 principles: T.U.L.I.P.  T: total depravity, U: unconditional election, L: limited atonement, I: irresistible grace, and P: perseverance of the Saints.  I am particularly interested in unconditional election as several Scripture verses quote that God has chosen or predestined a few to be saved and not others.  What Scripture verses refute these teachings?\n\n\nThis month\u2019s \u201cLight for our path\u201d column addresses the concern about Easter celebrations. This link will take you to that column.\nThe Bible does not teach double predestination; it teaches an election to salvation only (Ephesians 1:3-14). From the Bible we learn that God wants all people to be saved (1 Timothy 2:4; 2 Peter 3:9). We learn from Scripture that people are responsible for their damnation (Jeremiah 15:6; Hosea 13:9; Matthew 23:37). The over-emphasis on human reason in Calvinism leads to the false teaching of double predestination.\nAnother very important difference is that Calvinism denies the power of God in the sacraments (Baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper) and considers them only \u201cordinances.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Teachers and licensure", "completion": "Why does WELS not require their teachers (K-12) to have their state teaching licenses? Also, why does WELS call teachers for positions where their degree qualifications do not line up (for example, a teacher with a degree in physical education teaching science)?\n\n\nMartin Luther College (MLC), where I presently serve, states this on its website: \u201cStudents who successfully complete program requirements and meet the Minnesota requirements for licensure are eligible for a Minnesota license. To ensure that all teacher graduates are assignable anywhere in our country, MLC requires all teacher graduates to be eligible for a Tier 3 Minnesota license.\u201d\nOnce MLC graduates receive their assignments, even though they have their Minnesota license, the state to which they are called may ask the graduates to also be licensed in that particular state.\nIn addition, Martin Luther College conducts a Post-Baccalaureate Licensure Program to work with teachers who graduated from Dr. Martin Luther College or Martin Luther College before 2002 \u201cto be eligible for their initial Minnesota teaching license or add-on to an existing Minnesota license\u201d (MLC Website).\nSchools that extend calls for specific teaching responsibilities might consider the gifts, abilities and teaching experiences of individuals, along with their degree qualifications. It can also happen that a school is not able to find a \u201cspecialist\u201d at a time a position needs to be filled and a person with other qualifications is called. As a recent answer explained: \u201cEven though the Call is divine and from God, our process is a human one. That means that, while we try to do the best we can, the process itself might not always work as we intend it to work.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "LCMS seminaries", "completion": "I just saw a video from a WELS pastor claiming the LCMS seminaries teach doctrine is not important. My entire experience says this is blatantly false. Agree?\n\n\nI am not aware of which video you are referencing. I would agree with your assessment."}
{"prompt": "Reading materials", "completion": "How do I stop thinking like a legalist?  I have been reading a lot of Baptist materials lately, and always seem to think like a legalist.\n\n\nYou do recognize that what you read affects your thought process. With that in mind, the answer to your question amounts to changing your reading material.\nLegalism shows itself in different ways: trying to accomplish what only the gospel can, labeling things \u201csinful\u201d when God has not done so and using the gospel as a club to change behavior.\nIn addition to reading the Bible, I encourage you to use materials that do not confuse law and gospel. For starters, you can consider reading Forward in Christ, our monthly magazine. God bless your reading!"}
{"prompt": "Faith and salvation", "completion": "I have a question on salvation. The Bible clearly says that that we are saved by grace, not by works (Ephesians 2:8-9). But isn\u2019t belief itself a work? Isn\u2019t believing something we have to do to be saved? This is connected to another question that I have: what is the least someone has to do to get to heaven? Where is the line drawn? Is it trust in God? Is it repentance? How much trust or repentance is needed to be saved? Thanks for any answers.\r\n\n\n\nChristian faith is necessary for salvation (Mark 16:16). Faith is a work, but it is God\u2019s work (1 Corinthians 6:11; 12:3; 2 Thessalonians 2:13-14; 2 Timothy 1:9). In the Scripture verses you cited, we learn that faith is God\u2019s gift to people (Ephesians 2:8).\nSaving faith is characterized by trust and reliance on Christ alone for salvation. Christian faith saves not because of the strength of faith on the part of the Christian, but because of the object of faith: Jesus Christ. Salvation is not a matter of having a certain level of faith. Christian faith, even the weakest of faith, saves. That is true because the object of faith is Jesus Christ, and Jesus did everything to live up to his name, which means \u201cSavior.\u201d\nI hope this response is helpful for you."}
{"prompt": "Help for pornography", "completion": "I often give in to the sin of watching porn and feel bad and pray to God apologizing and get Communion, then end up falling into temptation again and repeating.

I want to stop and feel super bad if I don't take Communion, but know I will sooner or later fall back into my old ways. What should I do? I don't feel right talking to my pastor about it either.\n\n\nIf you do not feel that you can talk to your pastor about this, I would encourage you to check out the resources, including counselors, available through Conquerors Through Christ, an agency within WELS.

{"prompt": "Crown of thorns", "completion": "Watching some of the coverage of the Notre Dame Cathedral fire, I have heard that there is a crown of thorns there that they believe to be the crown worn by Jesus on the cross.  I have never heard of this before.  Could this be possible?  Does our WELS have an opinion as to whether this could be the actual crown of thorns worn by Jesus?\n\n\nOur church body does not an official opinion on this. I can offer only a personal observation. It is only church legend that the crown of thorns is authentic. Historical documentation for the relic is weak. In addition, more than twenty churches throughout the world claim to have some fragments of Jesus\u2019 crown of thorns.\nAs Christians, we do not need artifacts that correspond with events in the Bible. God\u2019s record of events in the Bible is sufficient. Christian faith needs no visible proof (John 20:29; Hebrews 11:1)."}

{"prompt": "Reasons for worship", "completion": "I have a relative who stopped going to Church (Baptist) and feels she does not have to go to church to be a Christian. I asked her about Communion and she said if she prays God will forgive her sins.  What should I say to her?\n\n\nThe Bible certainly instructs Christians to assemble in God\u2019s house and worship him. \u201cAnd let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another\u2014and all the more as you see the Day approaching\u201d (Hebrews 10:24-25). One of the blessings of corporate worship, as the Hebrews passage indicates, is mutual encouragement. Your presence at worship services is an encouragement to others, while you receive encouragement from the presence of fellow believers.\nOther blessings of corporate worship, to name a few, are: hearing the good news from a fellow believer that our sins are forgiven through Jesus Christ, listening to Scripture read and explained and applied to life, receiving the Lord\u2019s Supper, joining our hearts and voices with fellow Christians in song and prayer, and giving back to God the money he has entrusted to us, for the worldwide work of the church. Corporate worship is a way of carrying out the Lord\u2019s instruction: \u201cLet the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts\u201d (Colossians 3:16). When we realize what blessings there are in corporate worship, the psalmist\u2019s attitude becomes ours: \u201cI rejoiced with those who said to me: \u2018Let us go to the house of the LORD\u2019\u201d (Psalm 122:1)\nFinally, you can pass along to your relative that prayer is not a means of grace.

Those who are guilty of such behavior in our schools need to be called to repentance.

{"prompt": "Special needs child", "completion": "I was baptized, and confirmed in WELS and had attended my local WELS church.  Six years ago, my husband and I became foster parents to our great niece and eventually adopted her.  She is now 8 1/2 years old and has multiple diagnoses.  She has Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, Tourette Syndrome, ADHD, and OCD.  Sensory Processing Disorder is also part of Tourette\u2019s.  The church I attended didn\u2019t seem to grasp that she had special needs, and made things difficult for us to be there.  I requested a release of membership and, after attending a local Baptist church for a few months, started watching live streams of a WELS church 40 miles away that we attend once a month.  My daughter\u2019s needs don\u2019t seem to be such a huge thing for that congregation.  My question is, what is your stance on special needs kids and their families?  Do you offer accommodations for them or are the kids expected to just deal?  I think leaders in the church ought to have education in supporting special needs families and including them.  I don\u2019t feel that WELS is all that accepting of them.  This needs to change in my opinion.  After all, Jesus loves all people.  Shouldn\u2019t WELS?\n\n\nI am sorry to hear about your experiences. As a church body, we certainly do try to minister to special needs children and their families. Perhaps the most help I can offer is making you (more) aware of WELS Commission on Special Ministries.

In addition, you might be in a position someday to alert one of our congregations to these resources.\nJohn 3:16 certainly states the boundless love of God. As Christians united in faith, we strive to display that same love to others. Because of sin, we all fall short in doing that. With believing and repentant hearts we seek God\u2019s forgiveness. Renewed and refreshed by his forgiving love, we seek to grow in our love to God and others. God bless you and your family."}
{"prompt": "Martial arts", "completion": "We are WELS Lutherans and have raised our children as such. When our son was a child, I took a karate class with him. I found that it helped with his self-confidence and I even saw an increase in obedience.  As a young adult, he is interested in taking karate again, and I feel that it would help him as it did when he was a child. I have read that some Christians stay away from the martial arts due to a mixing on Eastern philosophy/mysticism/Buddhism. I didn't pick up on any of that when we took the class when he was a youngster. I realize there is a large variation on how much of those undesirable aspects would creep in, depending on what kind of martial arts and the philosophy of the instructor. What is our church's stance on the martial arts?\n\n\nThere is no official stance to which I can point you. From what I read on the subject, I would agree with your assessment.

{"prompt": "Baptism and faith", "completion": "Do Lutherans believe that every single person baptized is automatically regenerated (even if they can lost their salvation after)?\n\n\nWe do not teach an irresistible grace or an irresistible working of the Holy Spirit through the gospel in word and sacrament. It is possible to resist God\u2019s grace in the gospel (Acts 7:51).\nPeople can lose their faith after being brought to faith through Baptism (Luke 8:13; 1 Corinthians 10:12; Galatians 5:4; 1 Timothy 1:19-20; 2 Peter 3:17).\nIf you are interested in learning more what we believe about Baptism, here are some statements from This We Believe, a statement of belief of our church body:\n\u201c3. We believe that also through the Sacrament of Baptism the Holy Spirit applies the gospel to sinners, giving them new life (Titus 3:5) and cleansing them from all sin (Acts 2:38). The Lord points to the blessing of Baptism when he promises, \u2018Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved\u2019 (Mark 16:16). We believe that the blessing of Baptism is meant for all people (Matthew 28:19), including infants. Infants are born sinful (John 3:6) and therefore need to be born again, that is, to be brought to faith, through Baptism (John 3:5).\n\u201c5. We believe that the Lord gave his Word and the sacraments of Baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper for a purpose. He commanded his followers, \u2018Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you\u2019 (Matthew 28:19,20). Through God\u2019s Word and sacraments he preserves and extends the holy Christian church throughout the world. Believers should therefore be diligent and faithful in the use of these divinely established means of grace for themselves and in their mission outreach to others. These are the only means through which immortal souls are brought to faith and to life in heaven.\n\u201c7. We reject the view that babies should not be baptized and that they cannot believe in Christ (Luke 18:15-17). We reject the view that baptism must be by immersion.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Infant and adult Baptism", "completion": "I am a WELS member and understand that we are meant to baptize \"all nations,\" which includes infants among adults. I read that the LCMS requires that parents not outright reject raising an infant in the faith.  Does WELS hold a similar belief? I am also wondering about the reasoning for instructing adults before baptizing adults.  I understand there are examples in the Bible where adults are taught and then baptized, however, why doesn't a similar rule apply to infants? I understand that they can believe, however, isn't one point of infant baptism to bring infants to faith or strengthen it through the work of the Holy Spirit? Is it simply a matter of different instructions from God for baptizing infants vs. adults? \n\n\nWe certainly want our parents to recognize their responsibilities in having their children baptized and bringing them up \u201cin the training and instruction of the Lord\u201d (Ephesians 6:4).\nWe baptize infants and children because they are included in the Lord\u2019s command to baptize \u201call nations\u201d (Matthew 28:19-20), they have a need for forgiveness (Psalm 51:5) and they can believe through the power of the Holy Spirit (Matthew 18:6; Luke 18:15-17). After baptizing children, we instruct them in the word of God. Through that instruction, the Holy Spirit strengthens their faith.\nIn the case of adults, the Bible provides an example in Acts chapter 8 in offering instruction to adults before baptizing. In addition, through baptism an adult becomes a member not only of the Christian Church but also the local congregation. That means that the adult who wants to be baptized needs to understand not only what baptism is and offers, but also be acquainted with the public confession of the congregation based on God\u2019s Word."}

Recently my cousin\u2019s church told her and her boyfriend that they wouldn\u2019t baptize their child because the parents were living together. Two years went by and the church didn\u2019t reach out until now when they said it would be a sin to have the child baptized elsewhere, and they asked my cousin if she would like to be released from the church. Why wouldn\u2019t the church take the opportunity to encourage them to go to church, repent of their sins and have personal devotions with them vs. making them feel like the biggest sinners there are? Isn\u2019t every sin equal? Are we going to start turning away all sinners who don\u2019t repent right away? I just want to know why WELS churches are not using these opportunities to bring people to repentance and closer to God.  \n\n\nThe only information I possess about this situation is what you have shared. I am not privy to more complete information on how the congregation and its leaders might have addressed the situation you described. Perhaps there is more information\u2014confidential information\u2014than you or I have.\nWhen it comes to addressing sin in the lives of church members, our pastors will seek to call them to repentance through the law, and also assure penitent sinners of the gospel\u2019s message of forgiveness. Fruits of repentance (Luke 3:8) can also be a topic of discussion between church members and their pastors.\nWhen it comes to sin, your words do recognize that before God sinful thoughts are as serious as sinful deeds (Matthew 5:28; 1 John 3:15).\nSin is serious. Impenitence is serious. Because of that, pastors and church leaders will speak to church members about sin. What happens in people\u2019s hearts and lives after that is beyond the control of pastors and church leaders. What pastors and church leaders can do is maintain contact with people, continue to share God\u2019s word with them and pray that God changes their hearts. I join you in praying for a peaceful resolution to the situation you described."}
{"prompt": "Comforting a friend", "completion": "How would you comfort a member who confessed to having an abortion before she came to faith? She feels that she is responsible for sending her child to hell.\n\n\nScripture is silent on the eternal outcome of babies who die through abortion. We can tell others what the Bible says about sin, faith and forgiveness, but we cannot speak for God in matters God himself has not spoken in the Bible.\nSin is serious and, as your friend has confessed her sin, you want to share the comforting message of the gospel of Jesus Christ with her. \u201cThe blood of Jesus, [God\u2019s] Son, purifies us from all sins\u201d (1 John 1:7). \u201cThough your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool\u201d (Isaiah 1:18).\nYou can tell your friend that we cannot undo our sinful past, but then you can assure your friend that with God there is no sinful past. God says, \u201cFor I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more\u201d (Hebrews 8:12). Your friend may never be able to forget what she has done, but God forgives and forgets. And if God has forgiven us, we can and need to forgive ourselves.\nI would encourage you to direct your friend to the resources of Christian Life Resources. This link will take you to the website\u2019s \u201cPost-Abortion\u201d section, where there are good articles you and your friend can read.\nBe a good listener to your friend.

{"prompt": "Congregations and Choice dollars", "completion": "What is the WELS position on organizations and congregations accepting Choice Dollars from Thrivent Financial? This question was partially addressed in Q&As from 2014, and a restatement of the answer again in 2018.  The gist of the reply was, \"Members will need to make their own decision as to whether or not they continue to direct their Choice dollars to organizations. Congregations, schools, and organizations, while not compelled to refuse Choice dollars, are encouraged to consider carefully whether or not the Thrivent name should be publicly promoted in congregational or organizational literature.\u201d  This issue has become contentious within our congregation and may lead to a serious divide. The issue is due to be brought up at an upcoming Voter's Meeting. Our pastor sees the merits of both sides of this argument and stated that he sought further guidance from the Synod. Please provide a current answer to this question, rather than another restatement of a 5 year old answer.\r\nWhile it appears that WELS itself doesn't accept Thrivent money, it appears that many WELS organizations do, and publicly acknowledge it.  1 Corinthians 8 comes to mind in this matter.  Is this a parallel to the Thrivent issue?\r\n\n\n\nBecause circumstances have not changed, this response will largely be another restatement of answers already available on this website. Perhaps, in response to your question, I can emphasize the \u201cconsider carefully\u201d phrase of previous responses.\nCareful consideration of the issue will take into account principles outlined in 1 Corinthians 8 and Romans 14. Among those principles is thinking of fellow Christians and being ready to withhold action out of consideration for them. If there are congregational members whose Christian judgment leads them to object to Choice dollars, the congregation and its leaders will want to deal with those concerns evangelically and lovingly. It could very well be the case that a congregation would decline such funds if the issue becomes a source of division or controversy.\nRomans 14:17-20 (\u201cFor the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit, because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and receives human approval. Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification. Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food.\u201d) puts matters of Christian judgment in perspective and encourages Christians to do what they can to maintain peaceful relations with one another and build each other up in the faith. May God lead you all to a peaceful resolution of the issue."}
{"prompt": "Killjoy", "completion": "Is God a killjoy?  I have been reading a lot of Baptist materials and they all seem to describe God as a killjoy.  I am very puzzled because Ecclesiastes 8:15 seems to suggest otherwise.\n\n\nGod desires people\u2019s happiness and God truly knows what can give people happiness and lasting joy.\nPeople might think that God is a killjoy by giving his laws and commandments. Nothing could be further from the truth. The way in which God prefaced the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:1-2) demonstrated his grace and love for his covenant people of Israel. God\u2019s laws are not restrictions on having a good time in life or barriers for personal freedom. Quite the opposite, sin is what enslaves people (John 8:34), and Christians find freedom in doing what God says (James 1:25).\nOf course, the chief purpose of the law is to show us our sins and point out our need for a Savior. The gospel shows us the perfect Savior we have in Jesus Christ, through whom there is forgiveness of sins and eternal life. To Christians, the gospel message is a source of unending joy.\nThe passage you cited does describe Solomon\u2019s observation that we can enjoy God\u2019s gift of life by appreciating all his gifts to us.\nI would encourage you to change your reading material. Beyond reading the Bible, of course, Forward in Christ\u00a0offers good, solid reading material about the Christian faith and the Christian life."}
{"prompt": "God's attitudes towards sinners", "completion": "My friend and I are both WELS, but he strongly believes that God hates us, which I disagree with. His argument is that God hates sin, and we are sin, so therefore God hates us to the core of our being. I pointed out John 3:16 to him but he said the context  of the passage means it's talking about something else. I am somewhat unsure now because I don't have the complete biblical knowledge to disprove his point. Does God actually hate us? And how do I talk to my friend about this issue? \n\n\nThe message of the law is that God hates sinners (Psalm 5:5). The message of the gospel is that God loves sinners (Romans 5:8). These are not contradictory messages; they are different messages. We see the intersection of those messages at the cross of Calvary. There God punished Jesus in the place of all sinners, sparing them the punishment they deserved (2 Corinthians 5:21; 1 John 4:10).\nAs Christians, we stand in grace (Romans 5:2) and enjoy God\u2019s forgiving love. The message of God\u2019s law regarding sinners serves as a warning for Christians not to reject salvation by impenitence and unbelief.\nPerhaps you and your friend could benefit from Law and Gospel: Bad News\u2014Good News. The book explains very thoroughly the different messages of the law and gospel. It is available from Northwestern Publishing House."}
{"prompt": "Church and outside organizations", "completion": "What would Jesus do here? \r\nShould our church receive monies from an outside organization that requires by their agreement that our church to publicly acknowledge these monies for the purpose of advertising for the outside business and requires our churches agreement to participate and our church members to subscribe to a confession of faith that is in conflict with our church doctrine? \n\n\nA response to a question very similar to yours was published on the website earlier this week.

{"prompt": "Subscribing to the Lutheran Confessions", "completion": "The confessions speak of Mary as Semper Virgo (always-virgin) in the Smalcald Articles [24]. What defense do we have of this? Can I be a called worker if I don't agree with this portion of the Book of Concord?\n\n\nYour question is one that numerous people over the years have asked. Below is a good response from an essay titled \u201cWhy Bible-Believing Lutherans Subscribe to the Book of Concord.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026critics of the confessions often raise the charge that the confessions teach the perpetual virginity of Mary in Article I, IV of the Smalcald Articles. First of all, it should be noted that Article I, IV is not about Mary. It is about the two natures of Christ.\n\u201cThe Latin refers to Mary as pure, holy, and always-virgin. It is noteworthy that the German simply refers to the pure, holy Virgin Mary. If the confession was concerned to assert perpetual virginity for Mary, the author of the German version bungled the job totally because no reference to always-virgin appears in the German. It seems that the Latin sempervirgine was simply a stock phrase for describing the virginity of Mary. The article is not concerned to make any assertion about Mary beyond the fact that she bore a child without any participation by a human father.\n\u201cScripture makes no assertion that Jesus was born without the normal physical effects of childbirth on the body of his mother. It makes no assertion that Mary remained virgin after the birth of Jesus. Already in the ancient church there were three theories about Jesus\u2019 brothers and sisters who are mentioned in the gospels. One theory is that these were actually Jesus\u2019 cousins. Another is that these were children of Joseph, whose first wife had died before he married Mary. Both of these theories were motivated at least in part by the desire to preserve Mary\u2019s virginity even after Christ\u2019s birth. There is no direct evidence to support them in Scripture. The third idea is that these \u2018brothers\u2019 were children of Mary and Joseph born in a natural way after Christ\u2019s birth. This third view is the most natural understanding of the passages in which Jesus, Mary, and these brothers and sisters appear together. See, for example, Matthew 12:46 and 13:55. Luther and many of his contemporaries seem to have retained the opinion that Mary had no other children besides Jesus, but most recent Lutheran theologians lean toward the third view. In the quotation from his \u2018Large Confession concerning the Holy Supper\u2019 which is cited in FC, TD, VII, Luther refers to the belief that Mary bore Jesus \u2018with a closed womb\u2019 as a possibility believed by some. Pieper treats both matters as open questions (III, p. 307-309). Our subscription to the confessions makes no assertion about the duration of the virginity of Mary because neither Scripture nor the confessions make any such assertion.\u201d [Why Bible-Believing Lutherans Subscribe to the Book of Concord, pages 7-8]\nI hope this explanation eliminates your concerns, making future ordination/installation vows\u2014God willing\u2014possible."}
{"prompt": "Faith alone", "completion": "I have been WELS all of my life, raised, baptized, confirmed, and have been to many WELS churches and attending multiple schools.  I have been taught so many times that faith alone saves.  Why do we say faith alone if we also seem to say that faith and repentance saves?  Is it faith alone?  Or is it faith and repentance?  And let's throw in baptism, too, while we are at it.  Is it faith alone or not?\n\n\nIt is faith alone (Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:5-6).\nIt is helpful to keep in mind that the Bible uses \u201crepentance\u201d in a narrower and wider sense. When the Bible combines \u201crepentance\u201d and \u201cfaith\u201d (for example, Acts 20:21), then \u201crepentance\u201d means \u201ccontrition, sorrow over sin.\u201d That is the narrower sense of repentance.\nThe wider sense of repentance is a meaning that combines \u201csorrow over sin\u201d and \u201cfaith.\u201d You can see examples of this wider sense of repentance in Luke 13:3-5 and Luke 15:7.\nWhat about baptism, you ask? The Bible teaches that baptism saves (1 Peter 3:21). That claim about baptism can be made when we keep in mind that the Holy Spirit can work through baptism to connect people to Jesus Christ in saving faith. In the end, it is the faith that baptism creates that saves. Faith alone\u2014not works\u2014saves.\nI hope this helps clarify matters for you."}
{"prompt": "End-of-life experiences", "completion": "I just read the question and answer about ghosts.  I came to same conclusion that paranormal experiences are the Devil and his demons doing his work.  Now, many years later I am an experienced hospice social worker.  I have heard and seen experiences that my patients are having when they are getting closer to dying.  They often talk about or even talk to the unseen.  Often times, they are even able to clearly identify them as a familiar, deceased loved one, often their mother.  So, if we are supposed to believe that any paranormal activity is from the Devil, why are my patients having good experiences of seeing their loved ones before they die?  When other family members see this, this usually only strengthens their faith and gives them comfort as they believe it is a deceased family member seemingly getting ready to welcome a person to heaven as their life on earth comes to a close.  Why would the Devil allow such paranormal activities to happen if faith in the Lord is only strengthened?   \n\n\nYour question shifts the focus of attention from ghosts (which a previous answer addressed) to end-of-life experiences. What might explain such experiences? It is possible that people \u201csee\u201d what they desire to see. In other instances, medications can affect the mind. We cannot rule out that Satan, who \u201cmasquerades as an angel of light\u201d (2 Corinthians 11:14), can seek to deceive people even at the end of life. Supporting that thought is the fact that there are accounts of non-Christians reporting experiences of \u201cheavenly welcomes\u201d in their last moments of earthly life.\nThrough the work of the Holy Spirit, a Christian like Stephen did see a glorious vision of heaven before he was stoned to death (Acts 7:54-56).\u00a0 God can certainly do the same thing today if he wants to, but we have no promise from God that Christians will have heavenly visions before death.\nWhat we do have is God\u2019s sure promise that those who believe in Jesus Christ as their Savior \u201cwill live, even though they die\u201d (John 11:25). We do well to compare the experiences people report at death\u2019s threshold with the word of God."}
{"prompt": "Entertainment choices", "completion": "If I enjoy watching TV and movies that contain sinful ideas (sex scenes, drug and alcohol use, violence, etc.), am I also sinning?  Should I be repenting for watching and being entertained by this? \n\n\nRepentance is called for when we think of our natural sinful condition and when we sin in thought, word or deed. Repentance is called for when \u201centertainment\u201d leads us to lustful thoughts (Matthew 5:28).\nWhat we read, watch and listen to does have a positive or negative effect on us. So, when it comes to entertainment choices, we all do well to follow this instruction: \u201cFinally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable\u2014if anything is excellent or praiseworthy\u2014think about such things\u201d (Philippians 4:8)."}
{"prompt": "Glorified bodies", "completion": "On the mount of transfiguration did Moses and Elijah have glorified bodies? Elijah went to heaven without dying, but Moses died (Deuteronomy 34:5-6).  Also in 1 Corinthians 15:22-23 we are told those who belong to Christ will be raised when he comes again. Can you please shed some light on this? \n\n\nIn his account of the transfiguration, the evangelist Luke tells us that Moses and Elijah \u201cappeared in glorious splendor\u201d (Luke 9:31). Those men appeared to Peter, James and John with bodies that reflected the heavenly glory they were enjoying.\n1 Corinthians 15:22-23 does speak of Jesus\u2019 resurrection and the resurrection of Christians. Verse 23 speaks of \u201cChrist, the firstfruits.\u201d Although other people in the Old and New Testament had been raised from the dead (but then experienced death a second time), Jesus was the first person to die, rise from the dead and never die again. Christians who die will rise on the Last Day and never die again\u2014just like Jesus.\nJohn 5:28-29 is one of those sections in the Bible that teaches that on the Last Day God will raise all the dead: Christians and unbelievers. He will reunite bodies with souls (and glorify the bodies of Christians \u2013 1 Corinthians 15:35-57). All those people, along with the people who are alive on earth at Jesus\u2019 visible return on the Last Day, will face judgment (Matthew 25:31-48). Unbelievers, body and soul, will experience the horrors of hell forever. Christians, body and soul, will enjoy a perfect and glorious life with God on the new heaven and new earth."}
{"prompt": "Prayer and health", "completion": "I am having a hard time grappling with the healing stories in Scripture.  Jesus and the apostles healed people physically, mentally, spiritually, in every way.  There are numerous passages and we are expected to accept them at face value.  We also read in John 16:24 and many other passages that we are to ask in Jesus' name and we will receive.\r\n\r\nMy disabled adult son almost died three years ago from a severe heart infection.  In fact, he was under hospice care for three weeks until he started to get better, without any real treatment.  Many people were praying for him.  People in our church were calling it a miracle.  He was put on a minor heart failure drug and for several months evidently had no problems.   Then we came to learn he had advanced kidney disease, and he requires catheterization four times a day, which severely limits his ability to travel or do anything in a \"normal\" way.  He has had numerous urinary tract infections since then. His life has drastically changed, as has ours. My wife and I are getting on in years and are very fearful for his future. \r\n\r\nI feel like the \"miracle\" was a joke, as now, he is sicker and more disabled than he ever was before the heart problem.  I've been praying for his physical healing, also for wisdom to know God's will for him.  I am getting nothing.  Can you help?\r\n \n\n\nYou are correct in noting that the healing miracles in the Bible are true; they did take place. Then, again, what we need to keep in mind is that all those people on the receiving end of God\u2019s miraculous power experienced death (and those who were raised from the dead experienced death a second time). Their physical healing was not permanent. Was there sickness or prolonged sickness before death took place? We are not told.\nTo all the Bible passages that speak of God\u2019s promise to answer prayers, we need to add other Bible passages that speak of God\u2019s love and wisdom that go beyond our understanding (Isaiah 55:8-9; Romans 11:33-36). God\u2019s wisdom and love may lead him to answer our prayers in ways that differ from our requests (2 Corinthians 12:7-10), but we recognize that God always has our best\u2014our eternal best\u2014in mind (Romans 8:28).\nI encourage you to continue to pray for your son, yourself and your family. Then, be sure to give the Lord plenty of opportunities to speak to you through his word (Colossians 3:16). Remember the meaning of baptism: that God has made you his own dear child. (The same is true for your son.) Be a frequent guest at the Lord\u2019s Supper to receive in the most personal way possible the forgiveness of sins. Satan would like nothing more than for you to question and doubt God\u2019s love. Using God\u2019s gospel in word and sacrament provides the Holy Spirit with opportunities to convince you all the more of God\u2019s great love for you and your family.\nThere are good Christian books that can apply God\u2019s word to your family\u2019s situation. One such book is When Jesus is There. The description of this book is: \u201cTopics include having a child with a serious illness\u2026\u201d It is available from Northwestern Publishing House.\nI hope you are able to speak with your pastor about these matters. He is in a position to address the spiritual needs of your family. God bless you and your family."}
{"prompt": "Pastors and dating", "completion": "Can a WELS pastor date/marry a member of the church where he preaches?\n\n\nThere is no scriptural prohibition for our pastors to date or marry a woman who belongs to the congregation where he preaches. (That was actually my father and mother\u2019s situation.)\nWhat both parties will want to recognize is the potential for awkwardness if the relationship does not lead to marriage."}
{"prompt": "God and life", "completion": "Am I correct in my belief that God decides how long we are to live, before our conception? That is, while we have a say in how we die, neither we, nor the medical profession, have any control over when. In other words, if a person commits suicide, while the choice and method are a sin, they would have otherwise died another way. For your information, I'm not trying to suggest that we shouldn't take proper care of ourselves, or refuse to go to the doctor, as I realize they are the method, as it were, of staying alive, even if not the cause.\n\n\nLet me pass along a response to a question similar to yours. The response includes the thought of taking care of the bodies God has given us that you expressed.\n\u201cA clear passage that speaks of all our days as already known by God is Psalm 139:16. \u2018All the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be.\u2019 Nothing happens in this life without God permitting, guiding, and directing it to serve his ultimate purpose.\n\u201cHowever, this is one of those places where we must realize that Scripture says \u2018two\u2019 things that will seem contradictory to human reason. Scripture also clearly indicates that we are responsible to God for actions we take and decisions we make that impact our life and health\u2026 Trust in God does not mean that we forego wise care for our health and life.\n\u201cSo, here are the two things that we must say in order to keep our biblical balance. Are all our days known by God\u2014exactly what they will be and how they will end\u2014before I ever live them? Yes. Are we responsible for our actions and decisions that impact our health and life? Yes.\n\u201cAnd how can we with our human reason reconcile how both of these things can be true? That is where we leave it up to God whose ways and thoughts and reason are far, far beyond ours (Isaiah 55:8-9).\u201d"}
{"prompt": "People without the gospel", "completion": "What happens to people who do not believe in Christianity due to a lack of exposure? (For example, people who may live remotely, or people who are of a different religion and have never been exposed to Christianity.)\n\n\nGod reveals his existence by means of what we call the \u201cnatural knowledge of God.\u201d Through creation (Psalm 19:1-4) and conscience (Romans 2:14-15), God makes it known that he exists. While people cannot bring themselves to saving faith, God\u2019s purpose with this \u201cnatural knowledge\u201d is that people would \u201cseek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from any one of us\u201d (Acts 17:27).\nApart from the Bible, people know that there is a God, they know the basics of the Ten Commandments and they have a conscience that reacts to their thoughts and words and actions. It is only in the Bible though where people find the answer to the question: \u201cWhat must I do to be saved?\u201d (Acts 16:30) There is salvation only in Jesus Christ (Acts 4:12). What God reveals in the Bible is that faith in Jesus is essential for salvation (Mark 16:16). God also reveals that he brings people to saving faith in Jesus through his gospel in word and sacrament (Romans 10:14-17).\nSo, what about people who have not \u201cbeen exposed to Christianity?\u201d Through technological advances, the message of the Bible is reaching more and more parts of our world. Yet, there are people who have never heard of the gospel of Jesus Christ; some of those people may live closer to us than we think. What about their eternal fate if their lives on earth come to an end with an ignorance of the gospel?\nIs God to blame for their situation? Not at all. We need to put the blame where it belongs: on people and not on God. There were times when the entire human race knew the gospel. Back in the Garden of Eden and after the Flood in Noah\u2019s day, every person on the face of the earth knew the gospel. When we consider a question like yours, we have to ask: \u201cWhen and where did communication break down? Where did communication of the gospel break down? Who dropped the ball in teaching the gospel to the next generation?\u201d It does not take much for communication\u2014and gospel communication\u2014to break down, and the results are tragic.\nSo what we are left with is what God says in his word about the necessity of faith and the necessity to spread the gospel so the Holy Spirit can work through it and bring others to saving faith in Jesus. Your question is one that emphasizes how important it is to do what Jesus said two millennia ago: \u201cGo into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation\u201d (Mark 16:15)."}
{"prompt": "God and daily life", "completion": "Does God send signs to us in our daily lives (through coincidences, dreams, etc.) about specific decisions we should make, sins to avoid, etc.?\n\n\nThere are in narratives in the Bible that describe God communicating to people through dreams (for example, Matthew 1:20). Nowhere has God promised to communicate in the same manner today.\nThe means through which God communicates to you and me is through his word, the Bible. There he tells us which sins to avoid and how to use our lives for his glory and the good of our neighbor.\nWhen it comes to \u201cspecific decisions\u201d in life, God gives you and me great freedom in making decisions. We can think about the wise management of God\u2019s resources, the ways we can care for our families and neighbors, and how we might glorify God (1 Corinthians 10:31).

During their meetings the men meet separately for Bible study/etc. Is it biblically wrong for my wife to join that group or myself to fellowship with those men? If we knew of a local WELS moms group nearby we would look into it too. I appreciate any biblical clarity and feedback you have for helping us make wise, godly decisions. Thank you!\n\n\nWhen Christians are joined together in faith and doctrine, they are able to express their unity by joint prayer and worship, cooperative educational endeavors and shared outreach efforts (Acts 1:14; 2:42; Hebrews 10:24-25; Psalm 78:4-7; 3 John 5-8). When you and I interact with Christians whose faith differs from ours, we follow Scripture\u2019s instructions and do not engage in those previously mentioned activities (Romans 16:17; Titus 3:10; 2 John 10-11). By not worshiping, studying the Bible or praying together with other Christians, you and I are not intending to say that we do not consider such people to be outside the faith. God alone can see what is in the heart (1 Samuel 16:7). We readily and happily acknowledge that the kingdom of God is bigger than our synod. Refraining from prayer, Bible study and worship with people who are not united with us in faith and doctrine is, as our Catechism points out from Scripture, a matter of showing love for the truth of God\u2019s word (2 Corinthians 13:8), love for our own souls (Galatians 5:9) and love for those who are mixing error with truth (James 5:19-20).\nBecause your congregation and the Missouri Synod congregation are not united in faith and doctrine, you want to refrain from those activities that you asked about: prayer and Bible study. Those activities would be possible if the congregations were in fellowship with each other.\nIf your wife is interested in a moms group, the burden for organizing it need not fall on her. I would suggest that you and your wife present the idea of a moms group and a men\u2019s Bible study group to your pastor and the leaders of your congregation. Perhaps your congregation can collaborate with another WELS congregation nearby to offer spiritual and fellowship opportunities for men and women. God bless you and your family!"}
{"prompt": "Grounds for divorce", "completion": "If a man is lying to a woman before they get married and she catches him in the affair, is that biblical grounds for divorce? The lies get worse and he's on drugs. He won't pay bills or provide food and necessities for his family. She begs for him to get help and he refuses. She leaves a few times for a night to try to get him to change, but he wouldn't. I'm already divorced, just really struggling .\n\n\nTo me, your words reflect unfaithfulness (Matthew 19:9) and desertion (1 Corinthians 7:15) on the part of the man. Such actions are biblical grounds for divorce.\nAs this question and answer forum is not suited to provide the spiritual care and support you need, I encourage you to contact your pastor and speak to him. If, for whatever reason, you do not see yourself being able to speak to your pastor about this, consider using the counseling resources available from Christian Family Solutions, a WELS-affiliated ministry. In addition to face-to-face counseling, they also offer video counseling. God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Contemporary worship", "completion": "What is the WELS view on contemporary worship styles?\n\n\nWe recognize that God has not prescribed how we are to worship him. Because of that, we enjoy Christian freedom in our corporate worship life. Decisions about worship styles are made at the congregational level.\nWhat guides congregations in their worship life is a desire to glorify God (1 Corinthians 10:31), to do things in an orderly way (1 Corinthians 14:40) and to give God our best (Isaiah 1; Malachi 1). Recognizing the diversity of the body of Christ (Revelation 7:9) will also lead congregations to conduct worship services in ways that reflect the culture(s) of their members.\nRegardless of worship styles, our worship is and needs to remain focused on Jesus Christ, the Son of God, our Savior. Our worship is and needs to remain focused on the Triune God. Our worship is and needs to remain focused on the precious gospel of our Lord. When that focus is maintained, then the \u201chow\u201d of worship can be kept in proper perspective."}
{"prompt": "Church of Satan", "completion": "Why would a member of the Church of Satan and magic get into a number of years in a relationship, hiding the fact? Can it work with one believing in God and the other doesn't?\n\n\nTruthfulness is not a trait of Satan (John 8:44) and, quite frankly, one would not expect that trait from a member of the Church of Satan.\nI don\u2019t know what kind of relationship you have in mind with your second question. If it is marriage, I have difficulty imagining any kind of good relationship, like marriage, between a Christian and a member of the Church of Satan. Marriage is an intimate bond of husband and wife. The most important bond that can exist between them is that of the same faith: the Christian faith. When one of the spouses is actively supporting and following Satan, that person is going the opposite direction in life (and headed toward a different place in eternity) than his or her spouse.\nChristians will want to warn Church of Satan members of the eternal fate of Satan and his followers (Revelation 20:10-15), share the saving gospel of Jesus Christ with them (Acts 4:12) and pray for them."}
{"prompt": "Marriage and government", "completion": "Would a religious commitment ceremony be accepted in God's eyes? Giving yourself before God just no legal paperwork? \n\n\nWhile God established marriage (Genesis 2:18-24; Matthew 19:4-6), society regulates marriage through its government.\nAs state governments regulate marriage through the issuance of marriage licenses, we render obedience to the government (Romans 13:1-7) by obtaining marriage licenses. A \u201creligious commitment ceremony\u201d needs the accompanying legal documentation required by our government."}
{"prompt": "Existence of heaven", "completion": "Is there really a heaven?\n\n\nYes, there is a heaven. We know that from God\u2019s revelation of this information in the Bible. While Bible writers use \u201cheavens\u201d to refer to the sky and the earth\u2019s surrounding atmosphere (Genesis 1:1; Revelation 21:1), the Bible ordinarily speaks of heaven as that place where God reveals himself in all his glory and where his children can see him face-to-face.\nThe Bible tells us that Jesus is preparing for the time when he will meet all his followers in heaven (John 14:1-6), and that Jesus is the only way to heaven (John 14:6; Acts 4:12)."}
{"prompt": "Interpretation of image of God", "completion": "I noticed a question on WELS Q&A with regard to the image of God being lost at the Fall of Man and restored in Christians.  While I completely agree that the image of God referred to in Genesis 1:26 was lost in the fall and that man is now born dead in trespasses and sin with no righteousness of his own, I also see a different usage of the image of God used in Genesis 9:6, which I believe still sets humans apart from other life...one with intellect/will etc., though because of sin these are born without righteousness. I agree with Paul E. Kretzmann when he comments on this verse:  \"For in the image of God made He man: murder is a violation of the image of God in man, which the Lord intends to restore in all those that are renewed in faith, and which He wants all men to put on. In a wider sense, therefore, man bears even now the image of God, since he is a rational creature and has an immortal soul.\" Would I be allowed to hold to this view and still remain in fellowship with a WELS congregation as long as I recognized that some hold a different interpretation here and did not attempt to force my opinion on those who disagree?  Thank you for your input.\n\n\nThe quotation you supplied illustrates a portion of an answer to a previous question on this subject: \u201cWhile there are some Lutheran theologians who speak of people still being made, in a limited sense, in the image of God insofar as they have intellect and will, it is more consistent with Scripture to say that the image of God was lost through the fall into sin and is restored in Christians.\u201d\nThe attitude you described\u2014holding to an interpretation like this, while not forcing it on others\u2014would not be a barrier to membership in one of our congregations. Your concern to avoid divisiveness (Titus 3:10) is commendable."}
{"prompt": "Seeing others in heaven", "completion": "Is it true that Catholics go to a separate place in heaven and those who are not Catholic will not see them?\n\n\nAll people who trust in Jesus Christ as their only Savior from sin, regardless of which visible church they were a part of during their earthly lives, will be in the presence of God in heaven and will see each other (Mark 16:16).\nThe Bible teaches that there are only two places where people will spend eternity: heaven or hell. Revelation chapters 20 through 22 describe those places."}
{"prompt": "Avoiding another", "completion": "I have forgiven a person, but because of a toxic situation, I don\u2019t want anything to do with them.   Is that wrong?\n\n\nWith limited information, I can offer only a general response.\nIt is good that you forgave someone who sinned against you. That is what we are to do (Colossians 3:13).\nManaging potential conflicts with another person can be a wise course of action. Without knowing the situation, I would simply encourage anyone in a situation like yours to make sure that avoiding a person is not a substitute for resolving an issue. Scripture instructs us to \u201cGet rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice\u201d (Ephesians 4:31). That is something we want and need to do\u2014with or without interaction of other people.\nGod bless your efforts to carry out God\u2019s will: \u201cIf it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone\u201d (Romans 12:18)."}
{"prompt": "Church and expenses", "completion": "For a variety of reasons, our congregation has lost many member families.  As a result, the monthly tithe does not meet our \"budgeted\" expenses.  Can we ask the pastor to take a lower salary?  As we take funds from the savings account to cover his salary, the account will be depleted in 9 months and the church will have zero money. What happens to our church?  I am a worried member.\r\n\n\n\nWhen you mention \u201cmonthly tithe,\u201d I have to wonder what that means. It would be wonderful if \u201cmonthly tithe\u201d meant that your fellow members, in Christian freedom, were giving ten percent of their income back to God. As it is, the current estimate is that the average percentage of giving compared to income of all WELS communicant members is 2.5%. It goes without saying that if that number were higher, there would be far fewer financial difficulties in our synod. God willing, the level of giving on the part of your fellow church members is higher than the percentage listed.\nIf expenses continue to outpace offerings in your church, the leadership of your congregation, along with your pastor, will need to explore different options. Because I am unaware of your congregation\u2019s circumstances, I do not know if any of the following ideas might be applicable to your situation.\nIs it possible to combine your congregation\u2019s ministries with those of another, nearby WELS congregation? Is a multi-site strategy one that your congregation would consider? Would your congregation be interested in the services of WELS Commission on Congregational Counseling?\nReducing your pastor\u2019s salary would be only a stopgap measure. Certainly, Christian love would call for your pastor\u2019s input on any discussion of reducing his salary and benefits. Your congregation wants to be mindful of this biblical instruction: \u201cThe elders who direct the affairs of the church well are worthy of double honor, especially those whose work is preaching and teaching\u201d (1 Timothy 5:17).\nI encourage you to cast this anxiety (1 Peter 5:7) on the Lord in prayer and dismiss your worries. Be concerned, yes, but don\u2019t cross the line into worry. God can \u201cdo immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine\u201d (Ephesians 3:20). God bless you and your congregation."}
{"prompt": "Valid Baptism", "completion": "Hello, recently my wife and I have started attending a WELS church. We quickly felt at home there and decided to look into membership and have our son baptized. He is a little older at just under 2 years. As he is a little older than a traditional infant baptism, he was a little difficult to handle, so during the baptism the pastor dipped his hands in the water and wiped it out sons head three times instead of pouring it over his head. Is this method still a legitimate way to baptize? I am still trying to learn more and make sure our son was properly baptized while we on our path to membership. I was too embarrassed to ask our pastor, as we are still learning.  Thank you for your time.\n\n\nA valid Baptism is the application of water and God\u2019s word (Matthew 28:19). The Bible does not prescribe how to apply water in Baptism. The Greek word for \u201cbaptize\u201d can mean the application of water in various ways (Mark 7:3-4; Luke 11:38). The Baptism of your son was legitimate, proper and valid.\nDon\u2019t be afraid to ask the pastor who baptized your son questions like this. He will be happy to address them. Conversations like that can help build a relationship with him. God bless you and your family as you \u201cgrow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ\u201d (2 Peter 3:18)."}
{"prompt": "School choice", "completion": "Does Act 59 of the Wisconsin school choice program cross the line of separation of church and state ?\n\n\nLet me pass along responses from previous, similar questions.\n\u201cGod has established government so that people may live in some degree of peace in a sin-filled world. The government\u2019s responsibility is to preserve the greatest possible peace and order in the world by punishing evil-doers, rewarding those who do good, and protecting the rights of the law-abiding\u2026The mission and tools of the church are quite different. God has established the church so that people may live with him in peace forever. The church\u2019s responsibility is to preach the gospel and to administer the sacraments through which saving faith is created and nourished. The church does not wage its battles with the sword of the state, but with the sword of the Spirit, the Word of God (Matthew 28:19-20, John 18:36-37, also 2 Corinthians 10:4-6, Ephesians 6:3-17). The church is not responsible for disciplining those outside the church (1 Corinthians 5:12). Since God has assigned to both the church and the state their own distinct purposes and distinct tools, these should not become mixed or confused. Neither church nor state should try to do the work of the other. Neither should ask the other to do its work. Neither should seek to accomplish its ends by using the tools of the other. Observing these distinctions of purposes and tools is what we mean by \u2018the separation of church and state.\u2019\n\u201cIn dealing with issues of church and state and Christian education we have to distinguish between three questions: 1) Is this activity scriptural? This, of course, is determined by the Bible. 2) Is this legal? This is determined by the courts. 3) Is this cooperation with the state wise or might this entangle our school in government controls? Finally, this judgment rests with the responsible governing body of the school.\u201d\nBy making financial aid available, government is not establishing or supporting a specific faith (cf. the First Amendment)."}
{"prompt": "Joyce Meyer Ministries", "completion": "Joyce Meyer TV Ministry - I find her interesting.  What is your opinion on her teachings?  I have not found anything against the Bible in her sermons.\n\n\nOur synod does not have an official evaluation of ministries like Joyce Meyer Ministries.\nInformation that I found on her website reveals some basic Christian teachings, but also includes errors such as decision theology, emphasis on charismatic gifts like spiritual healing and a prosperity gospel that is placed in the context of helping others.\nErrors like these call for the implementation of biblical instructions like Romans 16:17 and 2 John 9-11."}
{"prompt": "Child abuse", "completion": "Is child abuse sinful?  Lately the Turpin Case has been in the news a lot, and I witnessed a Baptist completely justifying their child abuse.  He said that the Turpin family did a good thing chaining up their children because that was protecting them from sin.  He said that the police who intervened were wrong and that the parenting tactics the Turpin family used were good Christian parenting tactics.  I personally feel very shocked and disgusted that someone who professes to be a Christian would justify such horrific child abuse.  \n\n\nChild abuse is sinful and indefensible. Parents who are guilty of child abuse have failed to carry out their God-given parental responsibilities and have not represented God well to their children (cf. the fourth commandment). Parents who are guilty of child abuse need to be called to repentance."}
{"prompt": "Books on dating", "completion": "I recently started dating someone and was hoping to find a book on the topic of Christian dating.  Are there any books you would recommend?\n\n\nI have not been successful in locating books available from Northwestern Publishing House on the subject of dating. Perhaps you want to contact them.\nYou may find helpful books on dating from this source.\nYour church library or your pastor\u2019s library might also be good resources for you. God bless you as you seek to apply God\u2019s word to this important part of life."}
{"prompt": "Reading list", "completion": "Do you happen to have a list of WELS books that I can read aside from the Bible? \n\n\nYou will find WELS-produced books and books available from other publishers at Northwestern Publishing House.\nThere are many books in different categories.

The series offers commentary on all the books of the Bible.\nYou will find a toll-free phone number on the website if you have further questions."}
{"prompt": "Caring for the dying", "completion": "I have grown up WELS, attended parochial grade school, and kept up with Bible studies. I closely follow questions and answers and was recently distressed to read the question regarding people who are near death seeing loved ones, talking as with loved ones. As a nurse for many years, I have observed this happening. I have always felt happy for these people until I read the answer.  I know the devil can masquerade as a being of light, and I now fear that all these people have been agreeing to go with the devil. I am wondering if I am now to tell people in those last moments that it is not their loved ones.  Not only would that greatly distress me, but family members present would not allow it. If these are people who I have been working with for a while, I would read from the Bible.  As a nurse working in public hospitals I frequently walk into a daily assignment where a person is actively dying. Looking back on all the deaths I have been present for where the person seems to be aware of and communicating with an already dead person, I feel very distressed that I may have encouraged people to go with the devil. Please help me with this. I feel terrible about this.\n\n\nThe question you referenced was in the context of Satan being associated with paranormal experiences as a final way of deceiving people, so the response went along those same lines.\nMight God give Christians a first glimpse at their heavenly glory in the moments before death? God can do anything. God did that for Stephen even before the stones started coming his way (Acts 7:55-56).\nYou and I are limited in knowing exactly what dying individuals might be experiencing. I would encourage you to continue to carry out your important work, offering the care to your patients for which you have received training. I would also encourage you not to second guess your past actions. You and I do what we can\u2014with the limitations we have\u2014to serve others."}
{"prompt": "Church and state responsibilities", "completion": "My wife and I have slightly varying views on politics in light of God\u2019s word. We recently had a discussion about how we should think about universal healthcare in the US. She tends to agree with it citing Christ\u2019s command to take care of the poor and she says that individuals like Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates, who have more money than they can possibly use in this lifetime, should have to give over a larger portion of their wealth to the state to support those that are less fortunate.  I of course understand Christ\u2019s commands to take care of the poor, but I see this as a command directed to us as individual Christians, apart from the kingdom of the state.  Could you please provide scriptural guidance on how to align our thinking on this issue? Thanks.\n\n\nThe church and state have different responsibilities. I can point you to the following information from This We Believe: a statement of belief of our church body.\n\u201cWe believe that God has given the church and the state their own distinct responsibilities. To the church the Lord has assigned the responsibility of calling sinners to repentance, of proclaiming forgiveness through the cross of Christ, and of encouraging believers in their Christian living. The purpose is to lead the elect of God to eternal salvation through faith in Christ. To the state the Lord has assigned the duty of keeping good order and peace, of punishing the wrongdoer, and of arranging all civil matters in society (Romans 13:3,4). The purpose is \u2018that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness\u2019 (1 Timothy 2:2)\u2026\n\u201cWe believe the proper relation is preserved between the church and the state only when each remains within its divinely assigned sphere and uses its divinely entrusted means. The church should not exercise civil authority nor interfere with the state as the state carries out its responsibilities. The state should not become a messenger of the gospel nor interfere with the church in its preaching mission. The church should not attempt to use the civil law and force to lead people to Christ. The state should not seek to govern by means of the gospel. On the other hand, the church and the state may cooperate in an endeavor as long as each remains within its assigned place and uses its entrusted means.\n\u201cWe believe that Christians are citizens of both realms and serve God by faithfully fulfilling their duties in both (Romans 13:6,7).\u201d\nIn our individual lives as \u201ccitizens of both realms,\u201d we will seek to love God and our neighbor. The Bible instructs Christians: \u201cTherefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers\u201d (Galatians 6:10)."}
{"prompt": "Lutheran church bodies in Canada", "completion": "Is the Lutheran Church-Canada one of those in fellowship with WELS?\n\n\nNo. Lutheran Church-Canada is in fellowship with the Lutheran Church\u2014Missouri Synod. The Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) is in fellowship with WELS-Canada."}
{"prompt": "Global warming", "completion": "I don't think that WELS has an official stance on man-made global warming, but I was wondering what your thoughts regarding it are.  I am certainly against polluting our world and I am all for reducing waste, recycling and being a good steward of God's creation.  However, I think it is arrogant and sinful to think that we can change the weather or climate that God provides, by anything that we do as people.  I am reminded of the book of Job, when God beautifully asks Job if he knows where the weather comes from and where God stores all of these things, such as hail, snow, wind, rain, etc.  Just curious what your thoughts are concerning global warming and my comments.  Thank you!\n\n\nYou are correct in noting that we do not have an official stance on the question you asked about. Global warming is not a subject that the Bible addresses.\nThe Bible teaches that God entrusted people with management of his creation (Genesis 2:15), but he still rules over his creation (Psalm 135:5-7). God remains the owner of his creation (Psalm 24:1) and he will preserve his creation until the Last Day (2 Peter 3:7)."}
{"prompt": "Conversation with pastor", "completion": "A current WELS pastor admitted to me four years ago that he does not accept the biblical teaching of close communion. What should I do about this?\n\n\nIt would have been good to continue the conversation with the pastor at that time. Now, years later, you could speak to the pastor and reference that conversation. Returning to that conversation could tell you whether the pastor is holding to a personal false belief and whether that translates into an open communion practice. If there were an open communion practice, nearby sister congregations and pastors would likely be aware of it and appropriate action would be taken.\nSpeaking to the pastor one-on-one would be in line with biblical principles (Exodus 20:16; Matthew 18:15). The content of that private conversation would determine what, if anything, you would do next."}
{"prompt": "Churches and elections", "completion": "Will WELS officially ever be able to say why a person should not vote for this or that person?\n\n\nCurrent law prohibits churches from campaigning for a candidate. The WELS Tax Manual includes this information for our churches: \u201cUnder the IRC [Internal Revenue Code], all section 501(c)(3) organizations are absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office. Contributions to political campaign funds or public statements of position (verbal or written) made on behalf of the exempt organization in favor of or in opposition to any candidate for public office clearly violate the prohibition against political campaign activity. Violation of this prohibition may result in denial or revocation of tax-exempt status and the imposition of certain excise tax.\u201d\nCould the current law be reversed at some point in the future? Possibly, but churches would want to be careful that they do not bind the consciences of their members. Our churches can teach good citizenship (Romans 13:1-7), which includes an encouragement to vote without endorsing specific candidates."}
{"prompt": "Salvation and condemnation", "completion": "Do you believe Jesus will have all mankind saved (1 Timothy 2:4 KJV)?  In other words, do you believe that eternal life shall never end, but that eternal condemnation ends as Christ's government and peace increase with no end to have all mankind saved (Isaiah 9:7 KJV), to be made new (Revelation 21:5 & Ecclesiastes 3:11), to cross over from condemnation to eternal life (John 5:24)?\n\n\nGod does want \u201call people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth\u201d (1 Timothy 2:4). God does not want \u201canyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance\u201d (2 Peter 3:9).\nThe Bible teaches that faith in Jesus saves, while unbelief condemns (Mark 16:16). God\u2019s judgment on the Last Day is permanent, eternal. Consider these Bible passages. \u201cMultitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt\u201d (Daniel 12:2). \u201cThen they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life\u201d (Matthew 25:46). \u201cHe [the Lord Jesus] will punish those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might on the day he comes to be glorified in his holy people and to be marveled at among all those who have believed\u201d (2 Thessalonians 1:8-9).\nThe Lord\u2019s kingdom is certainly an eternal one (Isaiah 9:7). When it comes to the new heaven and new earth, God will make everything new (Revelation 21:5) for his children. Ecclesiastes 3:11 speaks of people recognizing that there is something more than just this life: an eternity awaits. When people are led to believe in Jesus Christ as their Savior, they have eternal life and they are no longer spiritually dead (John 5:24).\nWhen we recognize that hell is an eternal place, we will want to do whatever we can to spread the gospel so that others, through Spirit-worked faith in Jesus, can avoid that place and, instead, enjoy the eternal love of God (Psalm 23:6)."}
{"prompt": "Purpose of Jesus' descent into hell", "completion": "Why did Christ descend into hell?\n\n\nBy his descent into hell (1 Peter 3:18-20), Jesus declared his victory over Satan and the forces of evil.

{"prompt": "Attending a wedding", "completion": "My nephew is getting married in an ELCA church. I'm not sure how I should handle this. I would rather not even attend, but this would cause a lot of trouble with my family. I'm thinking of going and keeping a very low profile. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you. \n\n\nIt is certainly possible to be in attendance at a worship service in a church outside our fellowship. On an occasion such as that, you and I are observers rather than worshipers. That means that we refrain from joining in worship with others.\nWhen I find myself in a setting like that, I am interested in not being a distraction to those who are worshiping. That means that I stand and sit when directed, but I do not participate in the liturgy, prayers or hymns. Since other people in attendance do not participate in worship for various reasons, I am not conspicuous as an observer and non-worshiper.\nUnless your conscience (Romans 14; 1 Corinthians 8) is guiding you not to attend the wedding, you can certainly be present at the service as an observer."}
{"prompt": "The meanings of \"bless\"", "completion": "Help me understand the various biblical uses of bless, blessing, and blessed (including if there's a difference in the one-syllable and two-syllable pronunciations).  Correspondingly, what is the difference of God blessing us and our blessing God? And, growing up in the WELS I learned the common table prayer, \"Come, Lord Jesus,\" yet it recently occurred to me that I'm not certain about the meaning of \"and let this food to us be blessed.\" In the movie musical \"The sound of Music\" Maria offers this table prayer (or something very similar), \"Dear Lord, For what we are about to receive may we be truly thankful. Amen.\"  Is that another way of saying the aforementioned phrase? \n\n\nWhen it comes to our actions toward God, \u201cbless\u201d means \u201cto praise.\u201d The meaning of a verse like Psalm 103:1 becomes clear when we compare the King James Version (\u201cBless the Lord, O my soul\u201d) to other Bible translations that state: \u201cPraise the Lord, O my soul.\u201d\nWhen it comes to God\u2019s actions toward us, \u201cbless\u201d means \u201cto bestow good.\u201d\nIn the common table prayer we are asking God to use the food we are about to receive for the nourishment and strengthening of our bodies.\nIn the prayer from the movie that you cited, the request we make of God is that he would lead us to be thankful for the food he has provided.\n\u201cBlessed\u201d as a one-syllable or two-syllable adjective (as in Matthew 5:3-11) describes children of God enjoying his love.\nSo, as blessed people of God, we bless the Lord."}
{"prompt": "Family table prayer", "completion": "My dad, who passed away some years ago, used to periodically offer a similar table prayer to \"Come, Lord Jesus\" using more antiquated language. The rest of us would join our hearts but not our lips, so I never learned it and can only recall that it used \"mayest\", \"thou\", et cetera. Was this a prayer that he'd likely created or repeated from another individual, or was there such a Synodical Conference version penned and published (my father was raised in both LCMS and WELS congregations)?   If the latter is true, I would appreciate receiving the words.\n\n\nI have no way of knowing, but perhaps your dad might have used Psalm 145:15-16 from the King James Version: \u201cThe eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat in due season. Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing.\u201d The word \u201cmayest\u201d is not in those verses, but those words of the psalm writer have been the basis of table prayers for generations."}

{"prompt": "God and his promises", "completion": "What do you do when God's promises don't come true?\n\n\nI do not know what disappointment you have experienced, but I would encourage you to return to Scripture and read again what God says about keeping his promises. Here is a sampling of what the Bible says about God\u2019s faithfulness in carrying out what he has promised.\n\u201cGod is not human, that he should lie, not a human being, that he should change his mind.\u201d\n\u201cDoes he speak and then not act? Does he promise and not fulfill?\u201d (Numbers 23:19)\n\u201cThe LORD is trustworthy in all he promises and faithful in all he does\u201d (Psalm 145:13).\n\u201cFor no matter how many promises God has made, they are \u2018Yes\u2019 in Christ. And so through him the \u2018Amen\u2019 is spoken by us to the glory of God\u201d (2 Corinthians 1:20).\n\u201cIf we are faithless, he [God] remains faithful, for he cannot disown himself\u201d (2 Timothy 2:13).\nLife\u2019s circumstances might seem to suggest that God has failed to carry out his promises, but God\u2019s track record is perfect: he always does what he says. With his age-old question of \u201cDid God really say?\u201d Satan continually seeks to attack God\u2019s word and get us to doubt God\u2019s faithfulness. What God really says in his word is that he is faithful to all his promises. I pray that God\u2019s own words about his faithfulness encourages you in the faith."}

{"prompt": "Visit from friend", "completion": "Hi, I'm dating a girl who will be visiting me for a weekend because she lives far away.  She asked if she could sleep in the same bed with me, and I told her that I believe couples shouldn't sleep together outside of marriage.  She responded by saying that only applies to sex in bed, which she said she isn't interested in doing.  I wasn't sure to how to respond, and was hoping for your thoughts on this question:  Is a couple sleeping in the same bed outside of marriage wrong if they don't have sex?\r\n \n\n\nIt is wrong on several counts. For starters, rather than distancing yourself from temptations to engage in sexual activity (1 Corinthians 6:18), you would be putting temptation right in front of you and your friend. Additionally, if you think you would be able to withstand those temptations, Scripture offers a warning (1 Corinthians 10:12).\nSecondly, the Bible teaches: \u201cBut among you there must not even be a hint of sexual immorality\u201d (Ephesians 5:3). Two people of the opposite sex sharing a bed creates more than a hint.\nNext, the Bible warns us about causing offense to others (Matthew 18:6-7) and emboldening them to sin against God\u2019s will or their consciences.\nIt would be good for you to find different accommodations for your friend when she visits you. That way you can both honor and glorify God with your lives (1 Corinthians 10:31)."}
{"prompt": "Location of Luther's \"kidnapping\"", "completion": "I travel to Wittenberg every year for the Reformationsfest.  I have seen pretty much every \"Luther point of interest,\"but I have never learned of the exact location of Luther\u2018s kidnapping.  Where is that location?  Thanks so much.\n\n\nThe following narrative will steer you in the right direction: \u201cLuther spent the night with his relatives and preached in the village [of Moehra] the next morning before proceeding on the journey home. A relative supplied them with fresh horses. To return to the Gotha highway from Moehra, they had to travel over the Schweina road past the Castle Altenstein and through the forest of Waltershausen. Some of the relatives accompanied the party until nearly nightfall, by which time they had reached the neighborhood of the Castle Altenstein. Here Luther bade his relatives good-by and continued the journey. His friends were scarcely out of sight when four or five armed horsemen rushed from the woods near the chapel and surrounded the helpless travelers at the spot which today is called Lutherbuche. The monk Petzensteiner leaped from the wagon and ran through the woods toward Waltershausen, but Luther whispered to Amsdorf, \u2018Do not become excited. We are among friends.\u2019\u201d [E.G. Schwiebert, Luther and His Times (St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1950), 514]\nThere is a monument in Glasbachgrund, on the Luther Trail, that commemorates the event described above."}
{"prompt": "Without a church home", "completion": "I am currently without a church home.  The last WELS church I attended left a foul taste in my mouth from the way the pastor treated my children's learning. Now all the churches in close proximity to me are not WELS; most are non denominational or ELCA. Is it better to be without a church or better to go to one that doesn't believe as I do? Also where in the Bible does it say I will go to hell if I do not attend church?\n\n\nThere is much I do not know about your situation, so I will not limit myself to the options you listed. I am unaware of the distance between you and the nearest WELS church. I have known people who regularly drove many miles to attend worship services in our congregations. I also wonder if you could be living in an area where there are other WELS members who could be served by one of our pastors. Individuals in your situation have been served in a variety of ways including worship via livestreaming, supplemented by periodic Holy Communion services. It would be good for you to contact the church where you and your family last had membership to know where the closest WELS church might be.\nI hope you are able to make such contact and that there is no bitterness (Ephesians 4:31) from your most recent experience with one of our churches.\nIt is unbelief that condemns (Mark 16:16). Despising preaching and God\u2019s word (the third commandment) is sinful. I catch in your words a desire to worship and hear the word of God. I pray that you are able to connect to the spiritual resources you and your family need. God bless you all."}

In such instances, we \u201cdo not give dogs what is sacred\u201d and we \u201cdo not throw\u2026pearls to pigs.\u201d\u00a0 We move on and share the word of God with others."}

A person who has doubts or still has some reservations about a doctrine could be a member if that person was continuing to work with the pastor and in personal study to resolve that doubt, but such a person could not be a member if he or she was speaking against the doctrine in the church or making propaganda for opposing views. However, if you are convinced that our doctrine is wrong and unscriptural, you should not join the church because you would be sinning against your own conscience.

{"prompt": "Polygamy", "completion": "Recently on the WELS discussion page it was stated that polygamy is not a sin.  Martin Luther was even referenced by one person.  Is it true that polygamy is not a sin?\n\n\nPolygamy is a sinful deviation from God\u2019s design that marriage be between one man and one woman (Genesis 2:20-24; Matthew 19:4-6; Romans 7:2-3; 1 Corinthians 7:2; 1 Timothy 3:2; Titus 1:6). The fact that God did not intervene in people\u2019s lives when they went beyond his design and will does not equate to approval on his part. The biblical narratives of those people who went beyond \u201cone man, one woman\u201d paint a home life marred by strife and troubles. Those narratives illustrate how God\u2019s ways are always best\u2014including what he says about his institution of marriage."}
{"prompt": "\"Obeying the gospel\"", "completion": "I was reading through the Q & A and came across the following as a portion of your answer to someone....\r\n\u201cHe [the Lord Jesus] will punish those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.\"\r\nSince the gospel is all about what God has done to save us and it is not about anything we do,  what does it mean to \"obey the gospel\"?\r\nThank you.  \r\n\r\n \n\n\nThe apostle Paul\u2019s inspired words from 2 Thessalonians 1:8 can certainly strike us as sounding strange. His words describe people who reject the gospel of Jesus Christ. 1 Peter 4:17 contains the same message.\nIn Acts 26:19 the apostle used similar language when he spoke of God giving him faith to believe the gospel: \u201cI was not disobedient to the vision from heaven.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "\"I lay my sins on Jesus\"", "completion": "The first stanza of a popular hymn says, \"I Lay My Sins on Jesus.\"\r\nI know of many places in Scripture where we are taught that God has laid upon Jesus the sins of the entire world, and I believe that. But, where in Scripture is it taught that we are to lay our sins on Jesus? Is it even possible for us to do that? \r\nSome have suggested that this hymn refers to repentance. But, it seems to me that we would not be able to repent if our sins had not already been laid upon Christ.\r\nWhat are your thoughts on this?\n\n\nIt would be interesting to know exactly what Horatius Bonar had in mind when this hymn was first published in 1843. Information from The Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal explains that Bonar wrote the hymn (perhaps his first) for children. He acknowledged that the hymn \u201cmight be good Gospel, but that it was poor poetry.\u201d\nGod certainly laid on his Son the sins of the world (Isaiah 53:6; John 1:29). Children of God enjoy forgiveness of sins through Spirit-worked faith in Jesus Christ (Ephesians 1:7). Because we continue to sin, Jesus invites us to receive forgiveness for our sins through his gospel in word and sacrament (Matthew 26:26-28; Colossians 1:13-14). The Lord invites us, people who are weary and burdened, to come to him for rest (Matthew 11:28). The \u201crest\u201d that he provides is forgiveness of sins.\nI am content to understand that the title of the hymn speaks of Jesus living up to his name, which means \u201cSavior.\u201d God put my sins on Jesus. I enjoy full and free forgiveness of sins through the saving faith the Holy Spirit has worked in my heart. My comfort is knowing that if I am plagued by the memory of past sins, I can put them at the foot of the cross\u2014laying them on Jesus, in that sense\u2014and have full confidence that I stand in God\u2019s grace (Romans 5:2). These are some thoughts that come to mind when I think of that hymn title."}
{"prompt": "Knowing others in heaven", "completion": "Will we know others as our relatives and friends in heaven?\n\n\nThere is little information in the Bible on our recognition of others in heaven. Many point to the account of Jesus\u2019 transfiguration where Peter knew who Moses and Elijah were, even though he had never met them before in person (Matthew 17:4; Mark 9:5; Luke 9:33). Some have taken that to mean that we too will know who other Christians in heaven are and how we might have interacted with them during our earthly lives. Others point to 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 where Paul comforted the Christians in Thessalonica with the assurance that they would see Christians who had died in the past and be with them together forever.\nAny specific questions about our eternal life that the Bible does not answer now are addressed in general by these words: \u201cDear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when Christ appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is\u201d (1 John 3:2)."}
{"prompt": "Burial next to spouse", "completion": "If a person remarries after divorce outside of WELS faith, should they be buried next to their previous WELS spouse or more recent spouse? And does it even matter?\n\n\nThe personal preferences of the individuals involved will determine the course of action.\nAs you note in your second question, the significance of whatever action is taken is short-term. It will matter to relatives of the deceased only.\nMuch more important is what Jesus says about death and resurrection: \u201c\u2026a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice and come out\u2014those who have done what is good will rise to live, and those who have done what is evil will rise to be condemned\u201d (John 5:28-29). Christian faith saves and unbelief condemns (Mark 16:16). People display faith and unbelief in everyday living (Matthew 25:31-46)."}
{"prompt": "Attitudes toward sin", "completion": "Can you please explain Hebrews 10:26?  I always thought that the sacrifice of Jesus provided infinite forgiveness from sins.  I heard a Lutheran say that the verse is speaking of apostasy to the faith, though am very confused by it.  I am very confused by Hebrews 10:26, to the point of feeling despair because I feel like I am not good enough to go to heaven.\n\n\n\u201cIf we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left, but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God\u201d (Hebrews 10:26-27). Jesus\u2019 work as Savior has won forgiveness for all sins. Through faith in Jesus we personally enjoy the forgiveness of sins (Ephesians 1:7).\nThe writer to the Hebrews speaks of people who forfeit the forgiveness of sins through impenitence. These are people who \u201creceived the knowledge of the truth.\u201d They know from Scripture what God\u2019s will is, but they \u201cdeliberately keep on sinning.\u201d There is no confession of sin, no struggle against sin, no desire to stop sinning.\nHow different that attitude is from the child of God who struggles against temptation and sin (Romans 7:15-25). When the child of God falls into sin, he or she confesses sin, receives the forgiveness of sins through faith and resolves to wage war against sin all the more.\nLike you, I feel I am not good enough to go to heaven. No, I know I am not good enough to go to heaven. Thankfully, Jesus was perfect in our place. In addition, Jesus took on himself the punishment our sins deserved. Now, through faith in Jesus God sees us as righteous and holy in his sight. Because of Jesus, we presently enjoy forgiveness of sins and peace with God. Because of Jesus, we can look forward in confidence to an eternity of joy and glory with God."}
{"prompt": "Comfort for survivors", "completion": "What kind of comfort can you give someone when their loved one commits suicide and they were supposedly a believer?\n\n\n\u201cThe Lord does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart\u201d (1 Samuel 16:7). You and I want to remember that we cannot see into the heart of anyone who has died, let alone someone who has committed suicide.\nThe Bible teaches that Christian faith saves and unbelief condemns (Mark 16:16). The Bible teaches how vitally important it is to have Christian faith in the heart when life on earth comes to an end (Revelation 2:10).\nThere was a time when Christians concluded that all those who took their own lives were eternally lost. Over time, people recognized that some Christians might have taken their lives without losing their faith. A person who professed Christ as Savior might have committed suicide because of psychological or other mental health issues. With clear thinking, such a person would not have taken his or her life. Another person who professed Christ as Savior might have committed suicide as the result of a rash act or in a moment of weakness, while still being in the faith. Taking one\u2019s life is sinful, but there could be explanations for the actions that do not presuppose the absence of faith. Again, God alone knows what is in a person\u2019s heart at death.\nTo those who are the survivors of a loved one who has died in any way, I would bring the comfort of God\u2019s word. God is still their refuge and strength (Psalm 46). God stands ready to hear and answer their prayers (Psalm 50:15). God promises he will never leave or forsake them (Hebrews 13:5). God promises strength for daily living (Isaiah 41:10).\nYou may be interested in reading And She Was a Christian, a book that addresses the subject of Christians and suicide. Your church library may have a copy. It is available from Northwestern Publishing House. God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Baby shower", "completion": "My daughter is being thrown a baby shower for her second child without being married by the father's mother.  What do I do? Do I attend? Just send something to the baby? I don't celebrate this.  What does our faith say?\n\n\nWithout knowing more about your family situation, the best I can probably do is pass along some things for you to think about.\nOur faith says that we show love to others, especially our family, and that we do not condone sin. So, how can you possibly do both those things?\nIf you were to attend the shower, it might be wise to speak beforehand\u2014privately\u2014to your daughter and also the father\u2019s mother. You could explain to them the difficulties you have with this event, but that you will be attending to support your daughter. Your concern would be to have your presence at the shower interpreted accurately and not misunderstood.\nIf you were to not attend the shower, there could be long-term implications on your relationship with your daughter (and her children), closing the door to future conversations and any Christian witnessing on your part.\nIt seems that your challenge is trying to strike a balance between displaying love and support for your daughter, and testifying to what the Bible says about marriage, sexuality and children. You do want to speak the truth in love to your daughter about her life (Ephesians 4:15).\nYou could probably receive some guidance that is better tailored to your circumstances by speaking to your pastor. I encourage you to do that. God bless you and your family."}
{"prompt": "Sins of parents", "completion": "I've read several memoirs in which the authors publicly reveal detestable acts done by their parents. However, when I look into how to approach \u200eExodus 20:12, most Christian websites acknowledge the difficultly of this commandment, but stand by it, regardless of a parent's actions. What are your thoughts on publicly \"dishonoring\" one's parents by talking about terrible acts they've committed via memoir, TV interview, podcast, etc. - or even to a friend or in a therapy session?\r\n\r\nBonus question: Should one honor both their biological and adoptive parents? \n\n\nAs I do not know how these parents\u2019 detestable acts might have involved their children, my response might be off target.\nIf parents sinned against their children, confessed their sins to their children and received their forgiveness, then \u201cairing\u201d the parents\u2019 sins is out of place.\nIf parents sinned against their children and the matter has not been resolved, then airing the parents\u2019 sins is out of place.\nIf a child has parental permission, he or she could speak publicly about past actions.\nI could envision a scenario in which a person speaks to someone else about a parent\u2019s sins without breaking the eighth commandment. That certainly could be done in a counseling scenario.\nA concern I would have is that a person\u2019s attitude about past sins could lead to sinful anger on their part (Ephesians 4:26).\n\u2014 If a person is in a position of knowing their biological parents, along with their adoptive parents, he or she can now show honor and respect to all involved."}
{"prompt": "Panic attacks", "completion": "My grandson is starting to experience panic attacks, which also affects his father (my son) and me.\r\nMy son stated yesterday that he is mad at God.  He doesn't understand why God would create my grandson with this affliction as the boy has a very strong faith and unusual intelligence/compassion for his age.  I always told my son that God intends great things for the boy to bless him like this.  My son says that now the boy will never achieve any great things because God allowed the boy to be cursed with panic attacks and will be afraid all his life.  What can I say to my son?\n\n\nCreated in the image of God, Adam and Eve initially enjoyed a perfect life on earth. After sin entered their world, life on earth changed for the worse. Troubles and difficulties became a part of daily life (Genesis 3:16-19). Physical death became a consequence of sin. That was true also of spiritual and eternal death. Thanks be to God that he promised a Savior (Genesis 3:15) and fulfilled that promise (Galatians 4:4-5).\nBecause of sin\u2019s entrance into God\u2019s perfect world, there are birth defects, illnesses, diseases and accidents (for example, John 9:1-3). God could prevent these things, just as he could have prevented sin from entering his perfect creation in the first place. God knows what he is doing. He remains wise and kind and powerful.\nYour grandson is the object of God\u2019s love. God sent Jesus into the world for him (John 3:16). God desires the salvation of your grandson (1 Timothy 2:4). Your grandson\u2019s condition does not mean that God loves him less than others.\nIf you have not done so already, I would encourage you to speak to your son about seeking medical treatment for your grandson. Medical personnel can diagnose and suggest best treatment methods. God bless you all."}
{"prompt": "Attitudes of Christian wives", "completion": "What does a submissive wife look like in Christian marriage?\n\n\nIt looks like the Christian church submitting to Christ.\nMany people today see the word \u201csubmit\u201d suggesting a relationship in which one person dominates the other. One person is seen to be in power, while the other is seen in a subservient role.\nWhen the Bible directs people to submit, there is nothing degrading, demeaning or insulting about that instruction. Scripture tells Christians: \u201cSubmit to one another out of reverence for Christ\u201d (Ephesians 5:21). Then, God says: \u201cWives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything\u201d (Ephesians 5:22-24). The model of the Christian Church submitting to the leadership of Christ is the model for Christian women submitting to their husbands.\nIn addition, the relationship between Jesus and the Church provides the model for the way husbands are to treat their wives: \u201cHusbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her\u201d (Ephesians 5:25). Husbands are to have a sacrificial love for their wives. And so it is to a loving leader (Ephesians 5:23) that a Christian wife submits.\nIn an upcoming \u201cLight for our path\u201d column in Forward in Christ I will be explaining more about what a submissive wife in a Christian marriage looks like."}

He would also attend seminars there regularly. Is this an accepted practice now in the WELS?\n\n\nPastors are not exempt from following biblical fellowship principles. Such principles apply to all Christians.\nNot knowing what you might know, I would simply offer the reminder that there is a difference between being present at a worship service in a church outside our fellowship and participating as a worshiper. Similar conclusions could be made about attending a seminar.\nAs a church body, we would be unfaithful to the word of God if violations of biblical fellowship principles\u2014or violations in other doctrinal areas\u2014became accepted practice."}
{"prompt": "Baptism and circumcision", "completion": "What is the difference between Circumcision in the OT and Baptism in the NT?\n\n\nCircumcision (involving males) is no longer commanded by God (1 Corinthians 7:19; Galatians 5:1-6; 6:15). God commands that all people\u2014male and female\u2014be baptized (Matthew 28:19-20).\nColossians 2:11-12 speaks of a parallel between circumcision and Baptism, and the blessings that Baptism bestows: \u201cIn him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not performed by human hands. Your whole self ruled by the flesh was put off when you were circumcised by Christ, having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through your faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.\u201d"}

{"prompt": "Faith and salvation", "completion": "In This We Believe, it states,\r\n\r\n\"We reject every teaching that man in any way contributes to his salvation. We reject all efforts to present faith as a condition man must fulfill to complete his justification. We likewise reject any teaching which says that it does not matter what one believes so long as one has faith. \" This seems to pertain to a question of mine. I informed someone that we are saved \"apart from our own freewill, or choosing\" and that only those who believe this are saved, but he said, \"That's where we disagree. I believe someone can be saved whether they believe that, or not.\" My question is - how do I respond? What scriptural proof may I present him that rejection of the Gospel as we teach it (i.e. salvation apart from our own freewill or choosing) is in fact a rejection of salvation? \r\n\r\nAlso, I was wondering if you would be able to provide the This We Believe Q&A pdf file online, as I unfortunately do not have the means at this time to obtain a copy - I also believe it would be beneficial for others, as well.\r\n\r\nThank-you. \n\n\nFaith in Jesus Christ as the promised Savior and the Son of God is absolutely necessary for salvation. Your question has us look at Christian faith that links people to Christ. Is it possible for people who misunderstand the origin of faith to enjoy the benefits of Christian faith?\nLet me pass along some thoughts from two of my predecessors in this position. They address your question well.\n\u201cMany people who supposedly ask Jesus into their hearts already have saving faith. They got this saving faith from the Holy Spirit working through the gospel and not from any human cooperation or work or contribution \u2014 or by asking for it. In fact, by nature we are all opposed to the gospel and do not appreciate the things of God one bit \u2014 so if a person is saying, \u2018I want Jesus to enter my heart and life; I want him to have his way with me,\u2019 that in itself may be evidence that the Holy Spirit has already created saving faith in that person.\n\u201cWhat is happening, then, is not that these people are necessarily unbelievers, but they are (100% by God\u2019s grace and the Holy Spirit\u2019s work through the gospel) believers who also are very confused or wrong in their words about how a person (including themselves) obtains saving faith. They have what we want them to have (saving faith), but they are not giving God all glory by ascribing this 100% to God\u2019s love and power \u2014 but are in some way including human effort, human cooperation, or human obedience in the matter. Thanks be to God that he still maintains saving faith in some people despite poisonous errors that may also be in a person\u2019s heart.\u201d\nAlso, \u201cDecision theology makes human sense. However, it is biblical nonsense. In addition to crediting dead sinners with spiritual power they don\u2019t possess, the whole concept of \u2018faith\u2019 is distorted. Scripture clearly pictures faith as God\u2019s gift. It is the polar opposite of works. In decision theology, faith becomes at least partially a human work. Adding even the tiniest factor of human effort to God\u2019s salvation equation yields the result of pride (\u2018I made my decision when others failed\u2019) or despair (\u2018Was my decision genuine?). Instead of fixing believers\u2019 eyes alone on Jesus where they find certainty (Hebrews 12:2), decision theology directs believers to the vagaries of the human heart where they find uncertainty (Jeremiah 17:9).\n\u201cAre those who claim to believe in decision theology our brothers and sisters in Christ? Clinging to false doctrine prevents outward fellowship between us. But are they part of the invisible fellowship of Christ\u2019s church? There is grave danger that false belief leads to unbelieving pride or despair. Such is the danger of all false doctrine. But what if, despite unbiblical reasoning, hearts cling to Christ alone and don\u2019t depend on some \u2018decision? Then, despite misunderstanding the \u2018how\u2019 of their conversion, they possess Spirit-worked faith! God grant such a \u2018happy inconsistency\u2019 to the vast majority of those who claim a \u2018decision\u2019 for Jesus.\u201d\nI am not able to pass along a digital file of This We Believe: Questions and Answers.

Now that he has returned to heaven, does he still have his earthly body?\n\n\nI am not entirely sure what you mean by \u201ca heavenly body.\u201d As the eternal Son of God (John 1:1-2), Jesus did not have a physical body (John 4:24). That changed when Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:25) and born of the virgin Mary (Luke 2:6-7). Jesus is the God-Man, true God and true man.\nDuring Jesus\u2019 life and ministry on earth, he had a physical body. The Bible speaks of Jesus\u2019 glorified body after his resurrection from the dead (Colossians 3:20-21). With that same glorified body Jesus ascended into heaven (Acts 1:9). With that same glorified body Jesus will return visibly to this world on the Last Day (Acts 1:11)."}

{"prompt": "Biblical fellowship principles", "completion": "As a WELS member, would it be a sin for to receive Communion in a Missouri Synod (LCMS) church? The reason I ask is that sometimes when we are away from home, such as in the winter months, there is not always a WELS church nearby. Thank you and God bless. \n\n\nWELS and LCMS are not in doctrinal fellowship with one another. Closed communion is the stated practice of both church bodies. Since receiving the Lord\u2019s Supper with other people is an expression of unity of faith (1 Corinthians 10:17), we want to present an image of unity that is accurate and not forced.\nIt is always a serious matter to ignore what God says in his word. Violating biblical fellowship principles is always a serious matter. While there can be extraordinary and exceptional situations to a regular practice of biblical fellowship principles, those situations usually fall into the category of emergencies.\nI certainly do not want to diminish your desire to receive the Lord\u2019s Supper or downplay the preciousness of the sacrament, but we do speak of the gospel in word and sacrament. By that we mean that God offers and gives forgiveness of sins through the word alone and through the sacrament. If you are not able to receive the Lord\u2019s Supper as often as you would like, be assured that God offers and gives you the same spiritual blessings through his word alone as he does through the sacrament.\nIf you have not done so already, do speak to your pastor about your circumstances. He may be aware of one of our churches that is a little farther away than \u201cnearby\u201d when you are traveling. God bless you also."}

{"prompt": "Congregational activities and preaching", "completion": "In viewing many of the websites and social media accounts of various WELS churches, I've noticed many of them focusing on items like blood drives and \"National Hot Dog Day.\" It appears their preaching has also become more \"culturally sensitive\" with less emphasis on the text. At the same time we hear of our synod membership shrinking every year. Coincidence?\n\n\nI am not familiar with the websites you viewed. It looks like you came across information from congregations that planned community events as part of their outreach strategy.\nI cannot speak to pastors\u2019 treatment of sermon texts, since I do not have the information you do. What you can certainly do is contact pastors about the sermons they post online. Speaking to them first would be appropriate and scriptural.\nAs far as synodical statistics are concerned, a recent demographic survey identified the following factors that have contributed to a decline in membership in our synod:\n\u201cFamilies today are having fewer children.\n\u201cThe number of WELS members dying and going to heaven is increasing as the overall population ages.\n\u201cIt has grown increasingly difficult to retain members, especially younger members. Since 1986, WELS lost between 240,000-260,000 members through removal/excommunication or from those members joining other Christian churches. These are sometimes referred to as \u2018back door losses.\u2019\n\u201cFewer people are living in rural areas, and this is impacting more than 100 churches who now face the \u201850/60 challenge\u2019\u2014fewer than 50 people worship each week and the average age worshiping is above 60 years old.\u201d\nAs you and I think of membership in our individual congregations and in our synod, the following instruction can be helpful and productive: \u201cTherefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing\u201d (1 Thessalonians 5:11)."}
{"prompt": "WELS and LCMS pastors", "completion": "Prior to the fellowship split in 1961, were teachers and perhaps pastors from both WELS and LCMS, for a lack of a better term, interchangeable?\r\nIn other words, could an LCMS pastor or teacher accept a call to the WELS and vice versa?\r\nI'm almost 55 and grew up in the LCMS (later joining a WELS church in 1992 and been a member ever since). Recently, I learned that a teacher at the LCMS grade school I attended passed away.\r\nSo would I be correct to conclude without knowing his complete work history that he may have gone back and forth between the WELS and LCMS prior to the 1961 split?\r\nSo what happened to teachers and pastors that had LCMS upbringing and education were serving in the WELS right after the 1961 split? Were they grandfathered in or were they required to take some instructions at the various WELS colleges in order to keep their job? Now of course things are different so I don't know how the LCMS handles such things but I would imagine that an LCMS pastor that desires to be called to a WELS church would, in addition to becoming a member, be required to have extensive training at a WELS college and/or seminary first regardless of previous education in the LCMS system?\r\nAny help or correction would be appreciated since I'm very curious on both the current and historical practices.\r\n\n\n\nYour understanding of the \u201cinterchangeability\u201d of WELS and LCMS pastors\u2014and the teacher you had\u2014prior to 1961 is correct. When, prior to 1961, WELS and LCMS pastors accepted to calls to congregations beyond their synod, they became rostered clergy of that synod.\nYou are also correct in noting the importance and necessity of a colloquy process for an LCMS pastor who today desires to serve in WELS.\nWith your background, you may be interested in reading A Tale of Two Synods: Events That Led to the Split Between Wisconsin and Missouri.

{"prompt": "Comfort in time of loss", "completion": "Our young adult daughter was recently taken to her glory in heaven after extreme suffering.  What is it like for her now?  Is she with loved ones?  We miss her so terribly.  When will our tears stop?  We pray for peace.\n\n\nPlease accept my sympathy at the death of your daughter. Death was never part of God\u2019s design for his perfect creation. Death is \u201cthe wages of sin\u201d (Romans 6:23).\nWhat you and I are grateful for is that Jesus Christ has conquered death and that he has made death the means by which Christians enter the presence of God in heaven.\nYou are viewing your daughter\u2019s present circumstances correctly when you speak of her enjoying the glory of heaven (Psalm 73:24). We long for what she is experiencing. Her soul is with the souls of all those who confessed Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah, as Savior in this life. She will be among those who accompany the Lord when he returns visibly to this world on the Last Day (1 Thessalonians 4:14).\nYour tears, like mine at the death of a loved one, result when we think of our own lives and the temporary changes that have taken place. We can balance that emotion of sorrow with joy when we think of the glory and perfection that our loved ones are experiencing in the presence of God. Jesus promises to take care of your tears (Matthew 5:4; Revelation 7:17; 21:4).\nThe Lord provides comfort and strength for you and your family through the gospel in word and sacrament. I encourage you to feed your soul richly with the word of God. Be a frequent guest at the Lord\u2019s Supper. Through the gospel, God strengthens our faith and fortifies us for Christian living.\nTo help deal with your grief, perhaps there is a support group at your church you could consider attending. Certainly, seek out the counsel of your pastor.\n\u201cNow may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way. The Lord be with all of you\u201d (2 Thessalonians 3:16)."}
{"prompt": "God and life's events", "completion": "Does God remove people from our lives? I have a friend who has recently began using this as a means to comfort others or to rationalize when a relationship ends by saying that God was protecting them, or He is going to bring someone better into their lives, or they learned what He needed them to from that person and it time for them to move on. While God could certainly remove someone if he chose, the only place in the Bible I can think of God removing someone was with Phillip and the eunuch, but that is not the context in which she is using it. She is using it more in the context of divorce, rifts in families, the ending of friendships or romantic relationships. I'm at a loss of what to say to her since she fully believes that it is God's will and doing, yet it seems to contradict the Bible. \r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\nDo people come in and out of our lives in various ways and through different circumstances? Is God ultimately in control of all events in our lives? Does God promise to work all things in life for our good? The answer to all those questions is \u201cyes.\u201d\nThere is a problem when people try to assign a specific motive of God to a particular event in life. If God has not revealed in his word why he has or has not done something, we cannot pretend to speak for him.\nWhen it comes to the \u201cwhy?\u201d questions of life, I find it best to maintain the attitude expressed in Romans 11:33-36: \u201cOh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!

{"prompt": "Dealing with past sin", "completion": "My boyfriend, a Lutheran convert, is not a virgin and I am. I\u2019ve been struggling with this on and off for the duration of our relationship. He was very open, honest, and straightforward about his past, acknowledging his sin, his guilt, and his repentance from the very beginning of our courtship, in efforts to maintain transparency. I was surprised, and did not expect it, but I was/am appreciative of his honesty and told him so. I also explained to him that am forgiving of him and his past as modeled in the 5th petition of the Lord\u2019s Prayer. \r\nWe both value and recognize the importance of maintaining a sexually pure relationship and honoring the 6th Commandment. We have had many conversations about maintaining an appropriate level of ethical premarital activity and agree we will abstain from premarital sex. My struggle comes when I think about his past intimacy with the other women he\u2019s slept with. I realize sex is a gift God grants to a husband and a wife, it is a union of persons, and that it should be protected from being cheapened. It really upsets me to think that if/when we get married, that it no longer has the value that it did. I\u2019m bothered by the memories of others, and I\u2019m insecure because of the inevitable comparison to the past. I mostly feel hurt in a way that words cannot describe. \r\nI know he loves me, and he loves God. I know he is remorseful of his transgressions and would change the past if he could. But I don\u2019t know how to find peace and put this out of my mind. \n\n\nThere is no question in your words for me to address, but I can attempt to offer a brief response.\nFrom what I read, your boyfriend has confessed his sin and received the forgiveness of sins through faith. You also have expressed a forgiving attitude toward him. I commend you for that.\nYour reference to the Lord\u2019s Prayer is good and very applicable: as we have been forgiven, so we forgive others. When God forgives, he forgets (Jeremiah 31:34). We can forgive, but the memories of others\u2019 sins can linger in our minds. Our goal is to be more like God in forgetting the sins of others.\nWithout having any further information, your self-assessment of insecurity sounds plausible to me. Addressing this in a face-to-face conversation with your pastor or other trusted counselor would be the best approach. If you are not able to speak to your pastor about this, Christian Family Solutions, a WELS-affiliated ministry, offers in-person and video counseling.\nWhat will be helpful is remembering to view your boyfriend and yourself as redeemed children of God (Galatians 4:4-5; 1 John 3:1). God has determined your worth: you are precious in his sight (Isaiah 43:4). God bless you and your boyfriend."}
{"prompt": "The saving works of Jesus", "completion": "I understand that I deserve hell because I have sinned. I understand that there is no hope in being saved and going to heaven through works or good things that I can do. We are saved because Jesus has lived a perfect life, died in our place, and rose from the dead. But how exactly does that pay for our sins? If we deserve to suffer in hell for eternity, wouldn't Jesus have to be suffering in hell for eternity to pay for our sins? Did Jesus go to hell? I know that different people believe different things about where he went after he died and what he did there. Why did Jesus rise from the dead? Is this necessary for our salvation? Thank you.\n\n\nYou asked some very important questions about our salvation. You identified the all-important works of Jesus: his perfect life, sacrificial death and glorious resurrection.\nHow did those works pay for our sins? God\u2019s law demands that we be perfect in every way and at all times (Leviticus 19:2; Matthew 5:48). Jesus lived life perfectly in our place (Hebrews 4:15). Because we also deserved punishment from God for not living perfectly as he demands, Jesus suffered that punishment in our place (Galatians 3:10-13).\nOn the cross, Jesus suffered what amounts to hell: he was punished for sin and forsaken by God (Matthew 27:46). Rather than suffering eternally, the eternal punishment all people deserved was compressed into a few hours of suffering on the cross.\nJesus\u2019 resurrection was proof positive that his heavenly Father had accepted his perfect life and sacrificial death as the full payment for the sins of the world (Romans 4:25).\nAfter Jesus\u2019 body and soul were reunited in the grave, he descended into hell to proclaim his victory over sin, Satan and death (1 Peter 3:18-20). He did not descend into hell to suffer or to give people a second chance to believe in him.\nYes, we all deserved an eternity in hell because of our natural sinful condition and our actual sins. Praise be to God for promising and sending a Savior\u2014his Son, Jesus Christ\u2014to be our perfect substitute in life and our innocent substitute in death. Praise be to God for accepting his Son\u2019s works as the full payment for our salvation, as evidenced by Jesus\u2019 resurrection from the dead."}
{"prompt": "Prayer and doubt", "completion": "How can I be confident that God will answer my prayers, considering James 1:6-7? Every day in my life I am struggling with sin and temptation (especially sins of doubt). I realize that I cannot win this spiritual battle on my own, and that I need God\u2019s power to resist these temptations. But because I am struggling with the sin of doubt, James 1:6-7 makes it seem to me that God is not answering my prayers. I am sorry for my sins and I would really love a God of grace to forgive me, but for some reason there is something in me that doubts the whole Bible even to be true. Considering James 1:6-7, will God answer my prayers? Will he help me fight temptation? Am I misinterpreting this passage? Thanks.\r\n\n\n\nTo begin with, a God of grace has forgiven you (2 Corinthians 5:19; Romans 5:18-19; 1 John 2:2). Your words tell me that you recognize the forgiveness of sins you possess through faith in Jesus Christ.\nYour words also lead me to think of the man who approached Jesus one day and said, \u201cI do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!\u201d (Mark 9:24). That man spoke for you and me and Christians in general. We praise God the Holy Spirit for connecting us to Jesus Christ in saving faith, but we also recognize that there is always room for growth in our faith. The Holy Spirit uses the gospel in word and sacrament to nurture and strengthen our faith.\nIn James 1:6-7 the inspired writer is addressing the problem of praying but doubting: doubting that God will hear prayers and answer them. The doubts you have expressed are connected to biblical content: is the whole Bible true? The Bible answers that question.\nJesus said, \u201cYour word is truth\u201d (John 17:17). The Lord did not qualify that statement by saying that some or most of God\u2019s word is truth; he said all of God\u2019s word is truth. The Holy Spirit led the apostle Paul to underscore that statement: \u201cAll Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness\u201d (2 Timothy 3:16).\nGod desires to strengthen the faith he has created in you (Isaiah 42:3). He wants you to pray to him, and he has promised to hear and answer (Psalm 50:15). He has armed you to fight temptations (Ephesians 6:10-17).\nSo, keep using the means by which the Holy Spirit can strengthen your faith\u2014the Bible and the Lord\u2019s Supper. Remember your baptism by which God made you his own child. Speak to God regularly in prayer, knowing and believing that he will hear and answer in the best way and at the best time. God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Carnally minded", "completion": "Can carnally minded Christians be saved?\n\n\nChristians are not carnally minded. In Romans 8 the apostle Paul paints a contrast between people who are carnally minded and spiritually minded.\nWhat follows is the pertinent section of Romans 8 in the King James Version (that uses the word \u201ccarnal\u201d) and the same section in the New International Version:\n\u201cFor they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit. 6 For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. 7 Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. 8 So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.\u201d\n\u201cThose who live according to the flesh have their minds set on what the flesh desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires. 6 The mind governed by the flesh is death, but the mind governed by the Spirit is life and peace. 7 The mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God\u2019s law, nor can it do so. 8 Those who are in the realm of the flesh cannot please God.\u201d"}

God promises to bless faithful Christian management and use of his blessings.\nIn the context of Mark 4:25, God\u2019s blessings are connected to a faithful use of his word.\u00a0 \u201cConsider carefully what you hear,\u201d he continued. \u201cWith the measure you use, it will be measured to you\u2014and even more\u201d (Mark 4:24).\nWhen you and I use God\u2019s word faithfully, we can expect the Holy Spirit to use it to nurture and strengthen our faith, and to increase the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23) in our lives.\nOn the other hand, when people do not use God\u2019s word by reading it or hearing it, the time will come when it will be taken from them.\nAll this is reason why Jesus said, \u201cIf anyone has ears to hear, let them hear\u201d (Mark 4:23)."}
{"prompt": "Rebuke of sin", "completion": "I'm having a difficult time with a potential issue regarding those leading a worship service, including the pastoral office.  Hypothetically, if a worship leader (layperson - singing or playing) is actively playing a role in a congregation, but a member/multiple members know that the leader is involved in a continual sin (examples: living with someone outside of marriage, addiction issues) unbeknownst to other church leadership, how does one act?  If I'm helping to lead the service as well, do I use Matthew 18 and talk to them first, then with others?  Do I move swiftly to church leadership to address the issue?\r\n\r\nI've had conflicting advice given on this (yes - leaders in worship are held to the same standard as pastors, and no - we are all sinners, so let it go).  I don't like feeling like a tattle-tale, but I also don't like feeling smug like a Pharisee either.  It has given me anxiety for a long time, and I'd like some clarification on this from a WELS leader.  \r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n \n\n\nMatthew 18:15-20 provides direction for addressing sin in the lives of fellow Christians. That direction includes speaking to a fellow Christian individually and then widening the number of people involved if there is continued impenitence.\nWith your hypothetical situation, you would want to speak to the worship leader first\u2014individually and privately.

The book of James ends on this note: \u201cRemember this: Whoever turns a sinner from the error of their way will save them from death and cover over a multitude of sins\u201d (James 5:20).\nAs you and I would want a fellow Christian to rebuke us about our sins, so we want to have a similar attitude toward a fellow Christian who is \u201cinvolved in a continual sin,\u201d as you described the situation.

{"prompt": "Respecting leaders", "completion": "What does respect for leaders mean when some of them act like King Herod and Pontius Pilate?  I think it means more to be afraid of them. God put them there, but they became corrupt all on their own.  \n\n\nRespect for leaders means that we render obedience to the laws of the government, unless governmental laws command us to go against God\u2019s word (Acts 5:29).\nIt is interesting to note the historical context when the apostle Paul wrote Romans 13:1-2 (\u201cLet everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.\u201d) and the apostle Peter wrote 1 Peter 2:13-14, 17 (\u201cSubmit yourselves for the Lord\u2019s sake to every human authority: whether to the emperor, as the supreme authority, or to governors\u2026 honor the emperor\u201d).\nWhen those apostles wrote, Nero reigned as Roman emperor.

Yet, the directives of \u201cbe subject\u201d and \u201chonor\u201d applied even to him\u2014not because his life or actions generated respect, but because he filled a seat of authority God had established.\nToday, as always, there is a need to do what the apostle Paul wrote in another inspired letter: \u201cI urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people\u2014 for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness\u201d (1 Timothy 2:1-2)."}
{"prompt": "Committee chairman and decisions", "completion": "I am concerned with the leadership of our church council when it comes to decision making. I recently had a discussion with our board of education chairman and he stated that while he does serve as the board chairman, all decisions are made through him. He says that if the board has an idea that he personally disagrees with, he has no obligation to share it with the church council. Is this the right way to run a board? Why even have a board? I know some decisions need to be made quickly, but should there be parameters on what decisions are made solely by the chairman?\n\n\nIn one of the courses I teach, we examine the following leadership styles: dictatorial, authoritative, consultative and participative. While there can be instances where a church leader like a pastor needs to exhibit a dictatorial leadership style (for example, in the implementation of biblical doctrine and practice), such a regular leadership style is not compatible with the constitutions and by-laws of our congregations or biblical principles.\nThe chairman of a committee, like committee members, might have an opinion on a matter, but his opinion does not trump the opinions of others. The constitutions and by-laws of our congregations establish a democratic way of conducting business\u2014often citing the use of Robert\u2019s Rules of Order.\nBiblical principles (Proverbs 27:5; Matthew 18:15-17; Ephesians 4:15; 2 Timothy 3:16-17) guide you to speak to that committee chairman about his actions before you speak to others.

{"prompt": "Divorce and dating", "completion": "I have family member who is in the process of getting a divorce, meaning that they have months to face the judge and complete the process.  The family member wants to know that since the marriage contract was broken according to Scripture, do they still have to wait for the state divorce completion process or could they, if the right person comes along, start a new relationship?\n\n\nI am addressing this question with the understanding that the spouse of your family member created the reason for the divorce because of his or her sin.\nWhile God established marriage (Genesis 2:18-24; Matthew 19:4-6) and permits divorce for unfaithfulness (Matthew 19:9) and desertion (1 Corinthians 7:15), our government regulates marriage and divorce. Unfaithfulness and desertion can break the bond of marriage, but a dissolution of marriage is required to end the marriage legally.\nYour family member would do well to recognize the role of government in divorce and to act appropriately. In addition, your family member will want to keep in mind how his or her actions can affect others. Entering into a new relationship before the divorce is final could certainly raise questions in people\u2019s minds."}

If someone threatens my family, friends, or my own life, is it acceptable in God\u2019s eyes if the last resort means I have to take the person\u2019s life who is doing the threatening?  For example, what if someone breaks into my house, or if I am in a Walmart and another mass shooter walks in?\r\n\n\n\nThe Hebrew word in the Fifth Commandment (Exodus 20:13 and Deuteronomy 5:17) prohibits murder\u2014the illegal and inappropriate ending of human life\u2014and does not forbid all taking of life. So, for example, governments can rightly implement capital punishment (Romans 13:4) if they so choose.\nWhat about individuals who want to protect themselves and their families, you wonder? Some Christians look to Matthew 5:39 and Romans 12:17 as absolute directives not to resist physical threats. In their context though the verses advocate love toward others instead of seeking revenge.\nOthers look to sections of Scripture like Proverbs 24:11-12 and Luke 22:35-38 as the basis for defending oneself and one\u2019s family from physical threats.\nProtecting our own life (self-defense) could result in the death of another person. That is not murder. Exodus 22:2-3 illustrates the law God gave his people of Israel regarding defending oneself from a thief."}
{"prompt": "Appropriate Christian response", "completion": "What is the appropriate Christian response to a friend or family member who is pregnant outside of marriage (whether planned or unplanned)? The friend/family member intends to raise the child, and is by all accounts excited to have this baby. \r\nI know this child is a gift and blessing, but I'm having a difficult time knowing exactly how to respond in a loving way that doesn't condone the premarital relations.\n\n\nYour words demonstrate well that you have appropriate concern for the situation. You are seeking to differentiate between the mother and her actions, and the baby.\nWhat I do not know\u2014and perhaps you do not know either\u2014is whether there has been pastoral care involved in this situation. Have confession and absolution taken place? If they have, that can make your conversation more comfortable in the sense that you do not need to initiate subjects of sin and forgiveness in your conversation with the mother.\nIn all situations, we do want to speak the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15). With this situation, you would do well by spending a good deal of time listening to this friend/family member. Her words will give you direction for your own. Baptism plans for the baby would be an important part of a conversation with the mother. God bless your words and actions."}
{"prompt": "Beth Moore", "completion": "Beth Moore is very popular these days, and many churches like to use her works. Other than teaching men, what other heterodox issues are there with her teachings?\n\n\nI would have to read some of her books and materials to give a more thorough response. Her website did contain a brief statement of faith. It indicated a blurring of biblical fellowship principles.\nElsewhere on her website, there were these statements on \u201cLooking for Peace with God\u201d \u2013 \u201cWe must trust Jesus Christ and receive Him into our hearts by our personal invitation.\u201d \u201cThrough prayer, invite Jesus Christ to forgive your sins & be your Savior.\u201d\nDecision theology runs contrary to what the Bible teaches. By nature we are spiritually dead (Ephesians 2:1), spiritually blind (Acts 26:17-18) and enemies of God (Romans 8:6-7). Conversion is the work of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 12:3)."}
{"prompt": "New commentaries?", "completion": "Are there plans for the Synod to produce commentaries (like People's Bible series) to accompany the new EHV?\n\n\nMy own inquiry into this concluded that there are no current plans for such a series of commentaries."}
{"prompt": "Discontinuing medical treatment", "completion": "If you were to stop dialysis at age of 88, would that be committing suicide? \n\n\nThis is a question that you really want to address to your pastor. We want to recognize that life is a gift from God (Psalm 139:13-14) and that he alone (Psalm 31:15; 90:3)\u2014or his representatives in the government (Romans 13:4)\u2014has the right to end a person\u2019s life. Since God forbids the illicit taking of human life (Exodus 20:13), we do not want to do anything that has the specific purpose of shortening life.\nChristian Life Resources, a WELS-affiliated ministry, has numerous resources that can be helpful for you and your pastor.\nAgain, do contact your pastor and share with him your questions and concerns. God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Prayer and church fellowship", "completion": "If we as WELS Christians belong to the Universal Christian Church as we confess in the Apostles' Creed, why is it a sin for us to pray with our fellow brothers and sisters who might be of a different denomination or Lutheran synod?  Aren't we all Christians?  \n\n\nYour question illustrates the difference between the Holy Christian Church (the invisible Church) and visible churches.\nYou are correct in noting that we believe that there is a \u201cHoly Christian Church, the communion of saints,\u201d as we confess in the words of the Apostles\u2019 Creed. That Church consists of people throughout the world who have a common faith in Jesus Christ as their Savior. Because God alone knows what is in a person\u2019s heart (1 Samuel 16:7; 2 Timothy 2:19), we call that Church \u201cthe invisible Church.\u201d\nWhat is visible to you and me is where people have aligned themselves with their church membership. By joining a church, people have committed themselves to the doctrine and practice of that church. We cannot look into people\u2019s hearts and see what they believe, but people can tell us what is in their hearts by their words\u2014and their actions, by the doctrine they embrace via their church membership.\n\u201cAren\u2019t we all Christians?\u201d you wonder. Individuals and groupings of people might call themselves Christians and yet: deny the inspiration of the Bible, deny infant baptism, reject the real presence of the Lord\u2019s body and blood in the Lord\u2019s Supper, deny original sin, believe in a literal 1,000-year reign of Christ on earth, etc. False teachings like these are serious and, finally, can be threatening to saving faith. This is why Scripture teaches us not to practice church fellowship with those who believe or teach contrary to Scripture (Romans 16:17).\nWhen there is unity of faith with other Christians, then we can express that unity by praying together, receiving the Lord\u2019s Supper together and combining our resources for mission work and educational efforts. When unity of faith does not exist, we refrain from those joint activities.\nRefraining from those joint activities does not mean that we consider the people involved to be outside the Christian faith. Again, faith is a matter of the heart. God alone knows who belongs to his Church. Refraining from praying with people, for example, who call themselves Christians, results when we compare their church\u2019s teachings to the Bible\u2019s teachings and find that the teachings do not agree. Refraining might be challenging, but it is the right thing to do. It is a testimony to the truth of Scripture."}
{"prompt": "Devotion readers", "completion": "So I go to an area Lutheran high school, and every night we have devotion and students read them. So, I was wondering if it\u2019s okay to have females read the devotions at night?\n\n\nI do not know if you are inquiring about a present practice or an idea for the future. Regardless, you want to direct your question to the individuals at your school who have appropriate responsibility. Those people are best suited to know your circumstances and apply scriptural principles."}
{"prompt": "Conversation with son", "completion": "Good Morning: My wife and I are concerned that our son is being scammed and that the conversation we have with him will be very difficult and we fear that it will drive him away. Do you have any guidance on how to start the conversation? Thank you.\n\n\nOne of my challenges in responding to you is that I do not know what kind of relationship exists between you and your son, or even the age of your son. Regardless, I would still encourage an open and honest conversation.\nYou and your wife could begin by reaffirming your love and concern for your son. It is finally love and concern that are driving your desire to speak to him about (potential) danger. You could explain that you want the best for your son and do not want to see him get hurt in any way\u2014including being the victim of a scam.\nIf you do not have certain knowledge of what your son might be involved in, perhaps you could share with your son the information you do possess that leads you to be concerned about him. Your son could then react to that information: confirming or discounting it.\nNone of us can control how others will receive our words. What we can control is how we speak to others. In that regard, Scripture has much to say (for example, Ephesians 4:15; Colossians 4:6).\nSince your pastor knows your circumstances better than I do, seeking his guidance would be beneficial for you and your wife. God bless your conversation with your son."}
{"prompt": "Acts 2:38 and Baptism", "completion": "What if a person was baptized \"in the name of Jesus Christ\"?\r\nShould we understand from Acts 2: 38 that the apostles baptized like that, or not?\n\n\nA valid Baptism is the application of water \u201cin the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit\u201d (Matthew 28:19). Jesus instructed his followers to baptize in the name of the Triune God.\nActs 2:38 does not tell us that the disciples baptized with different wording, substituting \u201cin the name of Jesus\u201d for \u201cin the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.\u201d Acts 2:38 speaks of being baptized in the manner and by the authority of the one who instituted Baptism: Jesus Christ.\nDescribing Baptism \u201cin the name of Jesus Christ\u201d stresses the blessings that become one\u2019s own in Baptism: being clothed with the forgiveness of sins Jesus won by his holy life, sacrificial death and triumphant resurrection (Galatians 3:27)."}
{"prompt": "Time of Satan's rebellion", "completion": "When did Satan sin against God?\n\n\nSatan\u2019s rebellion against God took place between the events of Genesis 1 & 2 and Genesis 3.\nThe first two chapters of Genesis present the narrative of God creating a perfect world (Genesis 1:31). That perfect world included angels. Genesis 3 introduces us to Satan, who appeared in the form of a serpent (Revelation 20:2). All that can be said with certainty is that Satan sinned against God at some point after God created a perfect world.\nWhat a joy to know that Jesus defeated Satan (1 John 3:8) and freed us from his power."}
{"prompt": "Abraham's son", "completion": "Why in Genesis 22 does God refer to Isaac as Abraham's only son if Abraham already had Ishmael?\n\n\nYou ask an interesting question. Previously in Genesis, Ishmael is called Abraham\u2019s son (for example, 17:23-25; 21:11). Ishmael was Abraham\u2019s son through Hagar. Isaac later became Abraham\u2019s son through Sarah (Genesis 21:3). Before he used Old Testament history to make a point to the Galatian Christians, the apostle Paul noted that Abraham had two sons (Galatians 4:22).\nIn Genesis 21, we learn that Hagar and Sarah could not get along, so Abraham sent Hagar and Ishmael away. That means that Hagar and Ishmael were not at all in the picture when God instructed Abraham, in Genesis 22, to sacrifice his son. That explains God\u2019s command to Abraham: \u201cTake your son, your only son, whom you love\u2014Isaac\u2014and go to the region of Moriah\u201d (Genesis 22:2). The only son around Abraham at this time was Isaac. He was the one involved in the testing of Abraham\u2019s faith."}
{"prompt": "Living Waters Ministries", "completion": "I recently ran across two gentlemen named Ray Comfort and Kirk Cameron who are affiliated with Living Waters Church. I have listened to several of their YouTube videos and they seem to present law and gospel properly but, being a skeptical Lutheran, I have my doubts about their presentations. I know that there are Christians in other churches other than the WELS, but I am looking for some clarity in my thinking and belief.  What can you tell me about these men or their organization? Thank you for your consideration.  Your brother in Christ.\n\n\nRay Comfort is the founder and CEO of Living Waters ministries. Kirk Cameron is an actor who joined Comfort\u2019s ministry.\nThe Statement of Faith on Living Waters\u2019 website contains some good statements about the Christian faith. Some of the statements though reflect Comfort\u2019s previous affiliation with Calvary Chapel Fellowship. There are references to limited atonement, and there is a denial of the sacraments (they are called \u201csacred ordinances\u201d).\nOther literature on the website contains examples of decision theology and errors regarding the end times.\nYour question underscores the scriptural directive to \u201ctest the spirts\u201d (1 John 4:1)."}
{"prompt": "Support and aid", "completion": "How many ways does WELS reach beyond the synod to lend support and aid to people in need throughout the world?\n\n\nThe greatest amount of support and aid comes through WELS Christian Aid and Relief. Elsewhere on this website you can find this information: \u201cChristian Aid and Relief continues to work with the WELS Board for World Missions, our WELS Missionaries, our sister congregations of the Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference around the world, and the Board for Home Missions in funding humanitarian aid projects which reflect Christ\u2019s love to people in need and build bridges to proclaim the gospel.\u201d This link will enable you to read about some of the support and aid given to people in more than a dozen countries.\nIn addition, the 2019 Book of Reports and Memorials includes this information: \u201cIn 2017\u201318, $327,475 was granted for humanitarian aid projects. For 2018\u201319, $317,403 has been approved. Major items funded in our world mission fields include borehole drilling to provide clean water, English as a second language (ESL) classes, home-based care for the chronically ill and dying, food assistance to the needy, food and nutrition to orphans, serving people with special needs, skill training and care for women, technology training, and medical equipment and health clinics\u2026We thank our gracious Lord for moving the hearts of WELS members to show how much they care with their prayers and gifts of love\u201d (Page 72).\nAll this is a way of trying to do what Scripture instructs: \u201cTherefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers\u201d (Galatians 6:10).\nOf course, the greatest need people have is a Savior: Jesus Christ. A healthy percentage of our synod\u2019s ministry plan is allocated for home and world missions. We seek to carry out what Jesus said, \u201cTherefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you\u201d (Matthew 28:19-20)."}
{"prompt": "Jesus and the rich man", "completion": "Why did Christ reply to the rich man that He is no good, when we Christians believe He has never sinned? \n\n\nYou are correct: Jesus never sinned during his earthly life (2 Corinthians 5:21; Hebrews 4:15; 1 Peter 1:19). Jesus was perfect in our place.\nI am not sure which Bible reference you have in mind with your question. I am wondering if it could be Jesus\u2019 conversation with the rich man in Mark 10:17-22. In that conversation, Jesus told the man, \u201cNo one is good\u2014except God alone\u201d (Mark 10:18).\nJesus was restating the truth of Psalm 14:2-3 and Psalm 53:2-3: all people are sinners. The only one who is good\u2014in every sense of the word\u2014is God. As Jesus is God, his words to the rich man pointed to himself as God and Savior.\nI hope I have come close to answering your question."}
{"prompt": "Marry or not marry", "completion": "I hear a lot of talk about this so called \"gift of singleness.\" Does such a gift exist? Does God choose if we can marry or do we choose? And if someone does have this gift and still decides to marry, is it a sin? \n\n\nIn 1 Corinthians 7:7 the apostle Paul speaks of the gift of self-control that God gave him. That gift enabled him to remain single and chaste. Christians today can have that gift from God.\nGod certainly knows who will marry or remain single, but he allows people to make those choices in life.\nBy merely deciding to marry, a person will not be guilty of sin. 1 Corinthians 7 explains that Christians are free to marry or not marry."}
{"prompt": "Communication to Christians", "completion": "A friend recently told me how, just before she would have gotten into an auto accident, she heard the voice of her mother, who had died some years before, telling her, \"(Name), stop!!\"  I told her that this could have been a guardian angel sent by God to keep her safe, using the remembered voice of her mother.  When an angel told Joseph that Mary would be the mother of our Lord, we can only speculate what form or voice the angel used.  If a person near death reports having actual communication with a departed loved one, could we suggest another possibility, that this could have been a vision of an angel - if whatever \"message\" was given didn't in any way contradict any truth of God?  \n\n\nHaving no firsthand knowledge of the close call your friend experienced, I cannot offer any comments of substance. You are correct in noting that we can merely speculate on the way the angel spoke to Joseph in a dream (Matthew 1:18-25).\nWhen it comes to your question of near-death communications, Christians readily acknowledge that God can do anything. So, if God used angels to communicate with people in biblical days, he certainly can do something similar today. The difficulty for you and me can be knowing the difference between what God can do and what actually took place in someone\u2019s life. In so many circumstances and situations in life, we simply acknowledge, in faith and humility, the immense wisdom and knowledge of God (Romans 11:33-36). In addition, we praise God for communicating with us clearly in his word, the Bible (2 Timothy 3:15-16)."}
{"prompt": "Creation/Ark Museums", "completion": "Recently, I asked a question and received my answer. Thank you.  However, I have another concern about something I ran into this summer.  My wife and I went to the creation/ark museums in Kentucky. The experience was great and revealing.  My concern is what can you tell me about Ken Ham and the creation/ark museums as they relate to God's word and our doctrine? My concern is that the entire presentation seems to be law oriented with Christ sprinkled throughout.  Your servant in Christ.\n\n\nA predecessor in my position offered this general overview of Ham\u2019s theology: \u201cKen Ham defends the doctrine of creation against evolution\u2026Since his main purpose is to defend the truthfulness of Genesis, his site does not give much indication about his position on such topics as the sacraments and the millennium. He does uphold basic doctrines such as the Trinity, the virgin birth, and so on. A quick tour of his site suggests he focuses on fundamental doctrines and does not deal specifically with controversial doctrines, since this is not his purpose.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Online courses", "completion": "I am attempting to ease back into my (unwillingly) interrupted education via the Hillsdale online courses. Are you familiar with these, and, if so, are you aware of anything specific for which one needs to watch out? Given that it was founded by Baptists, its theological lectures I am approaching with caution, and will be referring back to WELS doctrine through such resources as the WLS Essay Files, to counteract the influence of false teaching. I would skip them altogether but for the fact that some of its alumni are amongst those influencing national life, and it is useful to know why they think what they think. But its theology understandably permeates its other courses, and there its influence is more difficult to detect. A liberal alternative, assuming one existed, would not suit my purposes. I wouldn't trust its accuracy, for one thing, and, last I looked, neither the WELS nor the ELS offer anything comparable. Any advice you can give me would be very much appreciated. Thank you!\n\n\nI cannot say that I am familiar with that college\u2019s offering of online theology courses. It looks like you have the right approach if you were to enroll in some of their courses: to be aware of the college\u2019s historical, religious background, to view and read materials as one \u201ctesting the spirits\u201d (1 John 4:1) and to utilize the resources available from your church and church body.\nAnother good resource from your church would be your pastor. He could be in a position to help you sort out biblical teaching from error.\nOn the college\u2019s website, there is information like this: \u201cAs a nonsectarian Christian institution, Hillsdale College maintains \u2018by precept and example\u2019 the immemorial teachings and practices of the Christian faith.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t have mandatory chapel, faith statement, or an affiliation with a particular denomination.\u201d With general statements like those, you would probably want to be on the lookout for items like decision theology, legalism, a denial of the sacraments and a watering down of biblical fellowship principles.\nI do not know which theology courses are of interest you, but I do want to make you aware that Martin Luther College offers three Bible courses and three doctrine courses online. All courses are offered every summer. All courses are also offered during the academic school year on a rotational basis. This link will take you to the Continuing Education section of Martin Luther College\u2019s website, where you can find more information about these courses.\nI wish you well!"}
{"prompt": "1 Corinthians 11:7", "completion": "What does it means in 1 Corinthians 11:7 that woman is the image or glory of man?\n\n\nIt is helpful to look at the verse you cited in its immediate context.\nIn 1 Corinthians 11:3, God states a principle regarding headship. The following three verses provide applications of that principle that are set in the worship customs of the Christians in Corinth. Then, 1 Corinthians 11:7 lists the reason for those applications: God created woman from man and for man\u2014to be a suitable helper for him (Genesis 2:18). Woman is the glory of man in that sense.\nNone of this affects man\u2019s or woman\u2019s status before God. Genesis 1:27 states that God created Adam and Eve in his image. Being created in the image of God meant that Adam and Eve were holy, they had perfect knowledge of God\u2019s will, and their wills were entirely aligned with God\u2019s will. Galatians 3:26-28 declares that even though differences exist among Christians, including differences of gender, there is perfect equality among all Christians before God."}
{"prompt": "Judas and hell", "completion": "In a recent sermon a pastor said \"Judas is burning in hell.\"  Judas did commit suicide, Jesus said it would have been better if his betrayer had not been born, and Acts 1:24 implies that Judas may be in hell. Can it be definitively said, from Scripture, that Judas is in hell?  \r\nThanks for this resource and your faithfulness in answering the questions for all these years!\n\n\nThere is no Bible passage that states explicitly: \u201cJudas is in hell.\u201d The wording of Acts 1:25 gives reason to believe that Judas died in impenitence and belief when it says that he left his ministry \u201cto go where he belongs.\u201d That is not the kind of wording one would associate with a person who died in saving faith. Also, there is more reason for concern when we keep in mind that \u201cSatan entered Judas\u201d (Luke 22:3) not long before Judas took his life.\n\u2014 Thank you for your kind words. The Q & A work is a humbling privilege and opportunity to serve the Lord and people."}
{"prompt": "Troubles and the Christian life", "completion": "I'm suffering from terrible illness. No help from doctors and my family left me. Why should I believe in God?\n\n\nI am saddened to hear of your situation, and I trust you are in contact with your pastor. He is in a position to serve you with God\u2019s gospel in word and sacrament.\nWhen troubles in life come along, Satan would like nothing more than for Christians to conclude that God is powerless and/or unloving. Job in the Old Testament could have wrongly reached that conclusion when he faced disasters in his life. In the midst of calamities\u2014and at all other times of Job\u2019s life\u2014God remained all-powerful and all-loving. God did not love Job any less when his life became problem-filled. Job was simply unaware of God\u2019s workings in his life and God\u2019s purposes for his life when troubles came along. In your life and mine, God remains powerful and loving even when, and especially when, we face troubles and disappointments.\nI would encourage you to remember your Baptism. Regardless of the message life\u2019s circumstances might convey to you, Baptism tells you and me that we are God\u2019s children (Galatians 3:26-27).\nI encourage you to turn to Scripture to read about God\u2019s faithful love for you (Isaiah 54:10; Hebrews 13:5). The God who speaks of his love for you cannot lie (Numbers 23:19). He always speaks the truth.\nI encourage you to be a frequent guest at the Lord\u2019s Supper to receive rest for your soul (Matthew 11:28) through the forgiveness of sins.\nIt is important to use God\u2019s gospel in word and sacrament because that is what the Holy Spirit uses to bring the blessings of forgiveness and salvation into our lives. The gospel is also what the Holy Spirit uses to strengthen us for Christian living and to ward off the attacks of the devil (Ephesians 6:10-17). It is important to nourish and maintain Christian faith because the absence of it means eternal woes (Mark 16:16).\nAgain, do speak to your pastor and stay in regular contact with him. \u201cMay the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit\u201d (Romans 15:13). God bless you."}

Phrases in the Apostles\u2019 Creed list other events that are part of the Lord\u2019s state of exaltation: his descent into hell, his ascension, his sitting at the right hand of God the Father and his visible return to the world on the Last Day to judge all people."}

Not at all, but they have someone who lived perfectly in their place: Jesus (Hebrews 4:15). As children of God, Christians still have a sinful nature and struggle against it (Romans 7:15-25). Sometimes the sinful nature gets the better of Christians. When that happens, Christians confess their sins to God, receive God\u2019s message of forgiveness in faith and resolve to fight against sin all the more.\nIt is finally impenitence (1 Corinthians 6:9-10) and unbelief (Mark 16:16) that exclude people from the kingdom of God.\nFaith in Christ saves (Mark 16:16)."}

{"prompt": "Our heavenly home", "completion": "Is there a Bible verse that relates to the hymn \"I am but a stranger here, heaven is my home\"?\n\n\nHere are some Bible passages that come to mind. The first one especially speaks of heaven as our home.\n\u201cBut our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ\u201d (Philippians 3:20).\n\u201cDear friends, I urge you, as foreigners and exiles, to abstain from sinful desires, which wage war against your soul\u201d (1 Peter 2:11).\n\u201cAll these people were still living by faith when they died. They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance, admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on earth. People who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own. If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had opportunity to return. Instead, they were longing for a better country\u2014a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them\u201d (Hebrews 11:13-16).\n\u201cFor here we do not have an enduring city, but we are looking for the city that is to come\u201d (Hebrews 13:14).\n\u201cHear my prayer, LORD, listen to my cry for help; do not be deaf to my weeping.

{"prompt": "Living beings", "completion": "Regarding your answer on whether or not animals have souls, I can't believe that it is biblical to say that animals don't have souls. Genesis 1, 2 and 9 refer to animals by the Hebrew word for soul, which is nephesh.  The word nephesh is translated into Greek in the Septuagint as psyche, which is also used in the New Testament to refer to soul.  The Bible also says that animals have ruach, which is Hebrew for spirit.  Surely, animals have souls (and spirits), don't they? \n\n\nThe answer to another question, similar to yours, will offer further explanation.\n\u201cThe words in the Hebrew of the Old Testament and the Greek of the New Testament that are commonly translated into English as \u2018soul\u2019 are somewhat generic words, indicating the non-material part of human beings and other creatures. Their precise meaning at a given place must be drawn from their context in the Bible text and from related statements on the same subject also drawn from the Bible itself. The Bible clearly ascribes to animals a \u2018soul\u2019 in the sense of immaterial part of their being, the \u2018animating\u2019 quality that makes them a \u2018living being\u2019 in their bodies. This frequent use of the term (for mankind or animals) is almost identical with \u2018life, breath of life, inner life.\u2019\n\u201cThroughout Scripture, however, there is no evidence or hint that animals have an immortal \u2018soul/spirit\u2019 that relates or communicates distinctively with God. This quality, with parallel Bible vocabulary words used to indicate it, is limited to mankind. Animals were not created in the image of God, do not bear moral responsibility, do not sin, are never pointed to Christ\u2019s work for forgiveness, are not invited or urged to seek restoration of spiritual and eternal life in Christ, and are never said to face divine judgment, etc.\u201d (The question and answer that you referenced centered on the content of this paragraph.)"}
{"prompt": "St. Michael", "completion": "Why is the archangel Michael referred to as \"Saint Michael\" in our writings and hymns?\n\n\nYour question is very appropriate and understandable. The Christian Church has called the archangel Michael \u201cSaint Michael\u201d or \u201cSt. Michael\u201d for centuries.\nA saint is someone who is holy in the sight of God (Romans 1:7; 1 Corinthians 1:2). Since the Bible speaks of holy angels (Mark 8:38; Jude 14; Revelation 14:10), \u201csaint\u201d is a word that can be attributed to them. (Not all the angels remained holy \u2013 2 Peter 2:4.)\nThe minor festival of St. Michael and All Angels provides Christians with an opportunity to praise God for using his holy angels to protect them (Hebrews 1:14)."}
{"prompt": "Hair and head coverings", "completion": "The Bible speaks of women covering their heads in worship or prayer to show honor to their husbands and avoid offending the angels present in our worship services. Why doesn't WELS go by that instruction to the church by the Holy Spirit?\n\n\nThe short answer is that we are not the Christian congregation in Corinth in the first century A.D.\n1 Corinthians 11, the apostle Paul was speaking of a custom or practice that existed in the city of Corinth. The practice included women having long hair or wearing head coverings and men having short hair or not covering their heads. In the everyday, pagan culture of Corinth, men and women adorned themselves this way because they recognized the different roles of men and women. They came to that recognition not on the basis of Scripture, which they rejected, but from the natural differences that they observed between men and women.\nThe directive in 1 Corinthians 11 was that the Christian women in Corinth not be social renegades by disregarding what their heathen counterparts were doing, but be living examples of biblical principles regarding men and women (1 Corinthians 11:3). By mirroring cultural practices that were occasioned by the natural knowledge of God and conscience, the Christian women of Corinth could reinforce that knowledge and display their faith so others could be positively influenced (Matthew 5:16).\nIn 1 Corinthians 11:16, the apostle Paul identified the head coverings of the Christian women in Corinth as a \u201cpractice\u201d or custom: \u201cIf anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice\u2014nor do the churches of God.\u201d In the original Greek, \u201cother\u201d is really \u201csuch.\u201d The apostle explains that the hair/head covering situation in Corinth was a local practice and not compulsory for all Christian women of all time. That explanation also includes men and what was said about their long hair.\nA local practice or custom is far different from a universal principle from God, binding all women of all time to do the same. Because the Bible limits the instruction of head coverings to the women of Corinth in the first century by calling this a \u201cpractice,\u201d women of other places and times are not bound to follow that instruction."}
{"prompt": "Teaching and fellowship principles", "completion": "I have a friend of mine who is interested in attending our church and wants to know more about being WELS.  Just one snag, she teaches 7-8 grade at a Roman Catholic school, but only the subjects of English and Math, and does not teach religion.  If she joined the WELS, would she have to quit her job at the school?  Thank you in advance!\n\n\nThis is something you and your friend will want to pursue with your pastor. He is in a position to receive more complete information and help you answer questions like these: Would that situation be wrong? Is it wise?\nIn the meantime, it would likely be helpful for you and your friend to study biblical fellowship principles. Church Fellowship\u2014Working Together for the Truth is a book that can lead you through a study and application of those principles. The book is available from Northwestern Publishing House. Here is a pertinent section from that book: \u201cOur members are sometimes employed by churches, religious schools, or institutions affiliated with a church. Many of these jobs, such as janitorial or secretarial work and food service jobs, usually involve no religious fellowship. Our churches and schools sometimes employ non-members in such positions. Civil rights laws requiring nondiscrimination in hiring may also come into play in some of these cases.\n\u201cOther jobs, such as teaching or musical leadership, may involve a worker in the religious ministry of the church or may require participation in worship. Accepting such a job would then involve a compromise of fellowship principles.\n\u201cOther cases may be unclear, such as some teaching or coaching positions. In such cases a person should examine each situation on its own merits or demerits. How does the employer define the job? What are the requirements of the job? We cannot necessarily assume that the requirements of the position are the same as they would be for a similar position in our churches.\n\u201cAmbiguous situations are sometimes a matter of judgment. Two Christians in very similar circumstances may come to different conclusions. As stated earlier, in such situations we should be cautious about judging the decisions made by others. Doubtful cases are not a wise place to exercise church discipline.\u201d\nThe preceding thoughts can give you something to think about. Again, do contact your pastor."}
{"prompt": "The Holy Spirit and prayer", "completion": "Should you pray to the Holy Spirit?\n\n\nWe do pray to the Holy Spirit when we pray to God. A prayer to the Triune God is a prayer to the Holy Spirit.\nCan we address a prayer specifically to the Holy Spirit? Certainly. For example, we do that in our churches on Pentecost Sunday. This is the Prayer of the Day for that festival: \u201cHoly Spirit, God and Lord, come to us this joyful day with your sevenfold gift of grace. Rekindle in our hearts the holy fire of your love that in a true and living faith we may tell abroad the glory of our Savior, Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns with you and the Father, one God, now and forever. Amen.\u201d\nRomans 8:26-27 teaches that the Holy Spirit is very much involved in our prayer life. Along with the Father and the Son, the Holy Spirit hears and answers our prayers in wisdom and love."}
{"prompt": "Appearance of Adam and Eve", "completion": "What did Adam & Eve look like?  \n\n\nWe have no way of knowing what Adam and Eve looked like outwardly. We know that God created them in his image (Genesis 1:27), but that speaks of Adam and Eve\u2019s holiness, their knowledge of God\u2019s will and the fact that their wills were entirely aligned with God\u2019s will.\nOne day we will see Adam and Eve, and then we will have the answer to this question!"}
{"prompt": "Attitudes toward sin and good works", "completion": "Growing up in WELS churches, I have been told many times that we are saved by Christ alone and not by our own works. I have also been taught that we should live lives of thanksgiving and love to God in everything that we do. I have heard about spiritual apathy, not truly being sorry for our sins, receiving Communion unworthily, and not truly desiring forgiveness. These teachings have caused me much stress and confusion because they seem to be opposite things. How can I balance serving God in all I do with not being self-righteous? Ephesians 2:8-9 comfortingly shows us that our salvation is not at all in our hands. However, Matthew 7:21 states that only the one who does the will of God the Father will go to heaven. How do I balance not being work righteous with not becoming sinful with spiritual apathy? Also, I have heard that we need to confess our sins and repent to be saved. Is this true? Isn\u2019t confessing sins and repenting a work? Many times in my life I have tried to confess my sins, but I just don\u2019t feel truly sorry. What happens then? Why don\u2019t I feel sorry? Do we need to repent after every time we notice that we have sinned, or should we just have faith that the sin is forgiven? How often do we need to repent?  Thank you so much for all your time spent on this. I have been struggling with this problem for a very long time, and it is driving me crazy. I will appreciate any help that you can give me.\n\n\nYou have been taught well that God alone is responsible for your salvation and that your grateful response, moved by the Holy Spirit, is a life lived to the glory of God (2 Corinthians 5:15). I will try to respond to your questions as you listed them.\nWhen you wonder about serving God and not being self-righteous, you are illustrating what Christians are like. Our new self desires to use life God\u2019s way (Ephesians 4:24), while our old self\u2014our sinful nature\u2014seeks to use life selfishly and sinfully. As the apostle Paul demonstrated (Romans 7:15-25), there is reason for a constant struggle in a Christian\u2019s life between humbly serving God and being self-righteous\u2014in the context of your question.\nWhen it comes to not being work-righteous or spiritually apathetic, the key is the motivation behind what we do in life. As Christians, we try to keep God\u2019s law. Our motive is not to earn anything from God. Salvation is a gift. Our motive is to thank and praise God for his gift of salvation. We strive to carry out Galatians 6:10 (\u201cTherefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.\u201d), but the motive is gratitude not work righteousness.\nConfession and absolution are very important. 1 John 1:8-10 contrasts confession and impenitence. Galatians 5:19-21 and 1 Corinthians 6:9-11 teach that impenitence bars people from the kingdom of God.\nConfessing sins is a work, yes, but it is God\u2019s work in us. God uses his holy law to lead us to confess our sins (Psalm 19:2; Romans 3:19-20; James 2:10).\nConfessing our sins is an ongoing activity for Christians. Think of what Martin Luther wrote in his Small Catechism: \u201cBefore God we should plead guilty of all sins, even those we are not aware of, as we do in the Lord\u2019s Prayer.\u201d Recall the very first of Luther\u2019s 95 Theses: \u201cWhen our Lord and Master Jesus Christ said, \u2018Repent\u2019 [Matthew 4:17], he willed the entire life of believers to be one of repentance.\u201d\nYour concern about motivation for godly living, sin and confession is good. I would encourage you to focus more on Jesus, your Savior. Take the focus off yourself, wondering if your actions are pleasing to God or your confession of sins is genuine and sufficient. Look to Jesus. He has the words of eternal life (John 6:68). He deals gently with us (Matthew 12:20) and seeks to deepen our faith and trust in him through the gospel.\nI hope this has given you some help. Do follow up with your pastor as needed. God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Desire for wealth", "completion": "Can a Christian desire to be rich?\n\n\nWealth, in and of itself, is not evil. It is the value that people place on wealth that can make it evil. It is a first commandment issue when wealth becomes more important than God (Exodus 23:3; Matthew 6:24).\nConsidering what the Bible says about \u201clove of money\u201d (1 Timothy 6:10), a desire to be rich\u2014however that is defined\u2014is a risky desire.\nA man by the name of Agur understood life well when he wrote, \u201cGive me neither poverty nor riches, but give me only my daily bread\u201d (Proverbs 30:8). Contentment \u201cin any and every situation\u201d (Philippians 4:12) is our goal."}
{"prompt": "Dungeons and Dragons", "completion": "Is it O.K. to play \"Dungeons & Dragons\"?\n\n\nI can pass along a previous response to a similar question.\n\u201cWe cannot say role playing games are wrong in and of themselves. They would fall into the area of what is called adiaphora, that is, things that Scripture does not command nor forbid.\n\u201cHowever, when it comes to Dungeons and Dragons, there are some issues that Christians would want to consider. In her book, The Truth About Dungeons and Dragons, Joan Hake Robie points out that besides promoting sex and violence, the game also dabbles with spirits and promotes the occult.\n\u201cAnother book, Angels and Demons: Have Wings Will Travel, describes how the game works: \u2018The key person is the Dungeon Master, who creates a dungeon. The goal of other players is to work their way through an elaborate maze filled with monsters and creatures in order to seize hidden treasure. To accomplish this, the players must resort to many different tactics, including murder, rape, and casting evil spells. Even though these actions are only imaginary, the players become acquainted with occult rituals and creatures\u2019 (pp. 67, 68).\n\u201cAlthough some of these same elements may be found in other games, including some video games, the Christian will want to consider whether this is a best use of his or her leisure time. In Philippians 4:8 the apostle Paul tells us, \u2018Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable\u2013if anything is excellent or praiseworthy\u2013think about such things.\u2019\n\u201cAnother issue is that Dungeons and Dragons is sometimes the first step toward being involved in the occult. In the book, The Edge of Evil, Jerry Johnson warns, \u2018Those who have come out of the occult tell us that Dungeons and Dragons is one of the most comprehensive and effective training manuals used to prepare young people for entrance into the occult (p. 106).\n\u201cAs we use our Christian discretion in areas of entertainment, the wise thing is that we exercise good Christian judgment. This will serve us much better than compiling a list of acceptable or not acceptable games.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "God and sin", "completion": "Why would God allow Eve to be tempted when he knew what the outcome would be?  Would you allow your own child be in a situation where you knew the outcome would be terrible?  I would never have my child come to harm if I could have prevented it.  Why would God do that?  \n\n\nYour questions are ones that people have asked frequently over the years.\nBecause sin entered God\u2019s perfect world, some people have questioned God\u2019s power, as if he had no ability to prevent sin from entering the world. God is all-powerful (Job 42:2; Psalm 115:3; Matthew 19:26). He could have prevented sin from entering this world.\nBecause sin entered God\u2019s perfect world, other people have questioned God\u2019s love: \u201cWhy would a loving God do that?\u201d God is love (1 John 4:8). In his love and wisdom (Romans 16:27), God allowed sin to enter his perfect world.\nIn the Bible, God does not explain why he did not prevent sin from ruining his creation\u2014nor is God obligated to provide an explanation.\nQuestions about God and why he did or did not do something about the origin of evil need to be addressed in light of passages like these: \u201cOh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out! \u201cWho has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?\u201d \u201cWho has ever given to God, that God should repay them?\u201d For from him and through him and for him are all things. To him be the glory forever! Amen.\u201d (Romans 11:33-36) \u201cFor my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,\u201d declares the LORD. \u201cAs the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts\u201d (Isaiah 55:8-9). God always acts wisely, and his wisdom far surpasses our understanding. God\u2019s ways may be mysterious to us, but his ways are always right.\nYour question and statement about earthly parents and children remind me what God, in love, did to solve the problems sin created: \u201cFor God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life\u201d (John 3:16). \u201cThis is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins\u201d (1 John 4:10). When sin threatened our eternities, God stepped into action, sending his one and only Son, to be our perfect Savior in life and in death. God did what no earthly parent could have done. For that, we are eternally grateful."}
{"prompt": "Law and gospel", "completion": "How do you reconcile John 10:27-29 with Luke 8:11-15?\n\n\nIn John 10:27-29, Jesus comforts his followers by assuring them that they are safe and secure in his hands. In Luke 8:11-15, Jesus explains that people can fall from faith (v. 13).\nThe sections of Scripture you cited illustrate how God\u2019s law warns (Luke 8:13) and God\u2019s gospel comforts (John 10:27-29). Because Christians have a sinful nature and a new self, there is reason to hear and pay attention to both messages. If we become complacent in our spiritual lives, there is reason to listen to God\u2019s warning about falling from faith. If we are fearful about the future, there is reason to listen to God\u2019s comforting message of his powerful love.\nAs far as \u201creconciling\u201d the message of the law and gospel, Scripture teaches that these doctrines are different but not contradictory. Above all, the law shows our need for a Savior, and the gospel shows us the Savior we have in Jesus Christ."}
{"prompt": "Number from Revelation", "completion": "Recently a family member came to me and said the real number of man is 616 not 666.  Not only do I not understand where that came from, but can you explain to me how I would talk with them about that?  I don't appear to understand if it is a literal number or figurative.  Thank you.\n\n\nYour family member was referencing Revelation 13:18: \u201cThis calls for wisdom. Let the person who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. That number is 666.\u201d\nRevelation 13:11-18 describes a beast from the earth who is allied with Satan. Among the descriptions of that beast is a number: 666. As 7 is a number in Revelation that involves God, 6 describes the beast as falling short of God. Revelation uses numbers in a figurative sense.\nBe aware that the original manuscripts of the books of the Bible are no longer extant. Instead, we have copies and copies of the original manuscripts. The accuracy of the copyists was great, but variants do exist. Revelation 13:18 is one of those places. Most manuscripts favor 666. There are a few manuscripts that have 616.\nThe People\u2019s Bible commentary on Revelation would offer a more complete explanation of this and many more end-time topics.

{"prompt": "God's blessings on Christians", "completion": "I'm assured that my salvation and place in heaven comes by the grace of God alone, through faith alone, through Christ's blood alone, and that I can offer nothing to God that will impact my salvation in the tiniest bit. That said, I'm curious as to how other Scripture such as the parable of the talents, and Matthew 6:19-20 fit into that. Put another way, if two people both have saving faith and have their place in heaven secured, are the rewards in heaven different for each of them depending on the fruits of the Spirit each has borne in their period of grace? When Jesus says to store \"treasures in heaven,\" Jesus is so infinitely precise with his Word that He can't be merely saying secure your place in heaven, right? Or is He? He also said, \"Anyone who wants to be first must be the very last,\" implying it is possible to be \"first\" or high up in heaven.\r\n\r\nI very much understand that to be last in heaven is still infinitely better than being first on earth, but I'd like to know more since Jesus spoke several times regarding apparent difference of rewards in heaven.\r\n\r\nI am guessing this is an enormous topic, so if you can point me to a good resource or Bible study, please do so. Thank you for all of your work for the Kingdom!\n\n\nAs you noted, people enjoy salvation by God\u2019s grace through faith in Jesus Christ. We cannot contribute to the salvation that Jesus has won for us (Titus 3:4-6). The parable of the workers in the vineyard (Matthew 20:1-16) teaches that the gift of salvation is the same for all Christians, regardless of what stage of life they entered God\u2019s kingdom through conversion.\nWhile Christians enjoy salvation equally, there are Bible passages like Daniel 12:3; Matthew 25:23, 28-29; Luke 19:17, 19; 1 Corinthians 3:12-15; 2 Corinthians 9:6; and, Revelation 14:13 that speak of God graciously blessing his followers in proportion to their lives of sanctification. This action on God\u2019s part is due entirely to his gracious love; Christians do not earn or merit any blessings from God. While there are differences in these blessings, all Christians enjoy equally God\u2019s gift of salvation (Romans 6:23).\nTo read more about the Christian life, you might consider Sanctification: Alive in Christ. It is available from Northwestern Publishing House.\nJesus\u2019 words about storing up treasures in heaven direct us to seek first God\u2019s kingdom and righteousness (Matthew 6:33).\n\u2014 And thank you for your kind words."}
{"prompt": "\"Good luck\"", "completion": "How should I react to someone saying, \"Good luck,\" to me? I don't believe in luck. I feel God is in control of everything, and chance doesn't fit into the equation.\n\n\nOne approach could be to thank the person for his or her concern and then briefly explain that \u201cluck\u201d might be for other people, but you go through life with God at your side: he watches over you and works everything for your good (Romans 8:28).\nYour question illustrates how Christians can find witnessing opportunities in the littlest of everyday conversations.

{"prompt": "High school Christmas concert", "completion": "Is it OK for a WELS member to play his instrument in his public high school Christmas concert if they play religious songs, or does it break the teaching of church fellowship? Please give me a yes or no answer and why. Thank you!\n\n\nWith the information you provided, I can say that the people involved in concerts like this usually and generally agree that the setting is not a worship setting, where we would apply biblical fellowship principles.\nStill, something to be considered are the consciences of those involved. If someone views participation as sinful, then that person needs to refrain from participating. It is wrong to act against conscience (Romans 14:23).\nYou would do well to present more information about the concert to your pastor and seek his guidance."}
{"prompt": "Sexuality and Christian faith", "completion": "Artists like Madonna and Prince have many times drawn comparisons between sexuality and Christian faith (e.g. \"Like a Prayer,\" etc.). Is it blasphemous to make such comparisons?\n\n\nBlasphemy is an appropriate word to use in the comparison you cited. From what I learned about the lyrics of that song, one line in particular prompted charges of blasphemy. It is my understanding that the music video that accompanied the song clearly contained blasphemous content.\nThe book of the Bible we know as Song of Songs describes the love between a man and a woman, and symbolizes the love between God and the Christian Church. In Ephesians 5:21-33, the Holy Spirit led the apostle Paul to use the relationship between Jesus and the Christian Church as the pattern of marriage between a man and a woman. When Paul spoke of \u201clove\u201d in that relationship, he used the Greek word \u201cagape.\u201d That love desires the best for another person and is not self-seeking. Another Greek word for love is \u201ceros.\u201d That love seeks to possess and is associated with eroticism. It is significant that Bible writers did not use that word to describe the relationship between Christ and his Church.\nYour question illustrates how popular culture, including music, often fails to uphold moral standards. When it comes to entertainment, the Bible\u2019s instruction is always applicable: \u201cFinally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable\u2014if anything is excellent or praiseworthy\u2014think about such things\u201d (Philippians 4:8)."}

Will heaven be better than this life on earth?\n\n\nThe teaching you received was not accurate. The Bible makes it clear that our present life as Christians cannot begin to be compared with the glorious life that awaits us (Romans 8:18).\nEven though we presently enjoy God\u2019s forgiving love and have the status of his sons and daughters (1 John 3:1), we struggle against sin and temptation. We live in a world that is affected by sin.\nThe life that awaits Christians is one that is entirely free of sin and its effects (Revelation 7:16; 21:4).\nYes, heaven will be better than this life on earth\u2014infinitely better. That is why the Christian Church longs for that life and prays in regard to the Lord\u2019s visible return on the Last Day: \u201cAmen. Come, Lord Jesus\u201d (Revelation 22:20)."}
{"prompt": "Taking oaths", "completion": "How do we understand St. Matthew and St. James in their writings as they talk against swearing and oaths (\"swear not at all\")? On a surface level, it appears all swearing/oaths are not to be practiced by God's people. If I'm not mistaken, I believe the first 300 years of the church held to this as necessary to be obeyed for all Christians. Thanks.\r\n\r\n\n\n\nThere is no absolute prohibition in the Bible regarding taking oaths. In Matthew 5:33-37 and James 5:12, we find instructions not to swear\u2014using God as our witness to assure people we are telling the truth\u2014needlessly and thoughtlessly. When taking an oath is necessary, we can comply. Jesus\u2019 own example in Matthew 26:63-64 illustrates that.\nI am not sure which sources you might be referencing for your thoughts on the early Christian Church\u2019s views toward taking oaths. In general, most Christians have held to the view stated above."}
{"prompt": "Heavenly feasting", "completion": "There are many references to a feast in heaven.

What that might consist of, we will have to wait and see. (But it will be worth the wait!)\nWe do know that there will not be problems like hunger or thirst in heaven (Revelation 7:16). Those are problems caused by sin. Life with God in heaven will be an eternal existence in which Christians are free from sin and all its consequences."}

If the usage involves superstitious practices like you mentioned, then it is certainly appropriate for you to speak to her. As Christians, we look to God for our safety and strength (Psalm 46:1)."}
{"prompt": "Model constitution", "completion": "My question concerns women serving in the church. The WELS model constitution cites Acts 6:1-6 as the scriptural support for choosing church officers and board/committee members. Verse 6:3 reads \"Brothers and sisters, choose seven men from among you who are known to be full of the Spirit and wisdom.\" Is Paul endorsing the women's participation in a role of leadership by helping choose the deacons? If so, why doesn't that apply to women's roles in the church of today? Also, they are to choose men. Does being a man fall under the phrase \"with like qualifications?\"\r\nI doubt the people who wrote the model constitution ever envisioned the issue of women serving would be the issue it has become, which leads me to my next question. It is perhaps best suited for the Synod parliamentarian. I believe the authors' intent in the sections concerning councils and boards etc. was to limit the positions to men. How does Synod interpret the model constitution concerning this matter?\r\nI realize the COP is working on new model constitutions addressing women's proper role concerning service in the church. I look forward to reading the Bible study they are putting together for approval at next summer's Synod convention. However, I would appreciate clarification concerning the document currently in use. Thanks!\r\n\n\n\nThe current WELS Model Constitution simply references Acts 6:1-6 without including the text. The verse you cited and quoted does illustrate how some Bible translations like the New International Version moved from a translation of \u201cbrothers\u201d (1984 edition) to \u201cbrothers and sisters\u201d (2011 edition).\nThe significance of Acts 6:3-5 is that the apostles delegated the selection of the seven men to the congregation in Jerusalem. As with any congregational matter, the church would have addressed this situation with the roles of men and women in mind.\nFor an answer to how the Synod interprets \u201cthe model constitution regarding this matter,\u201d I would refer you to the \u201cIn the Church\u201d section of the \u201cMan and Woman Roles\u201d doctrinal statement. This link will take you to that statement.\nFinally, do be aware that the Conference of Presidents is not \u201cworking on new model constitutions addressing women\u2019s proper role concerning service in the church.\u201d What the Conference of Presidents is working on is an updated statement and accompanying Bible study on the roles of men and women. The October 15, 2019 Together newsletter provided information on those materials."}
{"prompt": "Soldiers and video games", "completion": "Why is it that Christians are so quick to condemn playing video games that contain violence like Call of Duty, yet are so honoring and supportive of Christians serving in the military?  I understand that the Augsburg Confession states that Christians can be soldiers, and I agree with this.  I just don't get why if serving as a solider is not sinful and an honorable thing, why would it be a sin to play a video game like Call of Duty where you pretend to be a solider?\n\n\nGod\u2019s fifth commandment has the purpose of protecting life and prohibiting murder. God has that concern for a person\u2019s life because when earthly life comes to an end, so does that person\u2019s time of grace (Isaiah 55:6; Hebrews 9:27).\nIn the Bible, God explains that only he (Deuteronomy 32:39) or his representatives (Romans 13:4) have the right to end a person\u2019s life. If soldiers, in defense of their country and in service to God\u2019s representatives in government (Romans 13:1-4) take the life of another person, that is not a sinful act.\nIn the case of some video games, virtual killing is presented as entertainment. Each Christian will have to determine the appropriateness of being involved in those games. What games like those can certainly do is desensitize people to violent loss of human life and to devalue human life.\nRecognizing that the images and sounds that reach our minds can affect us, it is no surprise that the Bible gives this instruction: \u201cFinally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable\u2014if anything is excellent or praiseworthy\u2014think about such things\u201d (Philippians 4:8). It would be helpful for Christians of all ages to ask themselves if the entertainment they are engaged in passes the \u201cPhilippians test.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "AALC and WELS", "completion": "Hello. I was born, raised, and confirmed in an AALC church. After moving, I have been attending my local WELS church. I genuinely enjoy the services, however, I fail to see any differences in beliefs between my old church and this church. What are the core differences? Additionally, I have struggled understanding the view of the WELS church on Communion. As somebody who views the Bible as truth, and knows that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and their Lord and Savior, it pains me to watch those who share the same beliefs with me receive Communion, while I cannot. Can you guide me to where the Bible teaches that anyone should attempt to dictate who comes to the Lord's table?\n\n\nThe history of the American Association of Lutheran Churches (AALC) began when twelve congregations of the American Lutheran Church (ALC) did not participate in the formation of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA). Those congregations formed the American Association of Lutheran Churches in 1988. In 2007, the AALC entered into altar and pulpit fellowship with the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod (LCMS).\nWELS and the former ALC did not agree in areas like biblical interpretation, church fellowship, and church and ministry\u2014just to name a few. Those same items are barriers to fellowship between WELS and the AALC. In addition, since the AALC is in fellowship with LCMS (and WELS is not), WELS cannot be in fellowship with the AALC.\nBecause the celebration of the Lord\u2019s Supper is an expression of oneness in faith (1 Corinthians 10:17), our pastors seek to present a genuine picture of unity in faith through the biblical practice of closed communion. That practice also has the purpose of ensuring, as far as humanly possible, that those receiving the sacrament will do so to their benefit and not their harm (1 Corinthians 11:27-32).\nI encourage you to speak to the pastor of the WELS church you are attending. He can explain the means through which church membership can be established, making available the reception of the Lord\u2019s Supper. God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Athanasian Creed", "completion": "I have a few questions.  It appears we do not affirm the Chalcedonian Creed.  Is this because of the Mother of God part?  Do we affirm Theotokos?  I am sure we would in light of Mary being the Mother of Jesus incarnate and only blessed by God but in no other way special in terms of sinful human nature.  Finally, in the Athanasian Creed I love it all except this part: \"And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting.\"  We are so strong in our confessions in justification through Christ alone, so how can we say that?  I understand it says in Matthew, \"Those who have done good will rise to live, but those who have practiced evil will rise to be condemned.\" (EHV) But that is only because of faith in Christ.  \n\n\nWe recognize that the Council of Chalcedon (481 A.D.) formulated helpful statements on the person of Jesus Christ. We accept the term Theotokos (\u201cthe one who bore God\u201d), since the child born to Mary was Jesus, the Son of God (Matthew 1:23; Luke 1:31-35; 2:11).\nThe phrase from the Athanasian Creed you cited reflects the language of Scripture regarding God\u2019s judgment of humanity (Matthew 16:27; John 5:28-29; Romans 2:6-10; 2 Corinthians 5:10).\nGod certainly judges what is in the heart. It is faith in Jesus Christ alone that saves, and it is unbelief that condemns (Mark 16:16). Salvation is entirely God\u2019s doing; we do not contribute to our salvation in any way (Romans 3:28; Galatians 3:11; Ephesians 2:8-9).\nScripture explains that saving faith and condemning unbelief manifest themselves in people\u2019s lives. And so on the last day, the Lord will point out the good works that Christians have done and the sins that unbelievers have committed (Matthew 25:31-46). Those good works of Christians were not the payment for their salvation; the good works were the evidence of Spirit-worked saving faith in Jesus who paid the penalty for their sins. The sins of unbelievers will be singled out because they rejected the only means of forgiveness for their sins.\nWe could think of the sentence in the Athanasian Creed (\u201cThose who have done good will enter eternal life, but those who have done evil will go into eternal fire.\u201d) this way: \u201cThose who believed in Jesus as their Savior\u2014and saving faith always produces visible fruit\u2014will enter eternal life, but those who rejected Jesus\u2014such people cannot perform good works, nor do they enjoy forgiveness of sins\u2014will go into eternal fire.\u201d Your question illustrates the helpfulness of providing explanatory comments when using the Athanasian Creed in our worship services."}

{"prompt": "Help with granddaughter's situation", "completion": "I am a follower of Jesus Christ and am at odds as to what I should do. My granddaughter is living with a guy and they need things for the apartment. I have been asked if I would help her. I Know this is a sin and so does she. We were all raised in and believe the word of God. My question is how to show the love of Christ. I don't want her to think I am here to judge her. We all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. Praying you are able to answer my question.   \n\n\nWhat can be helpful in your situation is that you and your granddaughter are in agreement on how you both view her situation. Your dilemma is trying to determine how to give your granddaughter consistent messages of God\u2019s love for her, your love for her and God\u2019s will for holy living (1 Thessalonians 4:7).\nOne course of action would be for you to explain to your granddaughter that you, in good conscience, cannot assist her in her situation. This would be applicable if you believed you would be guilty of sinning against your conscience (Romans 14:23) by assisting her financially. You could affirm your love for your granddaughter but explain the reasons for not assisting her. One of the challenges with this course of action is trying to keep the lines of communication open with your granddaughter in the future.\nAnother course of action might be to provide assistance of some kind that does not go towards the maintenance of her shared apartment. Could there be a way that you express to your granddaughter your thoughts on the living arrangement and also provide assistance of some kind only for her? The limited information I have prevents me from going any further with this possibility.\nYou can certainly point your granddaughter to Jesus\u2019 words of \u201cseeking first [God\u2019s] kingdom and his righteousness\u201d (Matthew 6:33) and the Lord\u2019s promise of taking care of the needs of people who do put him first in life. Sometimes people get involved in live-in situations for financial reasons and budgetary concerns. With Matthew 6:33 in mind, I like to remind people that God has his own math system for taking care of his people\u2019s needs.\nFinally, if your granddaughter is a member of a church, her pastor needs to become involved in the situation. This can alleviate some stress in your life.\nGod bless you with wisdom, love and strength!"}

Any worldly gain is meaningless if it means spending eternity with him in hell. \u201cResist the devil\u201d (James 4:7) is the Bible\u2019s instruction on our interaction with Satan.\nIf you are seeking something for life, go to God in prayer. He answers prayer with our best interests in mind. Recognize that Satan seeks only to devour and kill (1 Peter 5:8). Resist him with the armor God provides (Ephesians 6:10-17)."}
{"prompt": "The book of Revelation", "completion": "How come WELS pastors don't teach about the book of Revelation?

{"prompt": "Brothers and sisters", "completion": "Thanks for this site!\r\nWho are \"our brothers and sisters in Christ?\"  I have heard the term used to describe all, and only, the members of our WELS' churches and those with whom we are in doctrinal fellowship.  Would we also use the same term to refer to the Christians in false visible churches?\r\nThanks!\n\n\nThis We Believe, a statement of belief of our church body, makes this profession:\n\u201c1. We believe that there is one holy Christian church, which is the temple of God (1 Corinthians 3:16) and the body of Christ (Ephesians 1:23; 4:12). The members of this one church are all those who are the \u2018sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus\u2019 (Galatians 3:26). The church, then, consists only of believers, or saints, whom God accepts as holy for the sake of Jesus\u2019 righteousness, which has been credited to them (2 Corinthians 5:21). These saints are scattered throughout the world. All people who believe that Jesus is their Savior from sin are members of the holy Christian church, regardless of the nation, race, or church body to which they belong.\n\u201c2. We believe that this holy Christian church is a reality, although it is not an external, visible organization. Because \u2018man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart\u2019 (1 Samuel 16:7), only the Lord knows \u2018those who are his\u2019 (2 Timothy 2:19). The members of the holy Christian church are known only to God; we cannot distinguish between true believers and hypocrites. The holy Christian church is therefore invisible and cannot be identified with any one church body or with the total membership of all church bodies.\n\u201c3. We believe that the presence of the holy Christian church nevertheless can be recognized. Wherever the gospel is preached and the sacraments are administered, the holy Christian church is present, for through the means of grace true faith is produced and preserved (Isaiah 55:10,11). The means of grace, therefore, are called the marks of the church.\u201d\nThe preceding paragraphs explain that we can have brothers and sisters in the faith \u201cwherever the gospel is preached and the sacraments are administered.\u201d When the Holy Spirit works through the gospel and leads people to confess that Jesus Christ is their Savior from sin, those people are our brothers and sisters in the faith.\nBut you recognize from the preceding paragraphs that we are speaking about the invisible church: the holy Christian church, the communion of saints. God alone knows who belongs to that church; God alone can see what is in a person\u2019s heart.\nYou and I operate in the world of visible churches\u2014where we can see who the members are and what confession of faith they uphold by their membership. That is why when it comes to visible churches, the use of \u201cbrothers and sisters\u201d is especially appropriate when we think of those with whom we are in church fellowship. So, we speak of \u201csister\u201d churches and \u201csister\u201d church bodies."}
{"prompt": "Men and women in society", "completion": "I searched under \"roles of men and women in society\" and found nothing, so my question is as follows:\r\nWELS\u2019 position on the doctrine of the role of women, as found on this link (https://wels.net/about-wels/what-we-believe/doctrinal-statements/man-and-woman-roles/) says,\r\n\u201c6. We reject the opinion that male headship and female submission apply only to marriage or only to marriage and the church (1 Co 11:3; 1 Ti 2:12).\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to the statement above, women are subject to the headship of men in marriage, in the church, and in society.  Does that mean a woman cannot hold a secular job (department headship in a college/university, civic headship over government employees, CEO/VP in industry/agriculture/science, president/congressperson/judge/governor/mayor/etc., for example) in which she has men in positions below her?  Can WELS members vote for female political leaders?  Should a WELS man take a secular job under the authority of a woman?\r\n\r\n\n\n\nThe same document that you referenced also states this in the \u201cIn the World\u201d section:\n\u201c20. Christians also accept the biblical role relationship principle for their life and work in the world (1 Co 11:3; Eph 5:6-17). Christians seek to do God\u2019s will consistently in every area of their lives. We will therefore strive to apply this role relationship principle to our life and work in the world.\n\u201c21. Scripture leaves a great deal to our conscientious Christian judgment as we live the role relationship principle in the world. In Christian love we will refrain from unduly binding the consciences of the brothers and sisters in our fellowship. Rather, we will encourage each other as we seek to apply this principle to our lives in the world.\n\u201c22. Because the unregenerate world is not motivated by the Gospel or guided by God\u2019s will (1 Co 2:14), we as Christians will not try to force God\u2019s will upon the world (1 Co 5:12). We will seek to influence and change the world by our Gospel witness in word and deed (Mk 16:15; Mt 5:16).\n\u201cConscientious Christian judgment\u201d will go a long way in answering your three questions.\nIn \u201cMan and Woman in God\u2019s World,\u201d our church body states this: \u201cThe headship principle is equally valid in society, since this principle is part of God\u2019s unchanging will for men and women in their relationships with one another. The Bible, however, does not make direct application of the headship principle in society as it does in marriage and the church. For that reason we need to avoid making applications that may lead us to say more than Scripture says. There is no scriptural mandate or model, for example, asserting that a Christian woman may never hold a position of leadership in secular society. Nor do Christian men have biblical warrant to assume that they dare never be placed in a position where a women will have authority over them in business or politics.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Predestination", "completion": "For those who are not predestined, what is their goal or purpose on earth? And what hope do they have to look forward to if they were not chosen to be saved? What if I was not elect?  What am I supposed to do?\n\n\nGod wants all people to come to repentance and faith in Jesus Christ his Son (1 Timothy 2:4; 2 Peter 3:9). God gives people a time of grace to confess their sins and confess faith in Jesus Christ. If people are led to those lifelong confessions, it is only because of the work of the Holy Spirit in their hearts. Their faith was not their choosing (John 15:16). Their faith was the result of God electing them to faith (Acts 13:48; Ephesians 1:4-6; Romans 8:29-30). If people reject Jesus as their Savior, they are to blame (Ezekiel 33:11; Matthew 23:37; John 3:18-20).\nThe doctrine of election is intended to be a comfort to Christians, assuring them that their salvation is entirely God\u2019s doing\u2014from beginning to end. Their saving faith is a gift of God (Ephesians 2:8), and their faith exists because God elected them in eternity (2 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Timothy 1:9).\nIf, according to your question, an unbeliever wonders about election, I would encourage that person not to try to peer into eternity to understand the present but to focus on the present: \u201cI tell you, now is the time of God\u2019s favor, now is the day of salvation\u201d (2 Corinthians 6:2). I would encourage that person to make use of his or her time of grace in the best way possible: by reading and studying God\u2019s word. It is through the word that the Holy Spirit works saving faith in hearts (Romans 10:17).\nNorthwestern Publishing House offers a book you would find valuable. It is \u201cPredestination.\u201d I commend it for your reading."}

Or would I need to find someone else to do the ceremony? \n\n\nIt is likely that your pastor could conduct the wedding service at a venue other than your church. You will want to contact your pastor and explain the venue you have in mind. He can then respond to your plans. God\u2019s blessings on your wedding!"}
{"prompt": "Worship attire", "completion": "My friend wants to come to check out our church as she is thinking of switching synods, but she wants to know what is appropriate attire for a service. \n\n\nAs you are a member of that congregation, you are really in a better position than I to explain the culture of your congregation. You can explain to your friend how you normally dress for a worship service.\nYou can explain to your friend that our churches do not have dress codes. The area and culture of some congregations lead to more formal attire on the part of worshipers, while more casual attire is found elsewhere. The age differences of worshipers in the same congregation also leads to a variety of attire.\nDo make it clear to your friend that the attitude of the heart (1 Samuel 16:7) is much more important than how we dress for church.\nPerhaps you can sit with your friend and guide her through the worship service. That would make for a comfortable first-time worship experience in a new church."}

Which is correct?\n\n\nThe terms are used interchangeably. The difference depends on the intended emphasis.\nOur new Catechism offers this explanation: \u201cWe express this truth [that stated in 1 Corinthians 10:17] by practicing close or closed Communion. We might refer to it as \u2018close\u2019 Communion because we only commune with those who are united with us in faith. We may also say that we practice \u2018closed\u2019 Communion to indicate that the Lord\u2019s Supper is closed to those who believe and teach differently. Whichever term is used, the practice of communing only with those who share a common faith is according to God\u2019s command and testifies to our desire to be faithful to God\u2019s Word.\u201d (Page 368)"}
{"prompt": "Medical treatment", "completion": "If a person refuses life-saving medical treatment, would it be considered suicide?\n\n\nYou will want to speak to your pastor if your question involves you and your health.\nAnother valuable resource for you is Christian Life Resources. There you will find information like this: \u201cQUESTION: What medical treatment may I in good conscience refuse?\n\u201cANSWER: We should never refuse any medical treatment for the purpose of hastening our death. The time of death is God\u2019s to choose. Under most circumstances we should not refuse treatment for conditions easily and commonly treated like pneumonia, which if left untreated may kill us, for the purpose of hastening our death from a terminal condition like some forms of cancer. We also should not refuse food and water even when given artificially if the purpose is to hasten our death by malnutrition or dehydration so that we do not have to die naturally of some other condition over a period of months or even years.\n\u201cMajor surgery or other costly medical treatment of our modern age whose only purpose is to extend what God will take away very soon may in good conscience be refused. Limited resources may not make these treatments possible, and the knowledge that our times are in God\u2019s hands does not make them necessary.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Near death experiences", "completion": "I'm pretty sure I've read Bible verses that say loved ones in heaven can't come back and visit and they don't know what's going on down on earth. I have a friend who says they had a near death experience and their loved one talked to them and now is visiting her at night. Did her loved one really talk to her and is her loved one visiting her at night?\n\n\nIt can be challenging to assess and evaluate near death experiences. Some causes might be psychological, emotional or medical (drug related). What is helpful in evaluating these experiences is recognizing whether or not they conflict with clear scriptural truths.\nThe Bible does tell us that when death takes place, the body and soul separate, and there is immediate judgment as the soul goes to heaven or hell (Ecclesiastes 12:7; Luke 16:19-31; Hebrews 9:27). We also know from the Bible that God controls the places where souls go at death (Luke 16:26). So, no, a deceased loved one would not be visiting your friend."}

Thank you! \n\n\n\u201cLikewise, teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but to teach what is good. Then they can urge the younger women to love their husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home, to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word of God\u201d (Titus 2:3-5).\nThose verses of Scripture remain applicable to Christian women. Those words instruct mature Christian women to model the Christian faith to younger Christian women.\nOlder Christian women are in a position to show younger Christian women how to live as followers of the Lord Jesus Christ. That includes not slandering other people and not being controlled by alcohol (verse three).\nMature Christian women can teach younger Christian women how to carry out their roles as wives and mothers faithfully (verse four).\nOlder Christian women can give younger Christian women lessons in controlling the sinful nature and executing faithfully their responsibilities in the home (verse five).\nBy the identification you gave yourself, you do have a responsibility to teach these lessons of Christian living to younger Christian women. Do keep in mind that many of these lessons are caught and not taught. That means that you are teaching these lessons to younger Christian women by your actions and attitude\u2014and not just your words.\nSo, keep teaching!

The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die\u201d (John 11:25-26).\nThe Bible does not specifically address a question like yours. Some people note that Peter knew who Moses and Elijah were at Jesus\u2019 transfiguration, even though he had never met them before in person (Matthew 17:4; Mark 9:5; Luke 9:33). They take that to mean that we too will know who other Christians in heaven are and how we might, or might not, have interacted with them during our earthly lives. Others point to 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 where Paul comforted the Christians in Thessalonica with the assurance that they would see Christians who had died in the past and be with them together forever.\nWhat is crystal clear from Scripture is that when Jesus returns visibly to this world on the Last Day, Christians \u201cwill be with the Lord forever\u201d (1 Thessalonians 4:17)."}
{"prompt": "Grades and knowledge", "completion": "Lately I have been struggling in school to get good grades. I have studied and put so many hours into preparing for my tests, but the outcomes of my tests do not seem to match up with my work done. Because of this, is God somehow telling me something about why I am not doing very well? I am praying constantly and getting very confused on why these bad grades could help me later in my life.\n\n\nI would encourage you not to try to connect your test grades to a message from God. What I do not know is what help you might be seeking to improve your test scores. Does your school have a learning center or a tutoring service that you could utilize? Have you talked to your teacher(s) about different test-taking strategies or study skills? If not, do pursue those options.\nI would also encourage you to put test scores and grades in perspective. While grades can be important for eligibility in extracurricular activities and financial assistance in higher education, do keep in mind that learning is much more important. The knowledge that you acquire, regardless of your grades, is important now and in the future.\nFinally, you and I will want to remember that natural talents and spiritual gifts are going to vary from one Christian to another. The description of the Christian Church as the body of Christ emphasizes the diversity and importance of each member (Romans 12:4-8; 1 Corinthians 12:12-31). You and I can easily become discouraged if we look around and see someone else who might have greater talents or gifts than we do. That \u201ccomparison game\u201d diminishes God\u2019s personalized treatment of us: we are a unique part of the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:27), and God has gifted us according to his wisdom and love (1 Peter 4:10).\nSo, be faithful and keep working to the best of your God-given abilities. Remember that the Bible contains the most important knowledge we have. That is why it says, \u201cBut grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ\u201d (2 Peter 3:18)."}
{"prompt": "Frequency of receiving the Lord's Supper", "completion": "How many times can I take Communion in a week?\n\n\nThere is no set number. The Bible speaks of \u201coften\u201d regarding our reception of the Lord\u2019s Supper. \u201cFor whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord\u2019s death until he comes\u201d (1 Corinthians 11:26). \u201cWhenever\u201d has the idea of \u201cas often as\u201d in the original Greek.\nOn a practical basis, your reception of the Sacrament will be limited by the number of times your congregation offers the Lord\u2019s Supper during its worship services.\nOne of the questions in the new Catechism is this: \u201cWhy will we want to receive Communion often?\u201d The answers are: \u201cWe struggle every day against our sinful flesh and need God\u2019s assistance to overcome our weakness in faith. God gives us the forgiveness of sins in the Lord\u2019s Supper, providing us with freedom from guilt and strengthening our faith. Receiving God\u2019s forgiving love in the Sacrament empowers us to live godly lives of thanksgiving. When we receive the Lord\u2019s Supper and publicly proclaim the Lord\u2019s death together with others, we are encouraging one another in our Christian faith.\u201d\nSo, be a guest at the Lord\u2019s Supper \u201coften.\u201d\u00a0 And use God\u2019s word regularly as well."}
{"prompt": "Pastoral contact", "completion": "My wife committed adultery.  She left our church.  How often should my pastor reach out trying to get her back to God and come back to our marriage?  \n\n\nI am sorry to hear about your wife\u2019s actions and how your life has been affected.\nIf leaving the church means that your wife is no longer a member of your congregation, that means that your wife has removed herself from the discipline of your church and the authority of your pastor (Matthew 18:15-20).\nYour pastor can certainly speak to your wife as he has opportunity but, because the pastor-member relationship no longer exists, his influence on her life has greatly diminished. It is much easier now for your wife to decline an invitation to speak with your pastor.\nYour situation calls for Christian counseling. I hope you are in contact with your pastor. Do pass your concerns along to him. You can certainly ask your pastor to try to speak to your wife. Those who know of your situation can definitely pray for you and your wife. God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Cornelius", "completion": "In Acts10, Cornelius\u2019 prayers were acknowledged by God. However, he was not yet saved. Can you explain this? Thanks. \n\n\nTo understand the situation, we need to keep in mind how early in the history of the Christian Church the event in Acts 10 took place. Cornelius was a Gentile whose beliefs were Jewish. Through his faith in the Savior whom God promised, he was a child of God. That is why God heard and answered his prayers.\nLike other Jewish believers before him, Cornelius was looking for the promised Savior. Peter told Cornelius that the waiting was over because God had fulfilled his promises of a Savior in Jesus of Nazareth. Now the focus of Cornelius\u2019 faith shifted from the Savior who was promised to the Savior who had come. With that in mind, Cornelius and his family were baptized."}
{"prompt": "Concern for granddaughter", "completion": "We have a granddaughter who will be performing in the musical \"Head Over Heels.\" We did not know anything about this production so I found things about it on Facebook. I was upset at what I read. It is full of transgender, lesbian, etc. issues being presented as being very acceptable. It seems to be a very inappropriate production for anyone to see much less young teens (she is a 9th grader). I don't know how to react to my granddaughter/or my son. They live in a different state and therefore we see them only once/year. We do have phone conversations on a regular basis though with our son. Recently it has become evident that the family is not placing Christian values as important in their lives. I am afraid that her being involved in this activity will just take her farther from the values our son/her dad was taught. How do we respond/react? \n\n\nFor starters, considering the age of your granddaughter, one has to wonder if there is any revision of the content of the musical. This could be something you talk to your granddaughter about. You could explain your familiarity with the musical and ask whether or not some of the objectionable themes are in the production with which she is involved.\nIf objectionable and inappropriate themes are present in her production, you can ask your granddaughter what she knows and thinks about her role in the musical. You can ask her what she knows and thinks about the themes of the musical that concern you. You can ask her how all of this lines up with the faith she has been taught.\nI do not pretend that these conversations will be easy, but the difficult conversations are the ones we need to make. A similar, difficult conversation can take place with your son.\nBeyond these suggestions, regular contacts\u2014including emails and texts\u2014with your granddaughter that encourage her in the Christian faith and Christian life are important. You can supply what Christian encouragement she might not be receiving from her parents.\nFinally, but very importantly, continue to pray for your granddaughter and her family. Scripture assures us that prayer is \u201cpowerful and effective\u201d (James 5:16). Pray that your granddaughter and her family remain strong in the faith and let the light of their faith shine brightly (Matthew 5:16)."}
{"prompt": "Baptism of friend's baby", "completion": "My wife (a WELS member) and myself have been attending her WELS church since we were married 5 years ago. I have enjoyed the messages put forth during the services and have begun the process of joining the church. One particular message that resonates with me is the importance of infant baptism. I have a Christian friend who is in a same-sex marriage who has just adopted a baby from Africa. They also see the importance of infant baptism and are currently looking for a church in our neighborhood that will meet this need. I told them about how much I enjoy going to my wife's church and that they should consider having their baby baptized there. My wife says that a WELS church would never baptize a baby from a same-sex couple. If this is true, why would a church refuse the opportunity to put a baby on the path to God's kingdom? I pose this question on this forum to avoid any embarrassment I meant cause my wife by asking one of our church pastors directly. Thank you very much for your response.\n\n\nYou would not be causing any embarrassment if you were to ask the pastors of your wife\u2019s congregation this question. I encourage you to do that.\nBringing a child to be baptized requires little effort on the part of parents. What requires much more time and energy and zeal is bringing up that child \u201cin the training and instruction of the Lord\u201d (Ephesians 6:4). Parents in a same-sex marriage, living contrary to God\u2019s will (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4-6; Romans 1:26-27; 1 Corinthians 6:9-10), would not be bringing up a child \u201cin the training and instruction of the Lord.\u201d While Baptism can plant the seed of faith in a child\u2019s heart, that seed needs to be nurtured through faithful use of God\u2019s word. Faith that was once planted in a heart through Baptism can weaken and die."}
{"prompt": "Jesus and heaven", "completion": "What does it mean when Jesus says no one has been to heaven?\n\n\nIn Jesus\u2019 conversation with Nicodemus, the Lord said, \u201cNo one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven\u2014the Son of Man\u201d (John 3:13).\nIn the immediate context of that statement, Jesus explained his uniqueness to Nicodemus. Only Jesus came from heaven to earth to explain spiritual matters to people. No human being has gone from earth to heaven to acquire that information and then returned to earth to share it.\nJesus is not saying that Christians do not enter heaven when their lives on earth come to an end. He is speaking about the source of divine revelation. That source is heaven, and Jesus came from heaven to tell people what they need to know and believe."}
{"prompt": "Bible for Christmas present", "completion": "My husband would like a personalized Bible for Christmas.  With so many out there, what should I look for when looking online for a Bible? Version and other info.\n\n\nWhat a wonderful request on the part of your husband! You are correct in noting that there are many, many Bible translations available today.\nPerhaps I can narrow down the options if I let you know that our new Catechism is available with Scripture verses from three different Bible translations: The New International Version (NIV), the English Standard Version (ESV) and the Evangelical Heritage Version (EHV).\nAny of those translations would benefit your husband. What might be helpful is selecting the translation that your congregation uses. Perhaps your pastor can help you arrive at a final decision."}
{"prompt": "The Holy Spirit and thoughts", "completion": "Recently, I've heard people say the Holy Spirit put words in their mind. Usually, the words they are referring to are a Bible verse. How can a person know if the words are from the Holy Spirit or something that their human mind generated? Additionally, some people claim that God \"lays\" something on their heart. How can a person decipher these thoughts and feelings as being from God or generated in the human mind?\n\n\nConsidering what the Bible teaches about the work of the Holy Spirit, we may not have to wrestle too much over your first question. The Bible teaches that God\u2019s word is \u201calive and active\u201d (Hebrews 4:12). The Holy Spirit works through the gospel\u2014the word alone or the word connected to water in Baptism\u2014to fill hearts with saving faith. Then, the Holy Spirit dwells within Christians (Romans 8:9-11; 1 Corinthians 3:16). As Christians, our new self delights in God\u2019s word (Psalm 1:2). When we use God\u2019s word and impress its truths on our hearts (Deuteronomy 6:6-9), it is no surprise that the Holy Spirit is at work in our hearts and minds (Romans 8:16). That work can certainly include leading us to recall Bible verses and biblical truths.\nWith your second question, you would want to ask people what they mean by God \u201claying something on their heart.\u201d It could be a matter of seeing an opportunity to help someone and then thinking of Galatians 6:10 \u2013 \u201cTherefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.\u201d Or it could be a conscience that awakens (Romans 2:15). Again, you would want to ask people to explain what they mean by that expression."}
{"prompt": "Defending family members", "completion": "If a Christian father stands by idly as his child is being kidnapped, is he guilty of sin?  I heard an Amish person say that if someone is in danger like this, they should not do anything because they believe in non-resistance.  I was reading the Large Catechism and it seems to suggest that those who fail to defend their neighbors are guilty of sin.  I am going to be a Christian father soon and have seen these types of things in the news, and want to know if it is right for a Christian father to defend his child or if he should stand by idly.  Thank you.\n\n\nPerhaps the section of the Large Catechism you have in mind is this: \u201cSecondly, under this commandment not only he is guilty who does evil to his neighbor, but he also who can do him good, prevent, resist evil, defend and save him, so that no bodily harm or hurt happen to him, and yet does not do it. If, therefore, you send away one that is naked when you could clothe him, you have caused him to freeze to death; if you see one suffer hunger and do not give him food, you have caused him to starve. So also, if you see any one innocently sentenced to death or in like distress, and do not save him, although you know ways and means to do so, you have killed him. And it will not avail you to make the pretext that you did not afford any help, counsel, or aid thereto, for you have withheld your love from him and deprived him of the benefit whereby his life would have been saved.\u201d [Concordia Triglotta, 635]\nA recently-published answer included this response: \u201cSome Christians look to Matthew 5:39 and Romans 12:17 as absolute directives not to resist physical threats. In their context though the verses advocate love toward others instead of seeking revenge.\n\u201cOthers look to sections of Scripture like Proverbs 24:11-12 and Luke 22:35-38 as the basis for defending oneself and one\u2019s family from physical threats. John 18:10-11 describes Peter\u2019s wrongful use of a weapon as he tried to interfere with the Lord\u2019s humble submission to his Father\u2019s will.\n\u201cThe positive emphasis of the Fifth Commandment \u2018to help and befriend [our neighbor] in every bodily need\u2019 can find application in defending oneself and one\u2019s family."}
{"prompt": "Premonitions", "completion": "Hello: I am currently a few weeks from completing my Master's degree in counseling. Today in class we had an interesting discussion I would like to hear the Christian view on. The discussion was on the presentation of mental disorders and if certain things could be classified as a symptom. In one case, the patient reported having a premonition a loved one would die the day before they did. While it could be considered a symptom of this patient's disorder, it started a discussion if premonitions could actually be a symptom since most people at one time or another have experienced them. The experiences discussed ranged from meeting a significant other and knowing they'd marry that person, feelings to take a different route only to learn later of an accident that occurred around the time they would have been there, feeling like a loved one was going to die before they did, thinking of someone only to hear from them, etc. The discussion proceeded to speculation where they come from - God, deceased loved ones, angels, Spirit guides, etc. I don't recall Scripture talking about premonitions. What is the Christian view on premonitions and where they might come from?\n\n\nIn the Bible, God certainly did speak directly to individuals about future events (Exodus 7:1-5) or through others (2 Kings 20:1; Acts 21:10-11).\nWhile God can do anything, we do not have any promise from him\u2014or expect him\u2014to speak to us outside the Bible (Hebrews 1:1-2).\nFor a good treatment on the topic of information and the future, I would refer you to the first chapter of the book \u201cWizards that Peep.\u201d It is available from Northwestern Publishing House."}
{"prompt": "Suffering and God", "completion": "I'm dying from a terminal illness. I'm frustrated because I believed Jesus would help me. The longer I suffer, the more I doubt. If there is life in heaven after death, why does the Bible say no one praises God from the grave?. A living dog is better than a dead lion? No one has ever been to heaven except the one who came from heaven? Jesus said this. I have lost everything in this life. The more I pray for faith and a relationship with God, the worse I get. Is anything God tells us in his word true? What makes Israel's God different from another society's god? Why do good God-fearing people suffer with no help? Am I not loved by the God I put all of my hope in?\n\n\nDear friend, your questions tell me that you need someone to talk to and someone to serve you with God\u2019s word. I trust you have a pastor with whom you are in contact. He will be able to address your questions in more detail than I can.\nHere is how I can respond from a distance. Physical death is one of the consequences of sin (Romans 6:23). We will all experience death (Hebrews 9:27) unless the Lord returns visibly to this world in our lifetime.\nWhen it comes to illnesses, the Lord can heal and extend life from our perspective or, in his love and wisdom, he can allow death to take place. In either case, God is working for our good (Romans 8:28). In the latter case, God is bringing about the greatest good possible because he is calling one of his children home.\nPsalm 6:5 does state: \u201cAmong the dead no one proclaims your name. Who praises you from the grave?\u201d That verse is simply pointing out the contrast between those who are alive on the earth and those who are not. A section of the Bible like Revelation 7:9-17 describes Christians who had died praising God in his presence in heaven.\nThe verse you cited about a dog and a lion (Ecclesiastes 9:4) simply speaks of the connection of hope to life. Death ends all hope for those who are not connected to Jesus Christ in faith.\nJesus\u2019 words about heaven (John 3:13) mean that only he came from heaven to earth to explain spiritual matters to people. No human being has gone from earth to heaven to acquire that information and then returned to earth to share it.\nEverything that God tells you in his word is true (Numbers 23:19; John 17:17). He tells you that your sins have been forgiven (1 John 2:2). He tells you that whoever believes in Jesus has forgiveness of sins and eternal life (John 3:16). He tells you that those who believe in Jesus will live forever (John 11:25), and death cannot separate his children from his love (Romans 8:38-39).\nThe God of the Bible, the triune God, alone exists (Isaiah 45:5). All other gods are idols. You can trust God\u2014and his power and his wisdom and his love.\nAgain, I hope you have a pastor with whom you can share your questions and concerns. He will be glad to share the message of God\u2019s word with you. God bless you."}

Is it wrong for me to convert from non-denomination to WELS Lutheran?\n\n\nIt would be wrong only if you joined your friend\u2019s church simply because of your desire to have a relationship with her. Membership in a congregation and church body implies that a person\u2019s faith matches the confession of that church and church body.\nWELS congregations offer Bible Information Classes (or ones with similar titles) that explain biblical teachings. Upon completion of the classes, adult confirmation is available for those who profess that the instruction they have received is what the Bible teaches.\u00a0 Adult confirmation would then establish membership.\nI would encourage you to attend the classes offered by your friend\u2019s congregation.

{"prompt": "Long-suffering", "completion": "What does long-suffering mean?  My daughter has a chronic medical condition which is hard for me to accept and deal with. I wonder if this applies?\n\n\n\u201cLong-suffering\u201d is the King James Version counterpart of \u201cpatience\u201d that we find in more contemporary Bible translations. \u201cLong-suffering\u201d or \u201cpatience\u201d is a quality attributed to God (1 Peter 3:20) and his children, Christians (James 5:8, 10). By your patient attitude, the word applies to you and your situation.\nWhen we keep in mind that \u201cpatience\u201d is part of the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22), we recognize that God develops and increases that attribute in us through the use of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nMay God continue to give you and your daughter patience as a loving and wise God directs all in your lives for your spiritual and eternal welfare (Romans 8:28). God bless you and your daughter!"}
{"prompt": "Reasons for infant Baptism", "completion": "My girlfriend and I really want to move forward and possibly someday get married. She is Baptist and I am WELS Lutheran. Both of our beliefs are firm and we both don't want to agree with the other side. The deciding factor for us moving forward is whether to baptize our children as babies or to wait and do believer's baptism. What I have told her, and what I believe, is we should baptize babies because\r\n1. Baptism creates faith\r\n2. Receive forgiveness of sins - child would be in heaven if he/she dies\r\n3. Babies can believe and the Bible commands us to\r\nHer response is that it seems like Lutherans just try to find some shortcut that makes sure we see our babies in heaven, if they were to pass away, and that it is twisting of God's word to just have the outcome we wish for.\r\nWhat should I say, and what other points should I bring up? I know it was long. Thank you!\n\n\nAnother reason for baptizing infants and children is because they are part of Jesus\u2019 instruction to \u201cGo and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you\u201d (Matthew 28:19-20). The littlest and youngest of human beings are included in \u201call nations.\u201d\nAlso, we baptize infants and children because they are sinful by nature and have a need for spiritual rebirth (Psalm 51:5; John 3:5-6). Recognizing their natural spiritual condition and addressing it is not a \u201cshortcut\u201d of any kind.\nAnother topic of conversation you can have with your girlfriend concerns the source of Christian faith: who is responsible for it. Saving faith is God\u2019s gift to people (Ephesians 2:8), worked in their hearts through the word of God (Romans 10:17). People cannot bring themselves to saving faith in Christ or decide to invite him into their hearts because they are by nature spiritually dead (Ephesians 2:1), spiritually blind (Acts 26:17-18) and enemies of God (Romans 8:6-7). When we recognize that God works saving faith in people through his word, then we will recognize that God can work saving faith in infants and children through the application of water and his word.\nIt is good that you and your girlfriend are having these discussions. I trust you are fully aware of the challenges that can exist in a marriage in which a husband and wife do not agree on what the Bible teaches\u2014and the blessings that husband and wife enjoy when they share a common faith. Continue to share the truths of God\u2019s word with your girlfriend. God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Addressing astrology and horoscopes", "completion": "\"What's your sign?\" How can a Christian use this question to open a conversation that lovingly explains the dangers of astrology and horoscopes?\n\n\nWhat an interesting question!\nI can imagine a response that includes statements like these: \u201cMy sign is the cross of Christ.\u201d \u201cI trust the God who made the stars and holds the future in his hands.\u201d Bible passages that could accompany those statements are Galatians 6:14, Genesis 1:16, Psalm 8:3-4, Psalm 139:16 and Isaiah 46:10.\nWith a little more explanation from the Bible, you could let questioners know that you follow the \u201cstar of Jacob\u201d (Numbers 24:17). That prophecy pointed to Jesus Christ.\nYou have the right approach in that you want to \u201copen a conversation\u201d on the subject of astrology and horoscopes.

{"prompt": "Homosexuality", "completion": "What is WELS' stance on homosexuality?  Do they ordain homosexual pastors?\n\n\nElsewhere on this website you will find a \u201cStatement on homosexuality.\u201d The excerpts below illustrate our scriptural approach to the subject.\n\u201cScripture declares that homosexuality is a sin, which is contrary to God\u2019s intention in creating man and woman. Sinful resistance to the revealed will of God is a factor in this sin. People may become slaves to this sin (Romans 1:18-31, 1 Corinthians 6:9-10).\n\u201cMany factors contribute to individual acts of sin: the sinful nature we are born with, the weaknesses of our bodies, evil influences in our environment, temptations and encouragement from other sinners, and our own sinful choice join together to lead us into sin. All of these factors contribute to homosexual sin. The proportionate role of these various factors may vary from case to case.\n\u201cWe must warn the impenitent that homosexuality, like all sins, excludes people from eternal life (1 Corinthians 6:9-10). The church, therefore, must not, bless same-sex marriages or unions, since these are contrary to the will of God. The church must not place into nor retain in the public ministry of the Word people who defend, condone, or persist in words or actions that are contrary to God\u2019s law.\n\u201cWe are happy to assure the repentant who are struggling against this sin that they have complete forgiveness through the blood of Christ. When Christ died for all of the sins of the whole world, he gained forgiveness for homosexual deeds, for homosexual desires, and for the inborn sinful nature that produces these sins (1 Corinthians 6:11).\nThis link will enable you to read the entire document. As the document states, WELS does not ordain homosexual pastors."}
{"prompt": "Reasons for prayer", "completion": "This may seem like a really simple question, but why do we pray? And what are we supposed to pray for?\r\nI find prayer comforting because it reminds of all God's promises, but I can be reminded of God's truth without speaking to him. I also know that God tells us to cast all our cares on him and to thank and praise him, but is that really the only reason we pray? Because God tells us to?\r\nWhy is prayer so important and what power does it hold?\n\n\nWe pray because God invites and directs us to pray to him (Matthew 7:7; Luke 18:1; Ephesians 6:18; 1 Thessalonians 5:17). We pray because God promises that he will hear and answer our prayers (Psalm 50:15; 91:15; John 15:7). We pray because God tells us that prayer is \u201cpowerful and effective\u201d (James 5:16). James chapter five illustrates how God acted on Elijah\u2019s prayers. James 4:2 explains that God can manage his blessings in our lives to encourage us to pray to him.\nWhen it comes to the content of our prayers, 1 Timothy 2:1-2 provides guidance: \u201cI urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people\u2014for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness.\u201d\nAs God speaks to us through his word, so prayer provides God\u2019s children with the opportunity and privilege of speaking to God. Prayer rounds out the two-way conversation between God and people."}
{"prompt": "People and the gospel", "completion": "What happens to all the people who have lived in this world that never heard of Jesus? Are there any Scripture passages that shed light on this often asked question?\n\n\nYou are correct in that, over the years, countless people have asked questions like yours. Here is a response given to a previous question.\nGod reveals his existence by means of what we call the \u201cnatural knowledge of God.\u201d Through creation (Psalm 19:1-4) and conscience (Romans 2:14-15), God makes it known that he exists. While people cannot bring themselves to saving faith, God\u2019s purpose with this \u201cnatural knowledge\u201d is that people would \u201cseek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from any one of us\u201d (Acts 17:27).\nApart from the Bible, people know that there is a God, they know the basics of the Ten Commandments and they have a conscience that reacts to their thoughts and words and actions. It is only in the Bible though where people find the answer to the question: \u201cWhat must I do to be saved?\u201d (Acts 16:30) There is salvation only in Jesus Christ (Acts 4:12). What God reveals in the Bible is that faith in Jesus is essential for salvation (Mark 16:16). God also reveals that he brings people to saving faith in Jesus through his gospel in word and sacrament (Romans 10:14-17).\nSo, what about people who have not heard of Jesus? Through technological advances, the message of the Bible is reaching more and more parts of our world. Yet, there are people who have never heard of the gospel of Jesus Christ; some of those people may live closer to us than we think. What about their eternal fate if their lives on earth come to an end with an ignorance of the gospel?\nIs God to blame for their situation? Not at all. We need to put the blame where it belongs: on people and not on God. There were times when the entire human race knew the gospel. Back in the Garden of Eden and after the Flood in Noah\u2019s day, every person on the face of the earth knew the gospel. When we consider a question like yours, we have to ask: \u201cWhen and where did communication break down? Where did communication of the gospel break down? Who dropped the ball in teaching the gospel to the next generation?\u201d It does not take much for communication\u2014and gospel communication\u2014to break down, and the results are tragic.\nSo what we are left with is what God says in his word about the necessity of faith and the necessity to spread the gospel so the Holy Spirit can work through it and bring others to saving faith in Jesus. Your question is one that emphasizes how important it is to do what Jesus said two millennia ago: \u201cGo into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation\u201d (Mark 16:15)."}
{"prompt": "Fall into sin and the image of God", "completion": "I learned in Catechism class and I\u2019ve seen in a lot of WELS literature I\u2019ve read that true biblical doctrine is saying that we lost the image of God at the fall into sin. This is contrary to most other Christian denominations, who say we still bear the image of God (but they define the image of God differently as well, to include our logic and reason, our consciences, and the intrinsic value of our lives and our rights as citizens). We don\u2019t define it that way and we say the image of God, the righteousness and holiness and the perfect relationship with God, was lost at the fall. Why then, in Genesis 9:6, when God is commanding Noah\u2019s rules for the post-Flood world, does he give his reason for murder being wrong as, \u201cWhoever sheds human blood, by humans shall their blood be shed; for in the image of God has God made mankind\u201d? That means we still do have the image of God, doesn\u2019t it? Or at least, that having the image of God is a valid reason to disprove of abortion? Then what is the image of God if all humans have it? Or is there something in the Hebrew that would suggest otherwise?\r\nThanks so much for your time and concern!\n\n\nBeing created in the image of God meant that Adam and Eve were holy, they had perfect knowledge of God\u2019s will, and their wills were entirely aligned with God\u2019s will. After the fall into sin, the Bible tells us that Adam had a child in his likeness and image, not God\u2019s (Genesis 5:1-3). Since the fall into sin, human beings born of sinful people have entered this world as sinners (Psalm 51:5), enemies of God (Romans 8:7) and people whose natural will is opposed to God\u2019s will (Romans 7:7-23). Despite this natural sinful condition, people still have a natural knowledge of God from creation and their conscience, and they naturally know the basics of God\u2019s law (Psalm 19:1-4; Hebrews 3:4; Romans 2:14-15).\nWhile there are some Lutheran theologians who speak of people still being made, in a limited sense, in the image of God insofar as they have intellect and will, it is more consistent with Scripture to say that the image of God was lost through the fall into sin and is restored in Christians.\nGenesis 9:6 and James 3:9 are passages that some theologians cite to indicate that after the fall into sin people are born in the image of God in a limited sense. When we understand the image of God especially denoting holiness and loving only that which God loves, then we see those particular passages speaking of the original condition of people, which is no longer the case because of sin.\nEach person receives life from God (Acts 17:25), and only God or his representatives in government have the right to end a person\u2019s life (Deuteronomy 32:39; Romans 13:4). God\u2019s fifth commandment forbids murder, and that includes abortion.\nFinally, the image of God is being restored in Christians (2 Corinthians 3:18; Ephesians 4:24; Colossians 3:10), and it will be fully restored when Christians leave this world of sin (Psalm 17:15; 1 Corinthians 13:9-12; 1 John 3:2)."}
{"prompt": "Sin and Satan", "completion": "I am asking this on behalf of a friend. I learned about this in a recent Bible study where we looked at these questions. Is there free will in heaven? Did Satan have a taste of heaven before he revolted? How long was the time between when creation and when Adam and Eve were tempted and sinned for the first time?\n\n\nIn heaven, God\u2019s people will have perfect freedom of will. They will thrill to do whatever pleases God. As sin and its effects will be removed completely (Revelation 21:4), there will be no evil for God\u2019s people to choose.\nSatan and other evil angels once enjoyed a perfect existence in the presence of God, but their rebellion against God led to their expulsion from heaven and sentencing to hell (2 Peter 2:4; Jude 6).\nScripture does not give us a timetable for the fall of the angels or the fall of Adam and Eve. We know from Genesis 1 and 2 that God\u2019s creation was initially perfect. Genesis 3 then presents us with Satan (Revelation 20:2) tempting Eve, so the fall of Satan and other angels took place in the time period after Genesis 1 and 2 and before Genesis 3.\nWhat we do know with certainty is that Jesus Christ came into the world to defeat Satan (1 John 3:8). Jesus crushed Satan\u2019s power (Genesis 3:15) by his holy life, sacrificial death and glorious resurrection. God now promises that with his strength we can defend ourselves from Satan\u2019s attacks (Ephesians 6:10-17; James 4:7)."}
{"prompt": "Faith and doubt", "completion": "Despite being baptized in a WELS church as an infant and raised in the faith all my life, lately I've begun to question the validity of my faith. More specifically, I worry that my faith is based only on fear of God's wrath, rather than the promises of the gospel. I worry that my contrition is just self-pity and neurosis, and that the gospel is something I tell myself to make me feel better. Though I understand the concepts intellectually and appear to be religious to others, I worry that I have rejected God's blessings on a deeper, spiritual level. I even fear that my own worries are a sign of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit; after all, if I had true faith, I wouldn't be so selfishly introspective and fearful. I'm not despairing yet, but I'm close. What should I do? Can I do anything?\n\n\n\u201cI do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!\u201d (Mark 9:24) That was the confession and request of a father who came to Jesus for help for his demon-possessed son. Many Christians can identify with that man\u2019s words.\nBecause of the Holy Spirit\u2019s working in our hearts, you and I profess faith in Jesus Christ as our Savior. Yet, we know and confess that there is much room for growth in our faith. Doubt and worry can chip away at our trust in God. Doubt and worry often take place when we focus on ourselves. Doubt and worry can lessen and disappear when we focus more on the gospel of Jesus Christ (Hebrews 12:2).\nThat is reason why you and I want to immerse ourselves in the word of God\u2014reading it in our homes and hearing it in his house with the congregation of believers. That is why we want to be frequent guests at the Lord\u2019s Supper. The gospel in word and sacrament strengthens our faith and convinces us all the more that we are God\u2019s redeemed children.\nYou would be served best by speaking to your pastor. He is in a position to hear your concerns and apply God\u2019s word to your situation. Please don\u2019t let fear of embarrassment prevent you from contacting him. Our pastors welcome opportunities like this to point people to Jesus as their perfect Savior. God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Infant Baptism", "completion": "Should we wait to have babies baptized until the next Sunday after the birth? Or should we employ the sacrament as soon as possible in the hospital? There is freedom in this area, but why do we wait, and what do we say about babies that die then before they were baptized? \n\n\nConsidering that people are conceived and born in sin and have a need for the forgiveness of sins (Psalm 51:5), there is reason to be baptized very early in life. \u201cHow early?\u201d is a question the Bible does not answer. While God instructed Old Testament believers to circumcise a male infant when the child was eight days old, the Bible presents no timetable for baptizing infants. Still, baptizing sooner rather than later makes a great deal of sense. If there is unnecessary delay in administering Baptism and death takes place, then we are left with trying to address another question the Bible does not specifically answer: \u201cWhat happens to children who die without Baptism?\u201d\nCertainly, the Bible teaches that Christian faith saves, and unbelief\u2014not the lack of Baptism\u2014condemns. Jesus said, \u201cWhoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned\u201d (Mark 16:16). We baptize our children early in life because we know the Holy Spirit graciously works through Baptism to change hearts (Titus 3:4-6).\nWhen I served as a parish pastor in the midwestern part of our country, numerous parents requested Baptism of their children in the hospital before they ventured out on snow-packed roads. A reaffirmation of Baptism then took place later on in a worship service. When I served as a parish pastor in the southern part of our country, some parents requested Baptism of their children in the hospital, but the reasons were not weather related. They simply saw the need for Baptism and wanted their children to receive the benefits of Baptism as early in life as possible. I was happy to carry out their requests\u2014and also have a reaffirmation of Baptism in a later worship service.\n\u201cLet the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these\u201d (Matthew 19:14). Jesus\u2019 words illustrate his love for children. Christian parents show their love for their children and for Jesus when they have their children baptized."}

Conscience (Romans 14, 1 Corinthians 8) will guide Christians in their attitudes toward an activity mentioned in your question.\nCertainly, there can be sinful attitudes involved if a person\u2019s desire is simply to inflict pain on someone else, but then that could also be said about other contact sports\u2014even football.\n1 Corinthians 10:31 provides guidance for Christians as they face everyday choices in life: \u201cSo whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Concern for grandson", "completion": "My 23-year-old grandson wears Goth clothes, spikes, skulls, black fingernails and eyeliner but dresses more appropriately for church. How worried should I be about the message it sends to people he meets outside church?\n\n\nYour grandson\u2019s attitudes might differ from other people who dress like him, but people will not know that unless they speak with him. His outward appearance ties him to others who dress like him, and observers often identify those individuals with attitudes of anger and pessimism.\nIf your grandson does not wish to be misidentified from a distance, it would be in his best interests to disassociate himself from those who dress like him. Of course, if your grandson shares the attitudes of anger and pessimism of those who dress like him, that calls for a different approach: he would be served best by speaking to his pastor.\nWhile the Bible does not lay out a particular dress code for worshipers, it is good to know that your grandson dresses \u201cmore appropriately for church.\u201d Thinking of others (Philippians 2:4) finds application in our words, our actions, our demeanor and even in our appearance.

My husband is confused because, as his wife and partner, he feels there should be no limits to what we can do/enjoy in our relationship.  I'm not talking about extra partners, or anything like that- just the two of us in a relationship.\n\n\nGod designed sexual activity to take place in marriage. The Bible does not provide detail regarding the sexual activity that takes place between a man and a wife. Certainly, the attitude of selflessness and consideration of the other spouse (1 Corinthians 7:1-5) will shape a marriage\u2019s sexual activity.\nThe Bible is very clear regarding the subject of sexual activity outside marriage. The Bible condemns such activity (Hebrews 13:4)."}
{"prompt": "Meeting young adults' needs", "completion": "I see a need for some kind of program for college graduates as they move on from college campuses and start out on their own in a new city. It is a very lonely time for them. They do not have \"built-in\" friends as they have their whole life. Now they are out on their own, starting a new career, and need Christian contacts and a way to feel they fit in at church. In your 20's you don't want to go to church alone. People at church don't seem to connect with a single 20-something. Once or twice at church having this experience and they write it off. How can we connect with these young adults and get them involved with others their age and interested in continuing their lives with God as a major part of it? I have 5 children, and I think they all have gone through this or are still struggling with it.\n\n\nI agree wholeheartedly with your concerns. Young Christians need connections to Christian peers. Those connections can lead to important friendships, Bible studies and meaningful service projects.\nAs you probably know from congregational life, new programs can get started when people see needs and then seek to meet them. Perhaps it is speaking to your pastor or other congregational leaders. Maybe it is contacting synodical leadership. Needs like this could possibly be met by neighboring congregations coordinating their efforts and combining their resources. When we understand that the people you are talking about are the future of our church, then the need you identified becomes all the more important.\nWELS Commission on Discipleship has resources for men\u2019s and women\u2019s ministries.

{"prompt": "The blessings of the Lord's Supper", "completion": "Over the past 10 years or so I have come upon a few people who say that in Communion we are not receiving the forgiveness of sins, but the reassurance that our sins are forgiven because of what Jesus has done for us. He paid the price to forgive our sins, and we have that immediately when we repent and ask for forgiveness. They say that this would be \"confusion\" as to which one really forgives the sin, the death of Christ, or the receiving of the sacrament, and our God \"is not a God of confusion.\" In the words of institution He says, \"This is my blood of the new testament which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.\" Matt.26:28. His blood was poured out for the forgiveness of sins when He died. Is that reference also to the blood received in the sacrament - that it is forgiving our sins as we drink it?  Is the sacrament a remembrance that strengthens our faith and reassures us of our forgiveness, or is it forgiveness at the moment, even though we already are forgiven? Mark 14:22-26, Luke 22:18-20, and I Cor. 11:23-25 do not mention forgiveness of sins, but in remembrance of Jesus. The thought that I might not have this doctrine right scares me.\n\n\nKeep in mind what you learned in your Catechism instructions. \u201cWhat blessings do we receive through this eating and drinking? That is shown us by these words: \u2018Given\u2019 and \u2018poured out for you for the forgiveness of sins.\u2019 Through these words we receive forgiveness of sins, life, and salvation in this sacrament. For where there is forgiveness of sins, there is also life and salvation.\u201d [Luther\u2019s Catechism. Holy Communion. Second.] \u201cHow can eating and drinking do such things? It is certainly not the eating and drinking that does such things, but the words \u2018Given\u2019 and \u2018poured out for you for the forgiveness of sins.\u2019 These words are the main thing in this sacrament, along with the eating and drinking. And whoever believes these words has what they plainly say, the forgiveness of sins.\u201d [Luther\u2019s Catechism. Holy Communion. Third.]\nThe quotations from the Catechism rightly put the emphasis on the gospel: the good news of forgiveness through Jesus Christ. The gospel in the Word alone or the gospel in the sacraments offers and gives the forgiveness of sins, life, and salvation.\nThrough his perfect life and sacrificial death, Jesus won forgiveness of sins for a world of sinners (1 John 2:2). His glorious resurrection verified that (Romans 4:25). Through the gospel, the Holy Spirit changes hearts, strengthens faith and gives people the forgiveness of sins that Jesus won (Romans 1:16).\nFinally, when we celebrate the Lord\u2019s Supper \u201cin remembrance\u201d of Jesus, we call to mind the forgiveness of sins Jesus won with his body and blood\u2014the same body and blood we receive in the sacrament\u2014in, with and under the bread and wine. The words of Jesus that we focus on and remember \u2013 \u201cGiven\u201d and \u201cpoured out for you\u201d \u2013 are gospel.\nI hope this helps clarify your understanding of this precious meal."}
{"prompt": "Voting in national or local elections", "completion": "If women are prohibited from congregational voting because that constitutes exercising authority over men, does the WELS prohibit or discourage women voting in national or local elections for the same reason? If not, why not? Why are women prohibited from exercising authority over men through voting in congregational votes, but not in secular votes? \n\n\nWhile the Bible makes direct application of the principles of the one leading (head) and the one yielding (helper) in marriage and the church, it does not do so regarding life in society\u2014where the majority of people do not recognize or follow scriptural principles. That means that when it comes to a matter such as voting in national or local elections, Christian women will reach decisions on the basis of conscience and reason.\nThe October 15, 2019 Together newsletter contained this information: \u201cAnother major decision of the COP was to accept the work of a committee that has produced a restatement of our synod\u2019s doctrinal position on the God-given roles of man and women. \u2018Male and Female in God\u2019s Word\u2019 does not represent any change in our synod\u2019s position; rather it is intended to clarify and expand on several aspects of the issue that are not fully addressed in the current WELS doctrinal statement. An accompanying Bible study has also been produced. These materials will be made available later this fall for study and discussion at pastor and teacher conferences and in congregations.

It does condemn the immoral thoughts and desires that one usually associates with masturbation. Following are thoughts from responses to similar questions.\n\u201cThe WELS Catechism refers you to the following passages from God\u2019s Word. I Thessalonians 4:3-5; Ephesians 5:3-5; Ephesians 5:12; and Matthew 5:27-29. As you read these passages you come across such phrases as \u2018God\u2019s Will,\u2019 \u2018avoid sexual immorality,\u2019 \u2018control his own body,\u2019 \u2018not in passionate lust,\u2019 \u2018No immoral . . . person . . . has any place in the kingdom of God,\u2019 \u2018There must not be even a hint of sexual immorality\u2026obscenity, foolish talk, or coarse joking.\u2019 \u2018It is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret,\u2019 and \u2018You have heard that is was said, \u2018Do not commit adultery.\u2019 But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.\u2019 It is obvious that God forbids all impure words and lustful thoughts.\u201d On the contrary, Scripture says, \u201cWhatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable\u2026think about such things\u201d (Philippians 4:8).\n\u201dMasturbation is self-stimulation to some form of arousal and climax. God gave sex as a gift and a blessing to human beings for marriage with a life-long partner of the opposite sex. Self-stimulation is a corruption of God\u2019s gift and blessing of sex.\n\u201cGod\u2019s Word also says that we should do all things to the glory of God (I Corinthians 10:31). \u2018Solo Sex\u2019 (auto eroticism) by definition seems to run in conflict with God\u2019s design at creation in making humans male and female (Genesis 2:20-25). One also wonders how one honors God with her or his body through masturbation (I Corinthians 6:12-20).\u201d\nThe Bible\u2019s instruction is to live \u201choly and godly lives\u201d (2 Peter 3:11)."}

{"prompt": "Real presence", "completion": "At what point does the body and blood of Christ appear/join the bread and wine during our service?

This is true because, when the Lord instituted this sacrament, he said, \u2018This is my body. This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins\u2019 (Matthew 26:26,28). We believe that Christ\u2019s words of institution cause the real presence\u2014not any human action. As believers receive his body and blood, they also receive the forgiveness of sins (Matthew 26:28) and the comfort and assurance that they are truly his own. Unbelievers also receive Christ\u2019s body and blood, but to their judgment (1 Corinthians 11:29).\u201d\n\u201cWe reject any attempt to set the precise moment within the celebration of the Lord\u2019s Supper when the body and blood of Christ become present. We therefore reject the view that one must believe that Christ\u2019s body and blood are present as soon as the words of consecration have been spoken and the view that one must believe that Christ\u2019s body and blood become present only at the moment of eating and drinking.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Silent prayers", "completion": "I feel like I should not worry about this, but it has been eating away at me. Silent prayer. I have been alone for 13 years and now my children are both adults. Being alone doesn't bother me, but I have always prayed constantly in my head, not out loud. I pray a morning and evening prayer and even \"talk\" to God in my head throughout the day if I need to reach out for help or to thank Him. So, I guess my question is, does He listen to me as much as those who verbally speak their prayers? In Matthew 18:20, it says, \"For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them.\u201d Are my petitions weaker for being alone and silent? I do attend church regularly and love the people and fellowship, but that is only once or twice a week and I pray every day. Again, I know I shouldn't worry because God is, well, God, and has no limitations. But, my sinful nature needs confirmation and support and I thank you for any inspiration you can provide.\n\n\nGod certainly does listen to and answer your silent prayers as much as those who verbally speak their prayers. Prayer is communication with God. Since God is all-powerful and all-knowing, that communication can be verbal or unspoken.\nThink of Hannah in the Old Testament. She prayed to the Lord without speaking (1 Samuel 1:12-13). God heard her prayer and answered it. Or, think of Abraham\u2019s servant who described \u201cpraying in my heart\u201d (Genesis 24:45). That also was a prayer God heard and answered.\nSo, keep communicating with God in prayer\u2014in spoken words or simply with thoughts. As a child of God, your words and thoughts are reaching God\u2019s throne of grace (Hebrews 4:16).\nFinally, Matthew 18:20 teaches that the Lord is present in a special way when his followers gather in his name.

What about the regular Sundays during Lent?\n\n\nYour questions, of course, concern matters of adiaphora\u2014issues that God, in the Bible, has not addressed specifically. Because of this, opinions and practices will vary.\nSome people, desirous of promoting austerity and solemnity in worship settings, speak against the use of altar flowers during the times you mentioned. Other people, advocating Christian freedom, contend that regular and judicious use of altar flowers is a way of beautifying God\u2019s house of worship.\nAll I can suggest is that congregations be ready to explain their practices. For example, because the Sundays of Lent are not counted in the 40 days of the Lenten season, some churches use altar flowers on those Sundays but not during the midweek services of Lent. A congregation with such a practice would be able to explain why they do what they do.\nOne of the principles of Christian worship (and the Christian life) is that we glorify God in our actions (1 Corinthians 10:31). To me, your questions illustrate a desire to do just that."}
{"prompt": "Antinatalism", "completion": "I have been reading about antinatalism a lot lately, and have found many Christians who believe in it.  I found this quite shocking.  They say that it is a good thing not to have children because they would probably go to hell anyways.  What is a Lutheran response to this?\n\n\nA common definition for antinatalism is \u201ca philosophy that assigns a negative value to birth.\u201d People who hold to that philosophy believe that it is morally wrong to have children. A Lutheran response to this position is a scriptural response. The Bible clearly teaches that children are blessings from a loving God (Psalm 127, 128). As can happen with other blessings from God, sinful people reject what God says about children and replace his declaration with their own thoughts.\nThe rationale for rejecting God\u2019s blessings of children\u2014\u201cbecause they would probably go to hell anyways\u201d\u2014illustrates a dark view toward life. In Baptism, God has provided the means by which he can work in the hearts of little ones and bring them into his family. Through the gospel in word and sacrament, God can nurture and strengthen Christian faith so that people can finish this life in saving faith and enjoy his eternal love (Revelation 2:10).\nChristians certainly recognize the power of Satan (Ephesians 6:12), the corruptness of the sinful nature (Romans 7:18) and the ungodly influences of the sinful world (1 John 2:15-16), but they also recognize and trust in the power of God (Philippians 1:6; 2 Timothy 1:12).\nGod grant you wisdom and strength to testify about the blessings of children as you have opportunity."}

Bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ or, they are the body and blood because of God's omnipresence?\n\n\nYou will find these statements in This We Believe: a statement of belief of WELS:\n\u201cWe believe that all who join in the Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper receive the true body and blood of Christ in, with, and under the bread and wine (1 Corinthians 10:16). This is true because, when the Lord instituted this sacrament, he said, \u2018This is my body. This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins\u2019 (Matthew 26:26,28). We believe that Christ\u2019s words of institution cause the real presence\u2014not any human action. As believers receive his body and blood, they also receive the forgiveness of sins (Matthew 26:28) and the comfort and assurance that they are truly his own. Unbelievers also receive Christ\u2019s body and blood, but to their judgment (1 Corinthians 11:29).\n\u201cWe reject the doctrine of transubstantiation, which teaches that the substance of the bread and wine are changed entirely into the body and blood of Christ. Scripture teaches that all communicants receive both the bread and wine and the body and blood of Christ (1 Corinthians 10:16).\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Planning for marriage", "completion": "Hello! \r\nPlanning for a wedding can be sometimes overwhelming and stressful. I am a very strong Christian and I believe that a marriage involves three people - God, husband, and wife. Having Christ at the center of your marriage keeps you strong in all circumstances. While planning a wedding, it can get crazy with remembering to get all the physical type things done and then we can tend to forget about the spiritual focus of a wedding. What would you recommend to make sure the spiritual focus of getting married isn\u2019t lost when planning everything else for the wedding? Thank you! \n\n\nI commend you for having such wonderful priorities when it comes to wedding planning. You recognize very well that wedding service and reception details are important, but a lifelong marriage is much more important.\nPre-marital counseling from your pastor can help maintain your spiritual priorities during the busyness of wedding planning. In addition, reading and discussing the Bible with the one you will marry can help keep your spiritual focus.\nBesides Bible reading, you might consider the following books: Marriage and Family, Building the Christian Home, and Growing Together in Christ. All are available from Northwestern Publishing House.\nGod bless you and your future marriage!"}
{"prompt": "Forgiving others", "completion": "Jesus said we are to forgive others, but does that mean we should stay in relationships with people who are toxic and manipulative? \n\n\nI am not sure which kind of relationships you have in mind. When it comes to marriage, the Bible lists unfaithfulness (Matthew 19:9) and malicious desertion (1 Corinthians 7:15) as actions that break the marriage bond and enable the other spouse to leave that relationship. Other situations can call for loving rebuke, confession and absolution to enable spouses to maintain their commitment to one another.\nWhen it comes to friendships, there could be circumstances that warrant creating distance from people who do not treat us well. If that is the case, Christians still have biblical mandates like these to guide their actions: \u201cLove your enemies\u201d (Matthew 5:44), \u201cBless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse\u201d (Romans 12:14), and \u201cGet rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice\u201d (Ephesians 4:31).\nGod bless your efforts to speak openly and honestly with people (Ephesians 4:15) and to seek their good (1 Corinthians 10:24)."}

That has not stopped people from guessing. The guesses range from physical ailments to mental torments to an actual person who was disruptive to Paul\u2019s ministry.\nEven though we do not know what Paul\u2019s problem was, we do have information related to it. There was a good purpose behind Paul\u2019s thorn in the flesh. In light of his otherworldly experience (2 Corinthians 12:2-4), the thorn in his flesh was intended to keep Paul humble.\nWe also know that God heard Paul\u2019s repeated prayers to remove his problem, but God\u2019s loving and wise answer was a \u201cno.\u201d In his wisdom and love, God left the problem in Paul\u2019s life but gave him the strength to carry out his ministry.

{"prompt": "Two kinds of eating", "completion": "What is the second type of eating in the sacrament that Lutherans confess? I don't understand how there are \"two\" types of eating.\n\n\nQuestions regarding what Lutherans confess will lead to answers from the Lutheran Confessions. The following is from the Formula of Concord. Thorough Declaration. VII. Of the Holy Supper.\n\u201cThere is, therefore, a twofold eating of the flesh of Christ, one spiritual, of which Christ treats especially John 6:54, which occurs in no other way than with the Spirit and faith, in the preaching and meditation of the Gospel, as well as in the Lord\u2019s Supper, and by itself is useful and salutary, and necessary at all times for salvation to all Christians; without which spiritual participation also the sacramental or oral eating in the Supper is not only not salutary, but even injurious and damning [a cause of condemnation].\n\u201cBut this spiritual eating is nothing else than faith, namely, to hear God\u2019s Word (wherein Christ, true God and man, is presented to us, together with all benefits which He has purchased for us by his flesh given into death for us, and by His blood shed for us, namely, God\u2019s grace, the forgiveness of sins, righteousness, and eternal life), to receive it with faith and appropriate it to ourselves, and in all troubles and temptations firmly to rely, with sure confidence and trust, and to abide in the consolation that we have a gracious God, and eternal salvation on account of the Lord Jesus Christ. [He who hears these things related from the Word of God, and in faith receives and applies them to himself, and relies entirely upon this consolation (that we have God reconciled and life eternal on account of the Mediator, Jesus Christ), \u2013 he, I say, who with true confidence rests in the Word of the Gospel in all troubles and temptations, spiritually eats the body of Christ and drinks His blood.]\n\u201cThe other eating of the body of Christ is oral or sacramental, when the true, essential body and blood of Christ are also orally received and partaken of in the Holy Supper, by all who eat and drink the consecrated bread and wine in the Supper\u2014by the believing as a certain pledge and assurance that their sins are surely forgiven them, and Christ dwells and is efficacious in them, but by the unbelieving for their judgment and condemnation, as the words of the institution by Christ expressly declare, when at the table and during the Supper He offers His disciples natural bread and natural wine, which He calls His true body and true blood, at the same time saying: Eat and drink. For in view of the circumstances this command evidently cannot be understood otherwise than of oral eating and drinking, however, not in a gross, carnal, Capernaitic, but in a supernatural, incomprehensible way; to which afterwards the other command adds still another and spiritual eating, when the Lord Christ says further: This do in remembrance of Me, where He requires faith [which is the spiritual partaking of Christ\u2019s body].\u201d [Concordia Triglotta. Page 995. Emphasis in the original]\nIn short, one kind of \u201ceating\u201d (John 6:54) is receiving Jesus Christ in faith. Another kind of eating receives Jesus\u2019 body and blood in, with, and under the bread and wine."}
{"prompt": "Church visitors", "completion": "Generally speaking, how welcoming is the WELS church to visitors?  Since the denomination shares minimal fellowship with other church bodies, can I expect to receive the cold shoulder or shunning?  Lastly, why are sermons in the WELS church so brief?  Relatively speaking,13-15 minutes is much shorter than other Reformed Churches I have visited.  Additionally, the local WELS church I watched online did not use his Bible, during the sermon and all in all it seemed very simple and shallow in content.  Lastly, if you had to pick just one, what would you identify as the biggest obstacle/challenge the WELS is currently confronting?  Thank you!\n\n\nLike other church bodies, each of our congregations can have a personality of its own. Tradition, culture and local leadership are some factors that can help shape a congregation\u2019s personality. I would like to think that our congregations are welcoming to visitors. Could some of our congregations grow in that regard? Probably. Undoubtedly, there is room for growth in welcoming visitors in any gathering of Christians in any location.\nI would not expect you to receive the cold shoulder or be shunned if you visited one of our congregations. Do keep in mind though that the ways in which visitors and guests are acknowledged and welcomed can vary from congregation to congregation.\nSermon length is also going to differ from one church to another. Even within a congregation, sermon length might vary from week to week. Factors such as Holy Communion distribution and special singing can impact sermon length. When it comes to the length of a sermon or a pastor\u2019s use of the Bible, I would encourage you not to let an experience with a congregation describe an entire church body.\nWhat is our church body\u2019s biggest obstacle or challenge? We do not have a list, so I can offer only a personal observation. Our challenge is to be faithful to God and his Word in the face of growing opposition to God and his Word (2 Timothy 3:1-5).\nFinally, you might be interested to know that WELS is in fellowship with over 30 church bodies throughout the world. This link will provide you with more information.\nI hope you do visit one of our churches and receive a warm welcome. God bless you."}

{"prompt": "Prayer and fasting", "completion": "Is there a reason why we as the WELS don\u2019t appear to emphasize fasting as a Christian discipline?  (Or maybe we do, and it\u2019s just been my experience to have not heard much about it?) If a believer is considering a fast as a means to draw closer to God in prayer, how would one go about it?  Thank you!\n\n\nFasting falls in the area of Christian freedom, so an emphasis on that practice will vary from person to person.\n\u201cAs is the case with any adiaphoron, motives for fasting can be important. Some of the literature I have seen speaks of fasting serving the purpose of \u2018assisting and enhancing\u2019 our prayers. In view of that, you may want to ask yourself: \u2018Am I thinking in any way that God is going to hear and answer my prayers because of something I am doing? Am I fasting like the Pharisees\u2014thinking that fasting will put me in a better standing with God and make me superior to non-fasting Christians?\u2019 Any thoughts like these would rule out fasting.\u201d\nThe paragraph above is from a February 2015 column in Forward in Christ. This link will take you to that column. It will address the subject of fasting with more detail than I can provide here."}
{"prompt": "Organist honorarium", "completion": "I'm just curious as to the average reimbursement that organists may be getting for playing for a service.  Our congregation is in the process of possibly modifying our policy in this area.  We currently pay the organist/pianist $30 per service.  Thank you.\n\n\nI do not believe I will be able to help you much with your congregation\u2019s assessment and planning. It has been years since WELS last surveyed congregations regarding the honoraria they provide their organists. A number I can reference is what the Synodical Council recently approved for reimbursing congregations when their \u201cpersonnel need to be away from their vocations while serving the synod voluntarily for a specified term\u201d \u2013 $82 for a single service.\nIf you are not able to find a common or average honorarium for organists or pianists to use as a guide for your purposes, perhaps you and your congregation could simply take a philosophical approach to the reimbursement you provide. Maybe you could arrive at a reimbursement figure by asking and answering questions like these: \u201cWhat value do we place on having organists/pianists to assist us in our worship? At a time when many congregations within and outside our fellowship struggle to find and retain organists/pianists, what does our reimbursement say to our organists/pianists? How can we show our appreciation for the time our organists/pianists commit to finding music for Sunday services, practicing it and then playing it in our worship services? What does the amount of reimbursement say about the excellence in worship for which our congregation is striving? Are there ways our congregation could help organists/pianists build a music library?\u201d\nA worship and music leader in our church body has made this observation: \u201cHonoraria or salaries for organists are best understood when related to goals set for music in worship. A congregation wanting to encourage excellence and creativity may set higher rates than a congregation (maybe without really thinking about it) being content in the status quo.\u201d\nGod bless your congregation\u2019s worship life and your management of his resources. May he guide you as you imitate King David\u2019s actions: \u201cI will sing and make music to the Lord\u201d (Psalm 27:6)."}
{"prompt": "Church sales", "completion": "I was wondering about raffles, tag sales and other type events in the church. I was raised in the conservative Lutheran church and our churches were always self- supporting, which I still favor. What is WELS' view on this? Is it just an opinion of man all of these years that giving come from the church rather than sales to the public to help support them?\n\n\nThere is no synodical policy on the activities mentioned in your question. Differing local circumstances can lead to different practices. What I can do is pass along some observations from personal ministry experiences.\nWhat congregations will want to keep in mind is the impression given by such sales. Congregational fundraising in the community can reinforce what many people wrongly think in the first place\u2014that \u201call the church is concerned about is money.\u201d Congregational fundraising in the community can reinforce work-righteous thinking in the minds of the unchurched, leading them to conclude that, if they have contributed something, \u201cI\u2019ve given to God, so I\u2019ve done my duty.\u201d Congregational fundraising in the community can undermine a church\u2019s efforts to encourage its members to grow in their management of God\u2019s blessings by relying on community revenue. Congregational fundraising in the community can lead people to think that the church cannot survive on its own but needs their resources.\nCongregations might utilize community outreach efforts, including the sales you mentioned, to establish connections with their neighbors. As noted above, congregations will want to balance their exercise of Christian freedom with proper concern for all involved.\nIn addition, sales events within congregations can provide members with a service or product they might purchase elsewhere, and by purchasing said service or product, members are not diverting their regular offerings with these purchases.\nYour questions are reminders to keep biblical principles of stewardship of money in mind: God owns everything (Psalm 24:1). We do not own a thing. God entrusts his possessions to us for faithful management of them (Matthew 25:14-30). It is love for God and gratitude for his love that provides the motivation for giving back to God what is his in the first place (2 Corinthians 5:15; 1 John 4:19). You and I have reason for planning our giving and planning offerings that are proportionate to how God has blessed us individually (1 Corinthians 16:2)."}
{"prompt": "Sorcery and witchcraft", "completion": "I'm curious to know why the definition for \"sorcery\" changes in Galations and the book of Revelation.  In these two books it is a Greek word, pharmakeia.   In the other books of the Bible, throughout the NT and OT, it's a Hebrew word meaning witchcraft.  Why does this change?  In the Book of Revelation it states how all the nations will be deceived by the sorcery (Greek) of men (18:23).  Can you please offer some insight into this?\n\n\nThe Greek word pharmakeia has the idea of \u201cthe administering of drugs; poisoning.\u201d The word then came to be associated with \u201csorcery, magic and the magic arts.\u201d The word occurs only three times in the New Testament: Galatians 5:20; Revelation 9:21 and Revelation 18:23.\nThe New International Version (2011) translates the word as \u201cwitchcraft\u201d in Galatians 5:20, \u201cmagic arts\u201d in Revelation 9:21 and \u201cmagic spell\u201d in Revelation 18:23. Using those different words illustrates the shadings in meaning that a word from another language can have and how translators seek to reflect those shadings. Using those different words also demonstrates that we are not to expect an exact word-for-word rendering when translating from one language to another.\nWhile the specific words in the passages above vary slightly, the meaning is clear and consistent: the Bible condemns any practice that seeks power that is, in the end, associated with Satan."}
{"prompt": "Miscarriages and stillborn children", "completion": "Is there any insight into what happens to a baby that is miscarried or stillborn?  Are there specific references in the Bible that lead to your answer?  \n\n\nThe Bible does not specifically address your question. The Bible teaches that people are conceived and born with a sinful nature (Psalm 51:5; John 3:6). The Bible teaches that faith in Jesus saves, while unbelief condemns (Mark 16:16). The Bible teaches that God works faith through his gospel (Romans 10:17). Since the Bible does not specifically address your question, our course of action is to entrust these children to a wise, just and loving God."}
{"prompt": "WELS and Evangelical", "completion": "You hear the word \"evangelical\" thrown around in the media as a generic word for a conservative Protestant.  What does it mean that the WELS is evangelical?\n\n\nThe following excerpts from a column in the April 2007 Forward in Christ address your question nicely.\n\u201cSome of our congregations retain the name \u2018Evangelical.\u2019 They put Ev. as part of their name. Perhaps many people have no knowledge that Ev. is short for evangelical. Because it\u2019s a long word, sign makers find it hard to put all that on the sign out in front. So the sign reads \u2018St. Mark\u2019s Ev. Lutheran Church\u2019 or \u2018Trinity Ev. Lutheran Church.\u2019\n\u201cEvangelical has come to mean a group of Protestant Christians. In the media they are usually considered conservative Christians. They often are politically active. Evangelicals are different from fundamentalists. Fundamentalists assert five fundamentals: inerrancy of the Scripture, the virgin birth, the vicarious atonement, the physical resurrection of Jesus, and the authenticity of Christ\u2019s miracles. Evangelicals agree that the inerrancy of Scripture is important and that God is triune. The difference seems to be in their activism\u2014a desire to make society more godly.\n\u201cAlthough \u2018evangelical\u2019 still seems to stand for people who espouse Christian values, the term has been diluted to include almost everyone who espouses values embodied in the Ten Commandments. There is little room for differences about human depravity, bondage to sin, the millennium, or the sacraments. These things are left open and non-essential.\n\u201cSo are we \u2018evangelical?\u2019 After all we do hold rather conservative views, and our churches are labeled \u2018Ev.\u2019 or \u2018evangelical.\u2019 We are members of a synod that even has evangelical in its name, the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod. We could even agree with the five teachings of fundamentalists.\n\u201cBut we are different! Our congregations used the word \u2018evangelical\u2019 long before the popular religious movement of the past few decades. Many were established a century or more ago. Our synod was founded in 1850 and used the word \u2018evangelical\u2019 as part of its name.\n\u201cSo what do we mean? Evangelical describes an approach and attitude that is centered on the gospel of Jesus Christ. That definition of the word has almost disappeared today. One does not hear an emphasis on the suffering, death, and resurrection of Jesus very often in the media\u2019s description of evangelicals. One might wonder if evangelicals have forgotten it too. We could ask if they have turned more toward conservative activism than proclaiming the forgiveness of sins through Jesus and victory over death by his resurrection.\n\u201cWe are evangelical in that sense\u2014centered on Jesus Christ and his message of forgiveness, life, and salvation.\n\u201cWe are evangelical Lutherans. Some will scratch their heads and ask, \u2018What is an evangelical Lutheran?\u2019 At that point, the door swings open for our witness to Jesus, who suffered, died, and rose again to give us forgiveness, life, and salvation by grace through faith. It\u2019s all about Jesus. That\u2019s the kind of evangelical we should be.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "\"Being saved\"", "completion": "I have been reading the newly published Evangelical Heritage Version of the Bible (EHV) translated by Confessional Lutherans and so far I am highly impressed, and this translation is truly a blessing.  However, I am concerned that in several places rather than stating \"saved\" it states \"being saved.\"  This confuses me. I know that we, as Confessional Lutherans, believe teach and confess that one is saved, so from a Confessional Lutheran standpoint how is that we are \"being saved\"? What exactly does this mean? Also, why, when the KJV does not translate these verses this way, why does the EHV? I've read all of Christian Dogmatics by Mueller, and, to my knowledge, it does not explain anywhere that we are \"being saved,\" but that we are saved. Any clarification into these matters would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.\n\n\nI do not know which specific Bible passages you might have in mind, but the Evangelical Heritage Version (EHV) is not unique in including \u201cbeing saved\u201d in its translation. For example, the New International Version (both 1984 and 2011), the English Standard Version (ESV) and the Christian Standard Bible (CSB) are some of the translations that include \u201cbeing saved\u201d in their translations of 1 Corinthians 1:18 and 2 Corinthians 2:15\u2014as does the EHV. Those translations are accurate renderings of the present participle Greek verbs in those passages.\nSo what does \u201cbeing saved\u201d mean? Certainly, the Bible speaks of God accomplishing our salvation in the past (Ephesians 2:5, 8). Passages like 1 Corinthians 1:18 and 2 Corinthians 2:15 speak of Christians presently enjoying God\u2019s gift of salvation. Similarly, a passage like John 3:36 tells Christians that they presently have eternal life.\nI hope this helps."}

{"prompt": "Choosing cremation", "completion": "Is there any reason that I should not choose cremation?\n\n\nThere is nothing in the Bible that prohibits cremation. It lies in the area of Christian freedom.\nThere was a time when some voices in the Christian church cautioned against cremation. In a day and age when some unbelievers utilized cremation as a way to defy God (\u201cLet\u2019s see if this supposed God can put me back together some day.\u201d), some Christians advocated that followers of the Lord not cremate their bodies, so as not to be identified with unbelievers or an activity associated with some unbelievers.\nThat type of taunting has largely disappeared, so Christians today who make use of cremation are not likely to be confused with unbelievers. The choice of cremation over burial often includes ecological, economical and convenience factors. In the end, cremation essentially speeds up the process that occurs with traditional burial: \u201cDust you are and to dust you will return\u201d (Genesis 3:19).\nSo, again, there is no right or wrong in choosing traditional burial or cremation."}
{"prompt": "Niece and grandmother", "completion": "When my niece was 3 or 4 years old, my grandma was really sick and on hospice. My niece had never met her, but while we were on our way to see my grandma, my niece told her dad that grandma had died and she was happy now. She says that my grandma came to visit her. I know that the dead don't come to visit after death, but is it possible that my grandma came to see her before she went to heaven? \n\n\nGod, of course, can do anything. While God miraculously relocated Philip after he baptized the Ethiopian eunuch (Acts 8:39-40), we do not look for or demand that God act in similar ways today.\nHaving been very young once ourselves, you and I both know that it can be challenging at times for a young child to differentiate between reality and imagination. Even adults can want something to happen so much that the event does take place in their minds.\nWhat we can be sure about is that a young Christian child and her Christian grandmother will see each other again (1 Thessalonians 4:13-18). For that, we thank and praise God."}
{"prompt": "Greek word for \"baptize\"", "completion": "Doing a google search for the Greek word baptize, I get the word \"baptizo\" or \"to immerse.\" Is this the correct translation?\n\n\nIn the last centuries of the Old Testament era, the Greek word \u201cbaptizo\u201d did mean to \u201cimmerse.\u201d By the time the New Testament was written, that word described the application of water that included immersing, washing and pouring. This illustrates how the etymology and initial usage of a word is one thing, but current usage is another matter. (Consider how the same thing is true regarding English words.)\nIt is clear from passages like Mark 7:3-4 and Luke 11:38 that the Greek word \u201cbaptizo\u201d could mean the application of water in different ways. The context in which the word occurs will drive the meaning and interpretation.\nIn the Bible, God does not specify how to apply the water in Baptism. Baptism is the application of water in connection with God\u2019s word (Matthew 28:18-19; Ephesians 5:25-26)."}
{"prompt": "Dedicating instead of baptizing", "completion": "Some churches do not baptize infants, but they dedicate them. Where do they get the idea to dedicate children instead of baptizing children?\n\n\nThe practice of those churches stems from their false doctrines. Some churches might dedicate children and not baptize them because they reject what the Bible teaches about original sin. The Bible teaches that we are sinful from the moment our life begins (Psalm 51:5; John 3:6; Romans 5:12; Ephesians 2:3).\nSome churches might dedicate children and not baptize them because they misunderstand the origin of Christian faith; they believe that people decide to believe in Jesus and that infants are not able to make that decision. The Bible teaches that saving faith is God\u2019s gift to people (Ephesians 2:8). No one decides to believe in Jesus. Saving faith is the work of the Holy Spirit in a person\u2019s heart (1 Corinthians 12:3).\nWe baptize infants because they are included in the Lord\u2019s command to baptize \u201call nations\u201d (Matthew 28:19-20), they have a need for forgiveness (Psalm 51:5) and they can believe through the power of the Holy Spirit (Matthew 18:6; Luke 18:15-17).\nA common rite for the dedication of children focuses on the parents\u2019 acknowledgement that their children are gifts from God and the parents\u2019 promise to raise their children in the Christian faith.\nWe recognize that children are gifts of God. We want parents to raise their children in the Christian faith, but we also want parents to use the means by which the Holy Spirit can plant that faith: Baptism."}
{"prompt": "People who did not die", "completion": "According to the Bible, which individuals were taken directly to heaven?\n\n\nThe Bible tells us that Enoch (Genesis 5:24; Hebrews 11:5) and Elijah (2 Kings 2:11) entered God\u2019s presence in heaven without experiencing physical death."}
{"prompt": "Jesus and the Church", "completion": "Can it be accurately stated that the husband in marriage represents the Father and that the wife represents Christ in a sense? If so, how?\n\n\nThe imagery in the Bible is that Jesus Christ is the bridegroom and the Christian Church is his bride (Hosea 2:19-20; 2 Corinthians 11:2; Ephesians 5:25-27; Revelation 19:7-8; 21:9-10).\nEphesians 5:22-33 uses the union between Jesus and the Church as the pattern for marriage between a man and a woman."}
{"prompt": "Daughter and son-in-law", "completion": "We have a daughter raised WELS who married a Catholic boy in our WELS church. At the time of their marriage classes, they did not know how they were going to raise children. She is 25 weeks pregnant and now her Catholic husband feels that they should baptize their child Catholic not WELS Lutheran. Our daughter is a teacher in a public school and wants the child to be baptized Lutheran.  Our daughter always talked about teaching Sunday School when her kids were Sunday School age.  I always taught our kids in Sunday School. I feel that there are so many Catholics that do not know even the basic Bible stories even after going to a Catholic school.  Asking for your help in this situation to help them decide.  \n\n\nWhile in many cases Baptism establishes membership in a visible church, we want to keep in mind that the saving faith worked in a child through Baptism establishes membership in the Holy Christian Church, the communion of saints. Because of that truth, a person is not baptized \u201cLutheran\u201d or \u201cRoman Catholic.\u201d The saving faith worked in a child through Baptism bestows the title \u201cChristian.\u201d The question that your daughter and son-in-law face is one that concerns the spiritual instruction of their child.\nObviously, it would have been better for your daughter and son-in-law to come to an agreement\u2014before their marriage\u2014on how they were going to raise their children. If they have not had a conversation comparing their churches\u2019 teachings to the Bible, now would be a good time. Your daughter could use This We Believe, a statement of belief of WELS, and go through it with her husband. Both will be able to read the Bible passages that explain our church body\u2019s statement of belief. Both could do the same thing with materials from your son-in-law\u2019s church.\nThe subject matter I hope your daughter and son-in-law would spend the most time on is salvation. What does each church teach about people enjoying salvation? What does the Bible teach?\nThe Bible teaches that God saved us because of his mercy; our works do not contribute to our salvation (Romans 3:28; 4:5; Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:5-7). This is what your daughter\u2019s church teaches. The official teaching of salvation from your son-in-law\u2019s church is quite different and not biblical.\nI would encourage your daughter to speak to her pastor about this matter. One of the resources he could offer your son-in-law is a no-strings-attached Bible Information Class to learn firsthand what the Bible teaches on a variety of subjects.\nI wish you all well and pray for a peaceful resolution to this situation."}
{"prompt": "Girlfriend and pregnancy", "completion": "Recently my girlfriend and I found out we are pregnant before marriage. We took an at-home test but still have yet to go to the doctors to ensure the findings are correct. And obviously it was unexpected. And at our age and point in our relationship we\u2019re unsure if this is what we want.  Is it wrong to pray that our finding come up to be a false positive? We do not want to abort it but are unsure of if this is what we want right now.\n\n\nRegarding prayer, I do not know if you and your girlfriend have gone to God in prayer, confessing your sins and seeking his forgiveness. The possibility of a pregnancy points to sexual activity outside marriage. God forbids that (Exodus 20:14; Ephesians 5:5; 1 Thessalonians 4:3-5). So, if you have not used prayer for confession of sins, I urge you to do that.\nThe Bible\u2019s message is that God responds to a confession of sins from repentant, faith-filled hearts (1 John 1:9). Through the gospel in word and sacrament, God provides his message of the forgiveness of sins won by his Son, Jesus Christ.\nA godly response to the message of forgiveness is using life God\u2019s way. A good, proper course of action for you and your girlfriend is to refrain from sexual activity before marriage (Hebrews 13:4).\nI am so glad to read that abortion is not an option, should there be a pregnancy. Adoption could be something for both of you to think about if there is a pregnancy.\nWhen it comes to your prayers about this situation, you can be certain that God will hear your prayers and answer in the best possible way for all involved.\u00a0 He knows what is best and will do what is best.\nAs it is with many questions that come my way, I can tell you that you would do well to speak to your pastor. He is in a position to hear words of confession and give you personally the message of forgiveness of sins. He could also address other questions you and your girlfriend might have. God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Gay marriage stance", "completion": "Hello. I\u2019m curious want your stance on gay marriage is. As part of the LGBTQ community, I\u2019m trying to find a church that\u2019s open to it. Thank you for your time.\n\n\nI can provide you with this statement from our church body:\n\u201cThe Bible teaches that marriage was established and given by God at the time of creation. As he designed and instituted it, marriage is the life-long union of one man and one woman (Genesis 2:24, Matthew 19:4-6). It is a relationship that is to be honored and kept pure (Hebrews 13:4; Ephesians 5:22-33). As a man and woman promise life-long faithfulness to each other as husband and wife, God himself joins them as one. Marriage is not simply a contract between two consenting individuals, nor is it merely a creation of human society, culture, or tradition. God himself instituted marriage at the time of creation, and God himself joins a man and woman in marriage today.\n\u201cThe biblical teaching on marriage emphasizes the blessings God intends to convey to those joined together in the marital relationship. Through marriage God provides partners well suited and complementary to one another. In marriage, God provides a partner who will provide encouragement and support. Marriage is also to be the God-ordained means to procreate and to establish a stable environment in which children can be nurtured both physically and spiritually. Marriage is the one context God intended for the use of the blessing of sexual intimacy, where the sexual union of one man and woman is an expression of love and oneness rather than a sinful satisfaction of lust. Finally, since we live in a fallen world, in marriage God provides a restraint for selfishness and sin as each partner strives to live the pure life that God intends for his people (1 Thessalonians 4:3-8).\n\u201cThis is the Bible\u2019s teaching about the origin, definition, and nature of marriage. For that reason it is also the doctrine of the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod. Every congregation and called worker accepts the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments as the written Word of God and the only rule and norm of faith and practice. That marriage is the God-ordained union of one man and one woman is the clear teaching of the Bible, and therefore is the teaching and confession of the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod.\n\u201cWe believe that marriage is the sacred, life-long union between one man and one woman. Therefore, our pastors will not officiate in any marriage ceremony or celebration and our church sanctuary may not be used for any activities related to a marriage ceremony or celebration that is inconsistent with these beliefs.\u201d\nI invite you to speak in person to any of our pastors to follow up on this statement and understand better what the Bible teaches about marriage."}
{"prompt": "Differences between WELS and LCMS", "completion": "What is the difference between WELS and the Missouri Synod? Thank you.\n\n\nThe main differences are in the categories of church and ministry, the application of fellowship principles, and the roles of men and women.\nThere are many, many essays on the Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary Essay File that document the history, theology and practices of the two synods, and their relationship with one another throughout the years. This link will take you to those essays.\nYou will also find other questions about WELS and LCMS (The Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod) in the Church and Ministry category of the Q & A section of this website.\nYou might also be interested in A Tale of Two Synods, a book that is available from Northwestern Publishing House.\nFinally, you may or may not be aware that representatives of WELS, ELS (Evangelical Lutheran Synod) and LCMS have met annually since 2012. As a Together newsletter noted recently, \u201cThese meetings are intended to provide a forum that increases mutual understanding of each synod\u2019s doctrine and practice and to establish good lines of communication between the synods. The discussions have been helpful in identifying where the synods agree and where differences remain.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Voting in WELS", "completion": "I became a WELS member in 1968 when I married my husband who was born and raised WELS.  I love being a member of a church that is totally based on the teachings of the Bible.  The only thing I have a hard time understanding is why women are not allowed to vote in the WELS.  Where is this decided in the Bible?   Thank you.\n\n\nAs can be the case with other contemporary issues of church life, the Bible does not specifically address the subject of authoritative voting in church assemblies. Our practice is based on applying general scriptural principles to our form of church governance.\nThis section of This We Believe: a Statement of Belief of the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod addresses your question: \u201cWe believe that women may participate in offices and activities of the public ministry except where that work involves authority over men (1 Timothy 2:11,12). This means that women may not serve as pastors nor participate in assemblies of the church in ways that exercise authority over men (1 Corinthians 11:3; 14:33-35).\u201d\nThe restriction of those actions listed above does not in any way diminish the status of Christian women in the sight of God. Scripture says to Christians: \u201cSo in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham\u2019s seed, and heirs according to the promise\u201d (Galatians 3:26-29).\nYou might be interested in reading a Together newsletter that described the materials and process by which WELS is studying a restatement of our doctrinal statement \u201cScriptural Principles of Man and Woman Roles.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Lord's Supper elements", "completion": "A question was recently brought up about what type of grape juice to use for Communion for those who cannot drink wine. Does it need to 100% grape juice or is a grape juice that includes apple juice acceptable? Thank you.\n\n\nThe evangelists (Matthew 26:29; Mark 14:25; Luke 22:18) use the term \u201cfruit of the vine\u201d in their accounts of the institution of the Lord\u2019s Supper. Historically, we know that wine\u2014often diluted with water\u2014was used at the Passover meal. The lack of refrigeration in biblical times also meant that the juice harvested from grapes months earlier would either have spoiled or become fermented. \u201cFruit of the vine\u201d would rule out apple juice as an earthly element for the sacrament."}
{"prompt": "Family and daughter", "completion": "I am interested in how to more openly discuss with my daughter who says that she is a lesbian on how it is not right in God's ways. She shuts herself down to us most of the time and says that we do not love her. We have tried to make it known to her that we do still love her but we are not able to accept her lifestyle. \n\n\n\u201cTell the truth, actively love, point to a loving Father, offer hope, affirm gender.\u201d Those are the headings of an article that can give you some guidance in speaking with your daughter. The article is one of many good resources you will find on the website of Christian Life Resources, a WELS-affiliated ministry. Perhaps you can share the resources with your daughter and agree to have a conversation on the contents of the resources.\nWhen you speak with your daughter, do let her know again and again that you are pointing her to what God says in the Bible because you love God and you love her. If you and I did not love God or our family members, we would have little reason to be concerned about what our family members did in life. But because we love God and our family, we will \u201cspeak the truth in love\u201d (Ephesians 4:15) when we see family members deviating from God\u2019s will.\nAs you speak with your daughter, do be \u201cquick to listen\u201d and \u201cslow to speak\u201d (James 1:19). You will earn the \u201cright\u201d to speak with your daughter as she observes you listening to her.\nBeyond the online resources linked above, your pastor can be another valuable resource. He may have materials for you to read and share with your daughter. He can also minister to you as you reach out to your daughter.\nFinally, as you are no doubt doing, keep going to God in prayer, asking him to work in your daughter\u2019s heart through his powerful word. Prayer is \u201cpowerful and effective\u201d (James 5:16) because God is all-powerful.\nGod bless you and your family."}
{"prompt": "\"Heaven is For Real\"", "completion": "My dear friend is very excited about Colton Burpo's story, \"Heaven Is For Real.\" What is an appropriate, scriptural response to those who believe his account, and the accounts of others, of having visited heaven and returning to tell the story? Am I wrong to be skeptical because Colton and his father have sold millions of books and produced a movie,  no doubt for great monetary gain? \n\n\nIn light of a well-publicized near death experience hoax by the person featured in \u201cThe Boy Who Came Back from Heaven,\u201d there is wisdom in approaching the subject of near death experiences with cautious examination of what people report.\nGod, of course, can do anything. In both the Old and New Testaments (examples include 1 Kings 17:21-22 and Mark 5:41-42), we find accounts of people who went beyond near death experiences; they were dead and God raised them from the dead. Yet, God chose not to include in the inspired narratives any information on the experiences of the resurrected individuals.\nWith claims of near death experiences today, it is good to compare what people say about heaven with what the Bible teaches. You can do this kind of comparison by going to the Frequently Asked Questions page on the website of Heaven is For Real Ministries."}

{"prompt": "Engagement and marriage", "completion": "Is engagement tantamount to marriage?\n\n\nEngagement is the promise to marry another person. Marriage involves the legal commitment of a man and a woman to each other that is regulated by the government. Engagement is not marriage.\nIt is easy for people to conclude\u2014wrongly\u2014that engagement and marriage are the same when they look at the biblical account of Joseph and Mary (Matthew 1:18-25). At one point in time, \u201cMary was pledged to be married to Joseph\u201d (Matthew 1:18). This is not speaking of the practice of engagement that we have. Joseph and Mary had given each other their word, by means of signed papers, that they would become husband and wife. That action legally established the marriage. That explains why Joseph had thoughts of \u201cdivorcing\u201d (Matthew 1:19) Mary when he first learned of her pregnancy.\nWhile Joseph and Mary were legally married by the signing of legal papers, they did not have the right to live together as husband and wife until the time of the public wedding celebration that took place days later.\nThe customs and legal nuances of marriage in first century Palestine were quite different from our practice of engagement."}
{"prompt": "Women counselors", "completion": "I understand that as a woman I am not to have authority over men in the church. What I don't understand is why women can't have the same level of education men receive at seminary in order to hold a position in the church to teach and counsel other women. Women in the church are often not comfortable going to a male pastor with questions and life situations that men do not have an understanding of like a woman does.\r\nThank you for your time.\n\n\nI understand and agree that a woman might find it more comfortable to speak to another woman about life situations. Having that option in a congregation would be beneficial.\nWomen can certainly seek training to \u201cteach and counsel other women.\u201d An example of that would be a female staff minister. While the program plan for staff ministry at Martin Luther College contains an introductory course in the basics of Christian counseling, a woman would want to receive more in-depth training to provide regular, formal counseling in a congregation.\nYou might be interested to know that the program plan referenced above also calls for eighteen credits of theology courses. That makes for a good foundation of biblical knowledge."}
{"prompt": "Perfect joys of heaven", "completion": "Our mother recently passed away. She believed in Jesus as her Savior, so we know her soul is in heaven with Him. We miss her terribly but rejoice for the end of her earthly suffering and the beginning of her eternal joy. \r\nIs it inappropriate or otherwise questionable for us to pray to Jesus to let our mom know how much we love her, miss her, and look forward to seeing her again in heaven? \n\n\nI sympathize with you at the death of your mother. As Christians, we do deal with the sorrow of temporary separation from our loved ones. At the same time, we praise God for bringing them into his presence in heaven.\nThe Bible calls those who die in the Christian faith \u201cblessed\u201d (Revelation 14:13). Christians who die and enter the presence of God in heaven are blessed in that they are forever free from sin and its effects (Revelation 7:16-17). Christians in the presence of God in heaven are enjoying perfect peace and joy.\nFor those reasons, there is no need to try to get messages to Christians in heaven. They do not need encouragement or reassurance of any kind.\nOn the other hand, we\u2014the survivors on earth\u2014need encouragement as we continue to \u201cfight the good fight of the faith\u201d (1 Timothy 6:12). Thankfully, in the gospel God provides the encouragement and the strength we need.\nIn the Bible God also informs us that on the Last Day he will bring together all his followers (1 Thessalonians 4:13-17), and they will never be separated. Then he tells us: \u201cTherefore encourage one another with these words\u201d (1 Thessalonians 4:18). Let\u2019s continue to do just that."}
{"prompt": "Martin Luther and Jews", "completion": "What is the truth, if any, on this post that is currently making the rounds on Facebook? \"In one night, in response to Luther's anti-Semitic sermon, synagogues were burned to the ground and over 2000 Jews were slaughtered.\"  A friend posted this and would like to respond intelligently with what is or isn't true about this, citing historical facts if possible.  Thanks.\n\n\nMuch has been written about Martin Luther and his views toward Jews. An article in the October 2013 Forward in Christ provides something for you to pass along to your friend. The article addressed the question: \u201cHow can we respond to those who say that Martin Luther was an anti-Semite because of his condemnation of the Jews? My friend thinks that we Lutherans shouldn\u2019t follow such a man.\u201d The following is the response to that question and statement.\n\u201cThere are two questions here, one asking why we \u2018follow Luther\u2019 and another asking if Luther was anti-Semitic. Both questions are worth asking and answering.\nHow do Lutherans regard Luther?\n\u201cPerhaps uninformed people really think that Lutherans idolize or inappropriately revere Luther. We can assure them we don\u2019t. Rather, we cherish and thankfully embrace key concepts that God restored to their rightful place in the church through Martin Luther. By grace alone, through faith alone, by Scripture alone, and through Christ alone are truths the Reformer championed. Highlight these truths for your friend. This is what true Lutheranism is all about.\n\u201cLutherans have never believed or taught everything Luther said or wrote was correct. Luther said and wrote some things that would have better remained unspoken and unwritten. This should not be surprising when one considers how much he wrote. Let\u2019s be quick to cherish divine truths given renewed prominence through Luther and equally swift to acknowledge the man\u2019s imperfections.\nWas Luther an anti-Semite?\n\u201cAccusations of anti-Semitism against Luther usually stem from reading his 1543 tract On the Jews and Their Lies, in which the Reformer used immoderate language and gave questionable counsel on how to deal with Jews at that time. While we have never endorsed what and how he wrote in that treatise, we also believe a fair, historically-sensitive appraisal of the man and his message will show the Reformer was not anti-Semitic. Excellent books have been written on this topic, but here we must limit ourselves to these brief points:\n\u201c\u2022 Luther also wrote about Jews in sympathetic ways and rebuked European Christians for their treatment of Jews. Here\u2019s one example: \u2018The fury of some Christians (if they are to be called Christians) is damnable. They imagine that they are doing God a service when they persecute the Jew most hatefully, think everything evil of them, and insult them. . . . Whereas, according to the example of this psalm (14:7) and that of Paul (Romans 9:1), a man ought to be most heartily sorry for them and continually pray for them. . . . They ought to attract them by all manner of gentleness, patience, pleading and care\u2019 (What Luther Says: An Anthology, Vol. 2, 683).\n\u201c\u2022 Luther\u2019s attitude is more accurately characterized as anti-Judaism rather than anti-Semitism. His opposition was not racial or ethnic, but theological. He was targeting people who persistently and vigorously rejected the truth of salvation through faith alone in Jesus the Messiah and Savior of the world. Luther wrote harshly against the Roman pope and his theological supporters for the same reason.\n\u201c\u2022 Like everyone else, Luther was a child of his times. It\u2019s difficult for people today to put themselves into his historical context, yet it\u2019s unfair to judge him according to our standards of civility. Luther\u2019s language sounds cruel, but his opponents often used similar language, and literary style of the era included harsh ridicule, name calling, and deliberate excess.\n\u201cUltimately we must conclude that the treatise in question doesn\u2019t represent Luther at his best. We cannot endorse or excuse what he wrote. From a historical viewpoint, it should not surprise us that he sometimes shared unacceptable attitudes of his day. What is amazing is how often he rose above his times and advocated magnificent and eternal truth, most of all the full and free gospel of forgiveness.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "WELS and doctrine", "completion": "I listen to VCY and other religious TV shows, YouTube videos, etc.  I hear a lot of things like, you can't lose your salvation, the rapture, and other things that are opposite of WELS teaching and beliefs.  How is that there can be so many scholars (either well known or late in their years studying the Bible for a whole lifetime ) that agree on most subjects, and yet a small group, like the WELS that teaches differently?  Are we to believe that only the WELS/ELS has the correct answers to correct and proper biblical interpretation? Thank you and God bless.\n\n\nWELS is not the only church body that rejects \u201cthe perseverance of the saints\u201d (\u201conce saved, always saved\u201d) or the rapture. Other churches teach from Scripture that Christians can lose their faith (Luke 8:13; 1 Timothy 1:19). Other churches reject the rapture, understanding correctly that the events of 1 Thessalonians 4:13-17 occur on the Last Day.\nWe do not pretend to be the only church whose teachings and practices are biblical. We believe we are holding to the truths of God\u2019s word. If others accuse us of error in doctrine or practice, we are willing and interested to listen, and see what Scripture says about their claims and our confession.\nAre there other churches that accurately confess and teach the truths of God\u2019s word? Yes. We praise God for that, and we are very interested in knowing who they are. In fact, our synod\u2019s Commission on Inter-Church Relations is constitutionally charged with \u201crepresenting the synod in doctrinal discussions with other church bodies who are, or are not, in fellowship with the synod in order to \u2018extend and conserve the true doctrine and practice of the Evangelical Lutheran Church.\u2019\u201d Presently we are in fellowship with 31 church bodies throughout the world. You can find information on those churches via this website."}
{"prompt": "Lord's Supper and membership", "completion": "I am considering transferring to the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod (LCMS). I have not done so yet and I am a WELS member still. But, my current pastor told me I could not partake of the Lord's Supper with my old church should I come back for a visit, but I could worship with them. I do feel snubbed and a little hurt by my pastor's answer. I was told the reason was a doctrinal belief of the WELS. My question is this: the LCMS and WELS have the same view of the Lord's Supper in that it gives the forgiveness of sin through faith, so why can I not partake of the Lord's Supper with my old church on a visit, but worship is allowed?  And my second question is this:  would it be a sin should I stay a WELS member and participate in the Lord's Supper at an LCMS church?  I am struggling with the decision that my current pastor explained to me, and I believe it is because I feel some hurt and disbelief in the answer he gave.  Thank you.  \n\n\nWhat you will want to keep in mind is that it is agreement on all doctrines of the Bible that establishes church fellowship. While WELS and LCMS both teach that God offers and gives the forgiveness of sins in the Lord\u2019s Supper, the two church bodies are not in agreement on all doctrines of the Bible. That is why the two church bodies are not in fellowship with one another. That is why your pastor explained it would not be possible for you to receive the Lord\u2019s Supper at your former WELS congregation if you joined an LCMS congregation.\nThis practice of WELS is similar to the practice of LCMS. You will find this statement on the LCMS website: \u201cThe official position of the Synod is that not only are members of other Lutheran churches with whom we are in altar and pulpit fellowship invited to commune with us, but also that in certain extraordinary cases of pastoral care and in emergencies members of churches not in fellowship with us may be given Communion.\u201d\nIf you were to join an LCMS congregation, you could still attend the worship services of your former WELS congregation. Scripture does not place any restrictions on the proclamation of God\u2019s word. On the other hand, Scripture does not direct Christians to commune everyone. Far from that, Scripture teaches that the celebration and reception of the Lord\u2019s Supper is an expression of closeness in faith and unity with one another (1 Corinthians 10:17). That means we will ordinarily commune only those who are in doctrinal agreement with us. In addition, Scripture teaches that individuals can be guilty of receiving the sacrament to their harm (1 Corinthians 11:27-29). Concern for individuals is another reason for the historic practice of closed communion.\nScripture teaches that we are not to practice church fellowship with people who believe and teach what runs contrary to Scripture (Romans 16:17). It is wrong to go against what God says in his word.\nI encourage you to have a follow up conversation with your pastor. Share your hurt feelings with him, and study the biblical principles of fellowship with him. God bless you."}

I read Scripture (almost daily) and do journal devotions. I know my salvation was determined by Jesus Christ who died on the cross and rose again. I am a baptized believer who attends weekly worship with my family. I am not particularly social, so this can \"problematic.\" What more may I do to help myself in this area? \n\n\nThe words of Jesus that you quoted do speak of dire conditions as we move closer to the Last Day. Love for God and love for others \u201cwill grow cold.\u201d\nCould your love for God and others increase? Certainly. The same thing could be said about my love for God and others. The same thing could be said about all Christians. That is why it is not surprising to read words like these from the apostle Paul: \u201cMay the Lord make your love increase and overflow for each other and for everyone else, just as ours does for you\u201d (1 Thessalonians 3:12). There was room for growth in the hearts of the Christians in Thessalonica two thousand years ago. There is room for growth in the hearts of Christians today.\nThat room for growth does not mean that salvation is in jeopardy. Keep in mind that it is faith in Jesus Christ that saves (Mark 16:16). It is not the strong faith of the Christian that saves. Christian faith saves because it is attached to Jesus Christ, and he is strong.\nWhat I read about you is that you are taking your faith seriously. Your trust is in Jesus Christ. You are regularly hearing and reading God\u2019s word. You remember your Baptism. You have times of slipping \u201cinto an unloving spirit.\u201d Those are times when the sinful nature (Galatians 5:19-21) gets the upper hand in our lives. Especially in those times, we confess to God our unloving attitudes and we receive in faith the forgiveness of our sins. Strengthened by God\u2019s forgiveness of our sins, we strive to put down the sinful nature and follow our new self. We seek to display the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23) in daily living. And the very first item is \u201clove.\u201d\nIn light of your \u201csocial\u201d concerns, perhaps you could consider volunteer service in your congregation and community. Take inventory of your interests and gifts, and see how you might grow in reflecting the love of Jesus in your life.\nA man once came to Jesus and said, \u201cI do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!\u201d (Mark 9:24). That man spoke for many other Christians. We do believe in Jesus as our Savior, but we recognize there is room for growth in our faith and our Christian love. Thankfully, the Lord has the means to increase both: it is his gospel in word and sacrament. Keep using them faithfully. God\u2019s blessings!"}

{"prompt": "Anointing of Jesus", "completion": "A Sunday sermon on Acts 10:34-38:  \"God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power.\"  Question: before that time, was Jesus humanly aware of who He was and what His earthly mission was?\r\nAlso, John the Baptist baptizing, was this the beginning of the ritual of baptism?\n\n\nJesus\u2019 state of humiliation means that he did not make full or constant use of his power and majesty as God. Matthew 24:36 provides an example of that in the area of Jesus\u2019 knowledge. The Bible does not tell us what other information\u2014and when in his life\u2014Jesus may have chosen not to know something.\nJoseph and Mary certainly knew of Jesus\u2019 identity before he was born (Matthew 1:20-25; Luke 1:26-35). It would have been natural for them to share that information with Jesus. From the account of his childhood visit to Jerusalem (Luke 2:41-52), we see Jesus recognizing his special relationship with his heavenly Father.\nBaptism did begin with the ministry of John the Baptist."}
{"prompt": "Descendants of Adam and Eve", "completion": "Mulling over the idea of Adam and Eve and how everyone else after their children came to be, were their grandchildren products of incest?\n\n\nWith the creation of only Adam and Eve, marriage between close relatives was a necessity in the beginning of time.\nAs world population increased, that necessity disappeared, and in time God prohibited sexual relations among family members (Leviticus 19).\nSince spouses in those early marriages were unavoidably closely related, we would not call children from those early marriages \u201cproducts of incest.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Jesus and Baptism", "completion": "Did Jesus baptize any people while he was here on earth and did his twelve disciples baptize anyone?\r\nThank you for your reply.\n\n\nWe learn from John 3:22 and John 4:2 that Jesus\u2019 disciples did baptize people. There is no biblical record of Jesus baptizing anyone."}
{"prompt": "Adam and Eve", "completion": "What does it mean exactly that Eve is the mother of all the living? Does it mean that she\u2019s the mother of all the believers in Christ who will live forever because they did not die in their sins but died in Christ, meaning they are all part of the living souls in Christ and Eve is the mother of them? Considering that Eve was the first to sin, I assume she turned from her sins and turned in faith at some point and was saved and ended up going to live forever in heaven.\n\n\nAs the first person to give birth to another human being and have countless offspring, \u201cthe mother of all the living\u201d (Genesis 3:20) is certainly a description that fits Eve. But does that description go beyond physical ancestry and describe Eve\u2019s connection with people regarding their spiritual lives? Many theologians and Bible commentators advance that thought.\nHere is one example: \u201cIn faith the man fixed his attention on the one comforting detail in the entire announcement of the LORD. More was expressed by the man than the mere idea that God was indeed speaking the truth when he had indicated in the protevangelium [the first Gospel promise] that Eve would have offspring, and that for this reason she would become the mother of all the living. That in itself was a truth which was quite evident and one which would be readily believed. It would hardly be significant enough to be brought to our attention in such a solemn manner. Rather we see the conviction expressed here by Adam that since all living human beings would come forth from Eve, therefore also life in the fullest sense. Scripture often simply equates life with salvation.\n\u201cThe significant way in which Adam\u2019s naming is reported leads us to believe that he referred to the things implied in the promised victory over Satan, life in the midst of death. It is worth noting that this statement of Adam follows closely upon the announcement of physical death.\u201d\nEve\u2019s words in Genesis 4:1 and 4:25 are statements of faith in the God who promised a Savior. Such faith brings a person\u2019s soul into the presence of God in heaven when earthly life comes to an end."}
{"prompt": "Disasters and repentance", "completion": "A friend told me she remembers reading about how God sends hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, etc. because he wants us to go to church. I know sin is what causes troubles while we live on earth, but I don\u2019t remember reading what she is telling me. If it is factual, can you guide me to the chapter in the Bible that tells us that?\n\n\nMore than wanting people to go to church, God\u2019s desire is that people repent of their sins and trust in him as their Savior through the power of the Holy Spirit.\nJesus\u2019 words in Matthew 24:7 tell us to expect \u201cnatural disasters\u201d until God brings this world to an end on the Last Day. When we consider what Jesus said in Luke 13:1-9, the tragedies of this world serve a purpose of getting people\u2019s attention and awakening the need for repentance."}
{"prompt": "Modern nation of Israel", "completion": "Why is it that so many Christians and government leaders place so much importance not only on the land of Israel (especially during the end times) but on the Jews as being God's people (as in the Old Testament)?  Some even believe that we will be blessed if we help/align with the Jews.  Seems to me that the land is of little importance during Armageddon, since it will be a spiritual battle.  God's people to me are ones who believe in Jesus as their personal Savior, ask for forgiveness and repent of known sins.  By faith, by God's grace, we are saved, and not by any works or an attempt to keep the law.  This would not include Jews (Judaism).  Only 2% currently are Christians in Israel.  Am I correct on this?\n\n\nWhat can often account for people placing great importance on the nation of Israel today is a wrong understanding of biblical prophecy. Dispensational premillennialism imagines a special role for the modern nation of Israel in the end times. The Bible does not address the modern nation of Israel.\nWhen the Bible states that \u201c\u2026all Israel will be saved\u201d (Romans 11:26), it is clear from the context (Romans 9:6-8) that we are not to expect a mass conversion of the Jews prior to the Last Day. No, the \u201cIsrael\u201d of Romans 11:26 speaks of people who have the faith of God\u2019s Old Testament people:\u00a0 faith that was centered in the promised Messiah. That Messiah is Jesus, the Christ.\nDispensational premillennialism requires a greater explanation than I can provide in this response to you. You will find a lengthy treatment of that subject in End Times: Jesus is Coming Soon. Your church library may have a copy of that book. It is also available from Northwestern Publishing House.\nAs you noted, people enjoy salvation \u201cby grace, through faith.\u201d God the Holy Spirit works saving faith in people through the means of grace. We do not decide to believe or choose to follow Jesus. Christian faith is God\u2019s gift to people (Ephesians 2:9)."}
{"prompt": "The Bible and truth", "completion": "A goodly amount of what is written in the Old and New testaments is wrong, or never happened, especially the Catholic versions. An example would be the dates of the Garden of Eden and the creation of modern man.  4,000 - 6,000 years ago is obviously incorrect, because we know that modern man has been around for at least 15,000 years, but likely a lot more. So if so much of the Bible, written by man, is false, how can one believe that it is \"The Word of God\"?\n\n\nThe Bible does not state how long ago the creation of Adam and Eve took place. People have used the chronologies in the Bible to try to approximate world history, but the chronologies are incomplete, and that presents challenges to any attempts to assign dates to events.\nBecause the Bible does not state \u201cthe dates of the Garden of Eden and the creation of modern man,\u201d the charge that the Bible contains false and inaccurate information is unsubstantiated. Reasonable attempts to fill in the gaps of the biblical chronologies do place the creation of Adam and Eve below the time span you listed.\u00a0 Again, the Bible itself does not present a timeline of historical events with dates.\nGod certainly used people to write the Bible. Verbal inspiration means that the Bible writers wrote exactly what God wanted written down (1 Corinthians 2:13; 2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:21). God himself is always truthful (Numbers 23:19), and what the Bible writers wrote is truth (John 17:17).\nThat last passage, John 17:17, explains that your complaint is really with Jesus. He stated that God\u2019s word\u2014not some of it, or most of it, but all of it\u2014is truth. When the Holy Spirit convinces us of that, then we say what the psalm writer penned: \u201cAll your words are true\u201d (Psalm 119:160). I pray that through the study of God\u2019s word you come to that same confession."}
{"prompt": "Listening to Jesus", "completion": "Why does God say that the earth was made for the  devil and his angels and we have to live here with them?  A second question, why does God say if we belong to him we can hear his voice?  I worry every day because I cannot hear his voice.\n\n\nI do not know which Scripture verse you might have in mind with your question, but the Bible does not speak of God making the earth for the devil and his angels. What the Bible does state is that God has prepared hell for the devil and his angels (Matthew 25:41).\nJesus did say, \u201cI have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd\u2026My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me\u201d (John 10:16; 27). In the opening verses of John 10, Jesus used figurative language to describe how his followers listened and believed what he said: they listened and followed like sheep who knew the voice of their shepherd.\nWhen Jesus spoke of his followers listening to his voice, he did not mean that our ears will receive actual sounds from him. By \u201clistening to his voice,\u201d Jesus has in mind the idea of believing what he says and doing what he says.\nThe time will come when Jesus\u2019 followers will hear the actual voice of Jesus. On the Last Day he will say to them, \u201c\u2018Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world\u201d (Matthew 25:34). What a joy it will be to hear that!"}
{"prompt": "Simon Peter", "completion": "In Matthew 16:18 Jesus says that He will build His Church on \u201cthis rock.\u201d Catholics believe this rock to be Peter, while Lutherans seem to believe that \u201cthis rock\u201d is referring to Peter\u2019s confession of faith since it is a play on words in the Greek (Petros to Petra). My question is, if this is the case, then why would Jesus even change Peter\u2019s name in the first place? Why wouldn\u2019t he just stay Simon, instead of changing his name to Peter (rock)? What would be the point?\n\n\nJesus\u2019 words in Matthew 16:18 (\u201c\u2026you are Peter\u2026\u201d) are a statement of fact. The place in Scripture where we find Jesus speaking of giving an additional name to Simon is John 1:42 \u2013 \u201cJesus looked at him and said, \u2018You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas\u2019 (which, when translated, is Peter).\u201d\nIn Matthew 16:13-20, when God led Simon Peter to make a beautiful confession of faith in Jesus Christ, the Lord acknowledged that the disciple who answered a question addressed to all the disciples had indeed lived up to his new name, which means \u201crock.\u201d In spite of denying his Lord, Peter would continue to confess Jesus as his Savior\u2014most notably in his sermon on Pentecost (Acts 2:14-41).\nAs you noted, the Greek word for Peter is \u201cpetros.\u201d It is a masculine noun. The Greek word for the rock on which Jesus was going to build his church is \u201cpetra.\u201d It is a feminine noun. By saying he was going to build his church \u201con this rock\u201d (petra, feminine), the Lord made it clear that he was building his church on the confession that he is Savior\u2014and not on the person who made such a confession."}
{"prompt": "Jesus' public ministry", "completion": "Did Jesus start his ministry before going to the wilderness to fast?\n\n\nIn the context of Jesus\u2019 Baptism, the Bible states: \u201cNow Jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry\u201d (Luke 3:23). The 40 days of temptation by Satan followed Jesus\u2019 Baptism (Luke 4:1-2).\nWhile Jesus\u2019 public ministry began with his Baptism, we do not want to minimize the first three decades of his life. Prior to his Baptism, Jesus had been leading a quiet, holy life because he was \u201cborn under law, to redeem those under law\u201d (Galatians 4:4-5). Jesus acted as our substitute in life, keeping the law of God perfectly in our place. That holy life, along with his sacrifice on the cross as our substitute, won our forgiveness of sins."}

{"prompt": "Impure thoughts", "completion": "Is having erotic pictures of your wife a sin?\n\n\nGod designed sexual relations to take place between a man and a woman in marriage. What is sinful is having impure thoughts about a person who is not one\u2019s spouse (Matthew 5:28). Those thoughts can result from pictures and images.\nWhen it comes to our thoughts, Scripture offers this directive: \u201cFinally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable\u2014if anything is excellent or praiseworthy\u2014think about such things\u201d (Philippians 4:8)."}
{"prompt": "Marking and imposition of ashes", "completion": "Why would Christians start a tradition like the imposition of ashes with a mark on the forehead or hand when Revelation speaks of this as a sign of the beast? (It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads.) \n\n\nThe marking of people who belong to Satan (Revelation 20:4) is not a literal marking, as if they will have a visible mark on their forehead. The marking is symbolic\u2014just as Christians are described as having a seal on their foreheads (Revelation 7:3).\nSealing or marking denotes ownership. \u201cThe Lord knows those who are his\u201d (2 Timothy 2:19). People who belong to God through faith in Jesus Christ are symbolically marked as belonging to God; it is as if they have a mark that says \u201cProperty of God.\u201d And if people are not in the family of God through faith in Jesus Christ, they belong to someone else (Matthew 12:30). It is as if there is a symbolic, figurative marking to denote that ownership.\nThe imposition of ashes on Ash Wednesday is a matter of Christian freedom. Christians are free to utilize the practice or not take part in it. This brief article will explain the meaning of that practice."}
{"prompt": "Commitment ceremony", "completion": "My sister (a widow) is living with a widower.  Rather than marry, they have chosen to have a commitment ceremony.  They say that it is better for them financially to not marry.  They attend a church of a different denomination and apparently that pastor finds the commitment ceremony to be an acceptable option.  Isn\u2019t the Bible clear that the only thing acceptable is marriage?  Has WELS said anything specific on this topic?\n\n\nThe essential part of marriage is the commitment of a man to a woman (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4-6). If marriage were simply a private commitment between two people, then a commitment ceremony could celebrate their actions, but marriage is also a contract between a man and a woman. It is a contract in the sense that governments regulate the commitment between a man and a woman through marriage licenses. Two people who have participated in a commitment ceremony and are living together without being legally married are fooling themselves but not God.\nWhen two people of the opposite sex\u2014regardless of age\u2014live together without the benefit of marriage, they are in a position of causing offense to others (Matthew 18:6-7) and emboldening others to follow their example. In addition, their lives are not in line with what God says: that \u201camong you, there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality\u201d (Ephesians 5:3). Christians who have long been on the receiving end of God\u2019s goodness are especially responsible for setting good examples for others (Luke 12:48).\nIt is sad when people prioritize financial concerns over doing what God says in his word. It is also sad when people do not give God opportunities to carry out his promises in their lives. After all, Jesus promised: \u201cBut seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well\u201d (Matthew 6:33). \u201cThese things\u201d that Jesus promised are the necessities of life: food and clothing (Matthew 6:31). God operates with his own mathematical and economic system as his children live their lives in trusting obedience of his will.\nContinue to help your sister with your prayers and your Christian witnessing."}
{"prompt": "Sibling's ceremony", "completion": "I have a sibling who is planning to get married to a same-sex partner. I have been invited to the ceremony. Out of concern for the truth and clear testimony to God's Word, should I even attend? What would be the best thing to do out of Christian love?\n\n\nWe learn from Romans 14:14, 23 how dangerous it is to act contrary to our conscience. So, if you are convinced that it would be wrong for you even to attend the ceremony, then it would be wrong for you. On the other hand, you might be convinced that you can, in good conscience, attend the ceremony without supporting same-sex marriage.\nIt goes without saying that your attendance or absence from the ceremony is not the most important matter here. More important is what you communicate to your sibling about your presence or absence.\nIf you choose to attend the ceremony, you can explain that you will do so because of your love for your sibling, not because you agree with your sibling\u2019s actions. If you choose not to attend, you can explain that you wrestled with how to show Christian love and also how to stand up for the truths of Scripture, and you settled on not attending the ceremony.\nOne thing to keep in mind is that if you choose not to attend the ceremony, there could be long-term complications in your relationship with your sibling; the opportunities for future Christian conversations with your sibling could be jeopardized. You will have to weigh your attendance at a ceremony with, potentially, many more years of contact with your sibling.\nChristians will arrive at different conclusions to questions like yours. Their conscientious considerations account for the differences. God bless you in your decision."}

{"prompt": "Concern for mother", "completion": "My mother is an alcoholic. She has always been emotionally unstable but now her physical health is failing her.  We don\u2019t have much to do with each other. She feels like we have a meaningful relationship but I don\u2019t feel the same way. I feel hurt by what she has done to our family. I have recently asked her to abstain from drinking around myself, my husband and my children. I explained to her that I love her but I don\u2019t want to witness her do this to herself anymore. She was upset with this so we haven\u2019t spoken in months. I am afraid she will die not knowing how much I love her. I want to be in her life and I want her in mine.  I pray frequently about this issue. \r\nShould I just back off and leave it alone or should I be more persistent in trying explain my feelings about the situation to her?  \n\n\nThere are important pieces of information I am lacking as I try to respond to your question. I do not know if your mother has sought and is receiving help for her alcohol abuse and failing health. I do not know if your mother is under the spiritual care of a pastor who knows of her condition. If your mother is not receiving physical or spiritual care, do what you can to encourage her to receive the help she needs.\nIf your mother\u2019s health is failing, your time to speak to her may be limited. She knows of your love and concern from past conversations but reminding her of your ongoing love and concern is important. By all means, tell your mother of your love for her. Reassure her that your love for her leads you to speak openly and frankly with her. Continue to speak the truth in love to her (Ephesians 4:15).\nOf utmost importance is your mother\u2019s soul; her relationship with God is vitally important. That is why a pastor\u2019s ministry to her at this time is significant. Don\u2019t overlook the resources your own pastor may have to help you and your family.\nKeep praying for your mother. We know from the Bible that prayer is powerful (James 5:16). Prayer is powerful because the One who hears and answers our prayers is powerful.\nDo share scriptural truths with your mother. Remind her of God\u2019s love for her (John 3:16). Recall for her the importance of confession and absolution (1 John 1:9 \u2013 2 John 2:2). Point her to God as her refuge and strength (Psalm 46:1).\nGod bless you and your family!"}
{"prompt": "The Holy Spirit and faith", "completion": "How does one receive the Holy Spirit?  If Christian faith is God's gift to people, why do we have so many people without the gift?  Thank you.\n\n\nThe Holy Spirit comes to people through the gospel in word alone or the word of God attached to earthly elements in the sacraments (Romans 10:17; 2 Thessalonians 2:13-14). So, we received the Holy Spirit when he worked in our hearts when we were baptized. The Holy Spirit continues to work in our hearts when we come into contact with the Bible and when we receive Holy Communion.\nChristian faith is a gift from God (Ephesians 2:8). People do not produce Christian faith on their own. Christian faith is a gift from God the Holy Spirit.\nGod certainly desires the salvation of all people (1 Timothy 2:4; 2 Peter 3:9). Through the efforts of Christians, God brings his gospel into the lives of people so that the Holy Spirit can change their hearts. What we have to recognize is that people are by nature spiritually dead (Ephesians 2:1), spiritually blind (Acts 26:17-18) and enemies of God (Romans 8:6-7). People naturally reject the good gifts God wants them to enjoy through Jesus his Son (Hosea 13:9; Matthew 23:37). When people believe the gospel of Jesus Christ, it is only because of the Holy Spirit\u2019s working in their hearts (2 Timothy 1:9; Titus 3:5-6).\nThat means that we want to continue spreading God\u2019s word to more and more people, so that the Holy Spirit can work through it to change hearts and fill them with Christian faith. You and I cannot control what happens after we share God\u2019s word with someone; we can\u2019t change anyone\u2019s heart. We can simply share the word of God with others. The results are out of our hands."}
{"prompt": "Jesus and the Last Day", "completion": "A friend told me Jesus will come back three times. I know Jesus will only come back on judgement day only one time. Where in the Bible can I find the verses that say Jesus will return?\n\n\nIt sounds like your friend is reflecting views that are associated with the false teaching of premillennial dispensationalism. By misunderstanding and misinterpreting different parts of Scripture, some people wrongly look for Jesus to return to this world secretly to resurrect or rapture Christians, to return another time to bind Satan and begin the millennium, and to rule visibly over an earthly kingdom for a 1,000-year period.\nScripture speaks of a single return of the Lord to this world (Matthew 24:36, 42; 25:13; Acts 2:20; 1 Corinthians 1:8; 5:5; 1 Thessalonians 5:2; 2 Thessalonians 2:2; 2 Peter 3:10). That return will be visible not secret (Acts 1:11)."}
{"prompt": "Obeying God", "completion": "If the government tells us we cannot meet in God's House (church) because of social distancing or any other reason, must we not follow God rather than man?  I have searched the website and see nothing about the current situation.  \n\n\nWithin a few hours of submitting your question, the WELS Conference of Presidents released the following question and answer.\nHow will congregations handle government restrictions on public gatherings?\nVarious governmental bodies have either advised or mandated that no public meetings with more than 50 people be held. Additional restrictions may be imposed in the future. Some may be asking the question, \u201cIs this a time when we should obey God rather than men?\u201d\nA couple things should be remembered.\n1. The Fourth and Fifth Commandments apply in a situation like this. We are to obey and respect the governing authorities as they carry out their God-given responsibilities, and we are to do all we can to protect our neighbors and keep them from harm.\n2. At the same time God certainly desires that Christian gather together regularly for worship.\n3. In limiting the size of worship gatherings, the government is not attempting to deny our freedom of religion. Rather, government authorities have issued mandates that they believe will protect citizens from harm.\n4. Since all of these biblical principles are valid, it is legitimate for our congregations to strive to comply with governmental regulations on the one hand and, on the other, to find alternate means to enable God\u2019s people to be fed with Word and sacrament.\n5. Recognize that this is an extraordinary opportunity to let our light shine as congregations and their members look for ways to serve the people in their communities in Christian love."}
{"prompt": "Hypnotism", "completion": "What does the Bible have to say about hypnotism?\n\n\nThe Bible does not specifically address hypnotism. Its applications range from entertainment to treatment of addictions. Because the Bible does not address hypnotism, Christians will want to apply other biblical principles to the subject. Those principles can include being personally responsible for our actions (Ezekiel 18:20), being in control of our actions (2 Timothy 3:3; 2 Peter 1:6), seeking help from the Lord (Psalm 50:15; 121:1-2) and subjecting our thoughts to Jesus Christ and his gospel (2 Corinthians 10:5)."}
{"prompt": "Participating in worship", "completion": "For those of us who are not tech savvy, how are we supposed to participate in worship? Many older people do not know how to access live streaming.  \n\n\nThis is a question that you really want to address to your pastor, and your pastor needs to be aware of a question like this.\nIn these extraordinary days, congregations are working to develop ways of ministering to their members apart from corporate worship services and face-to-face Bible classes. While there are many resources available, some of them\u2014as you indicated\u2014may involve technology that is challenging for some people. That is why you want to make your pastor aware of your situation, so that other resources can be developed and offered.\nWhile it is not a substitute for worshiping with fellow Christians, this resource can provide ideas for supplementing your devotional life. This resource has additional suggestions.\n\u201cI rejoiced with those who said to me, \u2018Let us go to the house of the Lord\u2019\u201d (Psalm 122:1). This temporary absence from the Lord\u2019s house helps us realize what a blessing we have long enjoyed in being able to assemble in his house for worship. God speed the day when we can meet each other there again!"}
{"prompt": "Venue of wedding", "completion": "What does God's word say about getting married at another location that is not inside the church?\n\n\nThe Bible does not provide instructions or directives on the location where a marriage is legally established. This is yet another area in life where there is Christian freedom.\nCertainly, a God-pleasing course of action that many Christians choose is having a marriage service take place in church. The house of the Lord is where God\u2019s people gather regularly to hear his word and offer him their prayers and praises. The house of the Lord is a fitting place where marriage, one of God\u2019s gifts, can be \u201cconsecrated by the word of God and prayer\u201d (1 Timothy 4:5).\nUltimately, the venue of a wedding is not the most important matter. What is all-important is understanding what the Bible says about marriage. It is the lifelong union between a man and a woman (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4-6)."}
{"prompt": "God and sickness", "completion": "What does the Bible say about disease? Did God create the coronavirus or does he allow it to happen for His own purposes? \n\n\nAt the end of the sixth day of creation, God pronounced everything he had made as being \u201cvery good\u201d (Genesis 1:31). The entrance of sin into the world brought sickness and death and untold problems into life (Genesis 3). The Bible makes it clear that God is not responsible for the existence of sin and its effects (Psalm 5:4; James 1:13-15). God is the giver of every good and perfect gift (James 1:17).\nWhen it comes to bad things in life, God can keep them out of Christians\u2019 lives (Psalm 91:9-10) or he can allow them to enter our lives for good purposes (Romans 8:28). In the latter case, you and I sometimes might have difficulty understanding the good purposes that God has in mind. That is because God\u2019s ways and thoughts are\u2014thankfully\u2014different from ours (Isaiah 55:8-9).\nThe confidence we can have at a time like this is that God is very much in control of his world (Psalm 46; 104; Colossians 1:17; Hebrews 1:3). While we know that God will use every circumstance in life for our eventual and eternal good, we also look forward to a life that is free from sin and its effects (Revelation 7:15-17; 21:4). Little wonder that the Church thinks of Jesus\u2019 visible return on the Last Day and prays, \u201cAmen. Come, Lord Jesus\u201d (Revelation 22:20)."}
{"prompt": "How Lutherans view Mary", "completion": "How do Lutherans view the Virgin Mary compared to Catholics? Do they still honor her and love her?\n\n\nWe view Mary as the woman God graciously chose to give birth to Jesus Christ. Mary received that honor and privilege only because of God\u2019s grace to her (Luke 1:26-38).\nRoman Catholic Church teaching is that Mary entered this world as a baby without a sinful nature. The Bible does not teach that. The Bible teaches that all people born from a human father and a human mother are conceived and born in sin (John 3:6). Like all such people, Mary was in need of a Savior to forgive her sins. She recognized her sinfulness and need for a Savior (Luke 1:47). Roman Catholic Church teaching is that Mary did not commit actual sins. The Bible teaches that all people born from a human father and a human mother are guilty of sin (Psalm 14:2-3; Romans 3:23).\nRoman Catholic Church teaching is that Mary remained a virgin after she gave birth to Jesus by not having sexual relations with Joseph. The Bible does not teach that. Roman Catholic Church teaching is that Mary\u2019s body and soul went to heaven at the end of her earthly life. The Bible does not teach that. Roman Catholic Church teaching is that Mary is in a position to receive and answer prayers that are directed to her. The Bible teaches that any acts of worship, including prayer, are to be directed to God alone (Matthew 4:10; Revelation 22:9). Roman Catholic Church teaching speaks of a \u201csaving office\u201d of Mary. The Bible does not teach that. There is only one Savior and mediator between God and people: Jesus Christ (1 Timothy 2:5-6).\nWhen we hold to what the Bible teaches, we will understand that Mary was a person who received a great blessing from God in being the woman to give birth to the promised Savior. From the Bible, we will see that the Savior, Jesus Christ, came to save people from their sins, including Mary."}
{"prompt": "Catechism review of Holy Communion", "completion": "During this COVID-19 period of isolation/shelter-in-place, could you please take us back to our Catechism instruction days and refresh us on (1) why for good order we ask our pastors to distribute Holy Communion as well as (2) who may do so in good conscience, especially in special circumstances like quarantine. I think it would be a timely topic for those craving the blessings of Lord's Supper while our churches cannot physically meet.  Thank you.\n\n\nThis brief Catechism review will use the edition of Luther\u2019s Catechism produced by Northwestern Publishing House in 2017.\n\u201cWhy do Christians gather together in congregations? Hebrews 10:24-25; Acts 2:42; 2 Peter 3:18.\u201d\n\u201cHow does God guide Christian congregations as they use the keys publicly? Matthew 18:20; Ephesians 4:11-12; Titus 1:5; Acts 14:23; 1 Timothy 5:17; Matthew 16:19. God provides Christian congregations with leaders who are to faithfully guide the affairs of the congregation. Preaching and teaching God\u2019s Word is one of the most important ways that they lead their congregations.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are some ways in which a pastor serves the congregation that has called him? 1 Corinthians 4:1; 1 Timothy 4:13; 2 Timothy 4:2-3; Mark 16:15; Luke 24:47; 2 Timothy 4:5; Isaiah 52:7; James 5:14; 2 Corinthians 1:3-4. The pastor serves the congregation by leading the members in public worship, preaching and teaching God\u2019s law and gospel, and counseling and encouraging the members with God\u2019s Word. 1 Corinthians 14:40; Matthew 28:19; 1 Corinthians 11:24-25. The pastor serves the congregation by administering the sacraments in an orderly way. Ephesians 4:11-12. The pastor serves the members of the congregation by training them with the Word of God, equipping them to serve their Savior.\u201d\nThe Pastor Call Form used in our synod highlights these truths, as it charges pastors: \u201cTo preach the gospel of our Lord among us in its truth and purity, to administer the sacraments in accordance with the inspired Word of God and the Confessions of the Evangelical Lutheran Church as incorporated in the Book of Concord of 1580, and to establish and maintain sound Lutheran practice at all times.\u201d\nConcerning special situations like quarantine, the latest Together newsletter provided this information: \u201cSince restrictions on gatherings vary from place to place, the celebration of the Lord\u2019s Supper will in some places need to be modified, depending on government restrictions and medical guidelines. Some congregations, if allowed by state and local authorities, are gathering in small groups and taking great care to practice good hygiene and recommended \u2018social distancing.\u2019\n\u201cIn other places, even small gatherings are not allowed. There have been questions about how we should proceed when it comes to the celebration of the Lord\u2019s Supper when members cannot gather at church.\n\u201cRegardless of the specific situation in which your congregation finds itself, here are a couple of things to remember. First, while Christians desire to be strengthened and comforted by the Lord\u2019s Supper, we also recognize that there are times when the normal celebration of Communion is not possible. For Christians serving in a war zone, for church members who are in a medically induced coma, for believers who are home-bound because of sickness or infirmity, the normal celebration of the Lord\u2019s Supper with other believers may not be an option. But in those cases we take comfort in knowing that we have the means of grace in two forms\u2014Word and sacrament. The forgiveness conveyed and assured by the written or spoken Word of God is no less powerful and effective than the sacrament. In some cases, private Communion may certainly be available.\n\u201cSecond, we also recognize that there is no scriptural definition or requirement for how frequently Christians should celebrate the Lord\u2019s Supper. Jesus simply encourages us to receive the Lord\u2019s Supper regularly and often. There may be times such as this that, temporarily, the Lord\u2019s Supper may not be available as often as we would like or desire. For that reason, the Conference of Presidents is urging patience with the following advice:\n\u201c\u2019We encourage our congregations at this time to reserve the distribution of the Lord\u2019s Supper for its regular and normal use within the gathering of the body of believers (realizing that some changes in procedure may be made) or distributed privately by the pastor to individuals in need, as is the customary practice.

{"prompt": "Old Testament prophecy fulfilled in Jesus", "completion": "Have you heard of a guy named Tovia Singer? He is a Jew that is totally against Jesus. He is well versed in the Bible and says worshiping Jesus is idolatry. He has really made me question Jesus as God's Son and his knowledge of the original Hebrew text and how the so-called prophecies about Jesus in the Old Testament are not talking about Jesus at all, like the Isaiah prophecy was talking about Hezekiah. Is Jesus idol worship? Was he made up by the Greeks? This is destroying my Christian faith.\n\n\nThere are many voices out there calling for your attention. I encourage you to listen to the voice of your Good Shepherd (John 10:3, 4, 27). That Shepherd, Jesus Christ, speaks to you through the Bible, which is true in every way (John 17:17).\nScripture tells us to beware of people who deny that Jesus Christ is the Son of God (1 John 2:22; 4:3; 2 John 7). Anyone who denies the deity of Jesus Christ does not speak the truth.\nThe Old Testament repeatedly pointed ahead to Jesus Christ as the promised Messiah (John 5:39). Consider the following:\n\u201cAccording to David Jesus is both the Lord God (Psalm 110:1; Matthew 22:44) and true man (Psalm 8:4-6; Hebrews 2:6-8), yet he was without sin according to Isaiah (53:9; 1 Peter 2:22). The ministry of Jesus would be in Galilee as Isaiah had said (9:1,2; Matthew 4:15-16). Yet the Savior would appear in Jerusalem according to Zechariah (13:7; Matthew 26:31). Jesus came to instruct humanity in the ways of God (Psalm 78:2; Matthew 13:35), to bear the infirmities and diseases of people (Isaiah 53:4; Matthew 8:17), and to heal their wounds as Isaiah predicted (53:5; 1 Peter 2:24). According to Zechariah his disciples would desert him (13:7; Matthew 26:31) and leave him to be pierced by his foes (12:10; John 19:37). He would hang, accursed, on a tree (Deuteronomy 21:23; Galatians 3 13). Even so, no bones of his body would be broken (Psalm 34:20; John 19:36), nor would his body rot in the grave (Psalm 16:10; Acts 2:31). Rather he would sit at God\u2019s right hand in glory (Psalm 110:1; Acts 2:34).\u201d\nIf you would like to read more about Old Testament prophecy and New Testament fulfillment in Jesus Christ, you can read a brief paper from which the paragraph above was taken.\nI pray for God\u2019s blessings on your study of his word."}
{"prompt": "Judgment at death", "completion": "Where do our souls go at the time of death?\r\n\n\n\nWhen death takes place, judgment also takes place (Hebrews 9:27). At death, the souls of Christians enter God\u2019s presence in heaven, while the souls of unbelievers go to hell. The account of the rich man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31) is a section of Scripture that teaches these truths."}
{"prompt": "Sign of the cross", "completion": "Why don\u2019t Lutherans make the sign of the cross like Catholics do? I know Lutheran pastors start services by making the sign of the cross but why doesn\u2019t the congregation do it?\n\n\nSome Lutherans do make the sign of the cross; many do not. It is entirely a matter of Christian freedom.\nYou might be interested to know that in his Small Catechism (in the Concordia Triglotta) Martin Luther included this preface to his Morning Prayer: \u201cIn the morning, when you rise, you shall bless yourself with the holy cross and say: In the name of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen. Then, kneeling or standing, repeat the Creed and the Lord\u2019s Prayer. If you choose, you may, in addition, say this little prayer\u201d [which we know as Luther\u2019s Morning Prayer].\nSimilar wording precedes his Evening Prayer: \u201cIn the evening, when you go to bed, you shall bless yourself with the holy cross and say: In the name of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen. Then, kneeling or standing, repeat the Creed and the Lord\u2019s Prayer. If you choose, you may, in addition, say this little prayer\u201d [which we know as Luther\u2019s Evening Prayer].\nIn addition, The Lutheran Hymnal (1941) included this rubric for worshipers: \u201cThe sign of the cross may be made at the Trinitarian Invocation and at the words of the Nicene Creed \u2018and the life of the world to come.\u2019\u201d\nLutherans are free to follow or disregard those instructions for making the sign of the cross. There are no ceremonial laws for New Testament children of God.\nAnecdotally, I can tell you that some Lutherans make the sign of the cross when they receive the Lord\u2019s Supper. Lutherans who do that are exercising their Christian freedom. Lutherans who do not join in that practice are also exercising their Christian freedom.\nMaking the sign of the cross can be a helpful reminder that Christians are redeemed children of God\u2014people who enjoy salvation only because of God\u2019s forgiving love and not because of anything they have done (Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:5-7). Wearing a cross can serve that same purpose. With untold words and various actions, Christians seek to point others to Jesus and his cross (Galatians 6:14)."}
{"prompt": "Help with prayer", "completion": "What does God say about prayer and when and how often we need to do it ? I do pray to the Lord for dinner, problems , bad days or frustration, church, etc., but it seems like that's the only time I go to the Lord.  I would like to know if what I am doing is the correct thing, and not that I only go to God when times are not good.  Can you provide any passages for my concern?  Thanks.\n\n\nRather than seeing prayer as an obligation, the Bible teaches that prayer is a privilege Christians enjoy. God promises to hear and answer the prayers of his children (Psalm 34:15, 17; Matthew 7:7).\nGod certainly instructs us to come to him in prayer in times of trouble (Psalm 50:15), but those are not the only times to pray or the only kinds of prayers to offer. The Bible teaches us to speak to God with \u201cpetitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving (1 Timothy 2:1); it directs us to \u201cpray continually\u201d (1 Thessalonians 5:17).\nPrayer completes two-way conversation with God. Through his word, the Bible, God speaks to us (Hebrews 1:1-2). With prayer, we have the privilege of speaking to God.\nSo, I encourage you to look upon prayer as conversation with God. Think of how conversation with family and friends often goes: it takes place numerous times throughout the day and night. Similarly, you can look upon prayer as a running conversation with God throughout the day and night. The sight of life\u2019s beauties can move you to breathe a brief \u201cThank you, Lord.\u201d prayer. Observing people struggling in life can lead you to a short \u201cBless them. Lord.\u201d prayer.\nThe conversations we have with God throughout the day can be long and short. They can take place as we walk and drive, eat and rest. They do not need to fit a certain structure.\nLike anything else in the Christian life, there is room for improvement in our prayer life. When we have neglected prayer or used prayer selfishly, we use prayer to confess our sins: \u201cHave mercy on us, Lord.\u201d In response to a prayer like that, God responds: \u201cI have swept away your offenses like a cloud, your sins like the morning mist\u201d (Isaiah 44:22). That is two-way conversation between a Christian and God in action. God\u2019s blessings on your prayer life."}
{"prompt": "Forgiveness for sin", "completion": "Can I be forgiven for sins when i said the G--D D-M  IT?  I did not mean it.  The words just kinda slipped out of my mouth. I read the Bible or books like Billy Graham etc. and pray every day that God will forgive me. I hope that Jesus will let me into heaven when my time comes.\n\n\nThe Bible teaches that Jesus Christ won forgiveness for all sins by his holy life and sacrificial death (1 John 2:2). Jesus\u2019 glorious resurrection from the dead is proof positive that God the Father accepted Jesus\u2019 work as the full payment for sin (Romans 4:25).\nThrough Spirit-worked faith in Jesus Christ, people personally enjoy the forgiveness of sins Jesus has won (Romans 5:1). The Bible teaches us to confess our sinful thoughts and words and actions to God, and to receive his message of forgiveness in faith (1 John 1:9; 2:1-2).\nOur thankful response for God\u2019s gracious forgiveness of our sins is to lead lives that are pleasing to him. When we fail to do that, as in using words you did, we bring those sins to the Lord, as Jesus taught us to do in the Lord\u2019s Prayer: \u201cforgive us our sins\u201d (Luke 11:4). Our comfort is knowing and believing that Jesus was perfect in our place (Hebrews 4:15); he never uttered wrong words. In addition, God laid all our sins, including our sins of misusing his name, on his Son, Jesus (Isaiah 53:4-9).\nWhen it comes to the end of our earthly lives, God has given us some wonderful promises. You can look up passages like these: Mark 16:16; John 3:16; 10:27-30; 11:25.\nKeep the Bible at the top of your reading list. Recognize that salvation is God\u2019s doing, from beginning to end. Keep in mind that Christian faith is a gift of God (John 15:16; Ephesians 2:8). Keep your focus on Jesus (Psalm 141:8; Hebrews 12:1-2). God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Scripture readings and standing", "completion": "Would you please explain how the readings are chosen for service?  Why are some readings from the Old and others the New Testament?  How come we only stand for the \"gospel\"?  Shouldn't we stand for all the readings because it is the \"word of the Lord\"?  Thank you for your response!!!\n\n\nProbably most of our churches use the schedule of Scripture readings that you will find on pages 163-166 of Christian Worship: A Lutheran Hymnal. Pages 163-165 list the Scripture readings over a three-year cycle. We are currently in \u201cYear A\u201d (page 163). Page 166 lists an annually-repeated schedule of Scripture readings.\nChristian Worship: Manual, the \u201chandbook\u201d for our hymnal, provides an explanation for worshipers standing for the reading of the gospel: \u201cThe congregation stands for the reading of the Gospel. In the past soldiers put down their weapons and kings removed their crowns when the Gospel was read. Christ\u2014his life, his words of law and gospel, his suffering, his death, his resurrection, his ascension, his assignment to his Church, his promise to return\u2014is the center of the Gospel. The faithful have waited for this moment, this reading. They stand in reverence. \u201d (pages 173-174)\nThrough the gospel lesson Jesus\u2014the Word (John 1), the Word of God (Revelation 19:13)\u2014comes to us. The gospel lesson relays the words and works of Christ. For those reasons, we have retained an ancient practice of showing respect and awe for the Lord and his gospel by standing. That practice of course falls into the category of adiaphora: those things that God has neither commanded nor forbidden. In Christian freedom, we gladly include that posture in our liturgy\u2014as we are able."}
{"prompt": "Consecrating the elements", "completion": "Before Communion, the pastor says a blessing followed by the sign of the cross, over the elements, before distributing them.  What\u2019s the reason for the blessing.  He cannot change them to blood and body. During these days, some churches are having service in their parking lot, using short range radio. You bring your drink of choice, bread or cracker, he blesses them and you receive Communion. Is this acceptable?\n\n\nWhat you are describing is the pastor speaking \u201cthe words of institution\u201d in the consecration of the elements. The Shepherd Under Christ, a pastoral theology textbook used at our seminary for many years, provides this explanation for the consecration of the elements.\n\u201cEssentially the consecration consists in speaking the words of institution over the visible elements. Its purpose is, first of all, to show that it is the pastor\u2019s intention to carry out Jesus\u2019 institution and to set the visible elements apart for use in the sacrament. It furthermore serves as a prayer that the Lord may do what He has promised, as a confession that the body and blood of Christ are present in the sacrament, and as an invitation to the communicants to appropriate Jesus\u2019 promise by faith.\n\u201cSuch a use of the words of institution in consecrating the visible elements is an ancient custom (1 Cor 10:10), but the words are not to be considered a magic formula that effects a change in the elements. The presence of the body and blood does not depend on the simple repeating of the words but comes about through the gracious working of the Lord, whose promise is connected with the words. The real presence is therefore also not dependent on the faith of the man who speaks the words.\u201d (Page 91)\nConcerning the practice you mentioned, our Conference of Presidents recently gave this advice: \u201cWe encourage our congregations at this time to reserve the distribution of the Lord\u2019s Supper for its regular and normal use within the gathering of the body of believers (realizing that some changes in procedure may be made) or distributed privately by the pastor to individuals in need, as is the customary practice. We urge congregations to refrain from initiating novel approaches for celebration of the sacrament.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "God's omnipresence", "completion": "While Jesus was physically present on earth, was he at the same time omnipotently present outside of time? \n\n\nI am understanding your question to address Jesus\u2019 state of humiliation\u2014that time in the Lord\u2019s earthly life when he laid aside the full and constant use of his qualities as God (Philippians 2:6-8).\nAt all times, the Lord\u2019s omnipresence is a reality. Sections of the Bible like Psalm 139:7-8 and Acts 17:27-28 provide that information.\u00a0 This is certainly true regarding Jesus\u2019 state of exaltation (Philippians 2:9-11)."}
{"prompt": "Online worship and devotions", "completion": "In this time of online worship and devotions, is it now OK for women to be leading by reading the Scriptures in online devotions?\n\n\nIn their personal lives, God\u2019s will is that Christians, men and women, \u201clet their light shine\u201d (Matthew 5:16), declare his praises (Psalm 96:3; 1 Peter 2:9) and share his word with others (Matthew 10:32; 28:19-20).\nWhen it comes to public, representative ministry, God lays out instructions for men and women in their service to him and others (1 Corinthians 11:3; 14:33-35; 1 Timothy 2:11-12).\nChristian congregations and individual Christians are certainly using these unusual times of lockdowns and quarantines to let their light shine and sow the seed of God\u2019s word (Matthew 13). This spiritual activity can be one of the ways in which God is working good (Romans 8:28) through our present troubled conditions."}
{"prompt": "Seeing God", "completion": "We often say when we go to heaven we will see God. Would I be correct in saying that the only form we will see of God is the risen Son, Jesus? Are the Father and Holy Spirit only spiritual? If this is the case, is there any mention of how the angels worship God? Were they able to see him in heaven before he appeared in his risen body? Hope this makes some sense. Thank you!\n\n\nIt is correct to say that we will see God when we stand in his presence in heaven. The Bible teaches that (Job 19:25-37; Psalm 17:15; Matthew 5:8; 1 Corinthians 13:12; 1 John 3:2).\nYes, the Father and the Holy Spirit do not have physical bodies. That was the case for Jesus until he took on human flesh at his conception and birth (Galatians 4:4; Hebrews 2:14).\nWhile angels are spirit beings with no physical bodies (Hebrews 1:14), the Bible tells us that, at times, they did appear to people in a way they could be seen (for example, Matthew 28:1-3). Angels even appeared in the likeness of human beings (Genesis 18).\nFor a description of the praise angels give God, read sections of the Bible like Isaiah 6:1-3; Luke 2:13; and, Revelation 5:11-12).\nConsidering who God is, what he is like and what he has done, there is little wonder why Scripture instructs angels \u2013 and people and all creation\u2014to praise God (Psalm 148)."}
{"prompt": "Lutherans and Scripture alone", "completion": "Why do Lutherans believe in Scripture alone when nowhere in the Bible it says that you should do that? Why not also believe in tradition like Catholics do?\n\n\nWe believe that Scripture alone is the source of our faith because that is what Scripture teaches. In the Bible God makes it clear that we are not to add to or subtract from his word (Deuteronomy 4:2; Revelation 22:18-19). The apostle Paul states clearly that God\u2019s word is the foundation of the Christian Church and Jesus Christ is the chief cornerstone (Ephesians 2:20). There are no other foundations, like tradition, for our faith. Jesus tells us to search the Scriptures (John 5:39) and not to look anywhere else for saving truth (Luke 16:29). Jesus rebuked people who added to the word of God (Matthew 15:7-9).\nFinally, Scripture alone is inspired and inerrant (1 Corinthians 2:13; 2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:21). Unlike the words and writings of people, God\u2019s word can always be trusted because he always speaks the truth (Numbers 23:19)."}
{"prompt": "Jesus' promise and prayer", "completion": "What does Jesus mean when he says in Matthew 7:7, \u201c\u2026knock, and the door will be opened to you.\u201d\n\n\nJesus means to say that he promises to hear and answer prayers. Any and all prayers? No, only those prayers that are addressed to the Triune God.\nThe answer may not be what we desire or communicate to God, but the answer will be the best for us at the time."}
{"prompt": "Administering Baptism and the Lord's Supper", "completion": "In the Sacrament of Baptism, anyone can baptize, using water and the Word?\r\nCan anyone also administer the Sacrament of Holy Communion, or where is it found that only certain trained persons (i.e., pastors, church councilmen) can administer this Sacrament? \r\nI am asking because my church has chosen to abstain from administering Holy Communion at this time.\n\n\nWith a concern for orderliness (1 Corinthians 14:40), congregations call pastors to administer the sacraments, among many other responsibilities and privileges. You are correct in noting that, in times of emergency, any Christian can baptize. That would especially be true with the case of a child or infant.\nThere really are not parallel emergency situations with the distribution of the Lord\u2019s Supper. Certainly, Christians may desire the Lord\u2019s Supper in times of sickness and when earthly life is coming to an end, but if that is not possible, the word of God alone brings the same blessings as the Lord\u2019s Supper. We speak of the gospel in word and sacrament. Recognizing the power of God\u2019s word, there is no need to deviate from our regular practice of having our pastors administer the sacrament.\nI would direct your attention to a recent question and answer concerning the church\u2019s administration of the Lord\u2019s Supper and a recent Together newsletter that addressed congregational worship life in these unsettled days."}
{"prompt": "Receiving the Lord's Supper", "completion": "As a confirmed LCMS member, can I take Communion at a WELS church?   Thank you.\n\n\nOur pastors are happy to commune people who belong to churches of our fellowship. An LCMS (The Lutheran Church\u2014Missouri Synod) member represents his or her church, and because WELS and LCMS are not in fellowship with one another, we refrain from communing together, as the reception of the Lord\u2019s Supper is an expression of unity in the faith (1 Corinthians 10:17). The individual profession of a person is one thing, but a person\u2019s profession of faith by his or her church membership is what we really need to consider. We see church membership as a way in which Christians acknowledge Jesus before others (Matthew 10:32) and publicly indicate their unity in faith and doctrine with fellow believers.\nOur practice in WELS is not unique. LCMS states on its website: \u201cThe official position of the Synod is that not only are members of other Lutheran churches with whom we are in altar and pulpit fellowship invited to commune with us, but also that in certain extraordinary cases of pastoral care and in emergencies members of churches not in fellowship with us may be given Communion.\u201d WELS also allows for extraordinary cases and emergencies, but we recognize LCMS\u2019 position of normally communing those \u201cwith whom we are in altar and pulpit fellowship.\u201d That would exclude WELS.\nIf you are visiting one of our churches, I invite you to contact the pastor(s) for more information."}
{"prompt": "Jesus on the cross", "completion": "Was Jesus naked on the cross because the Roman soldiers cast lots for the undergarment as described in John 19:23-24? Also, it is unusual that there is a distinction between clothes and undergarment.  However I do not know how to translate the original Greek that may have some insight on this section.\n\n\nYour first question is one that remains unanswered. History tells us that it was common practice for crucifixion victims to be naked. That was part of the shame and humiliation of the public execution. The Bible does not specifically mention the nakedness of the crucifixion victims on Calvary, but if that is what Jesus endured, it is another example of how he \u201chumbled himself by becoming obedient to death\u2014even death on a cross! (Philippians 2:8)\nThe Bible does tell us that the four soldiers assigned to oversee Jesus\u2019 crucifixion divided his clothing into four equal parts and cast lots for his \u201cundergarment\u201d (some Bible translations: \u201ctunic\u201d). The original Greek simply has different terms for clothing in that verse.\nThose seemingly insignificant details about Jesus\u2019 clothing point to fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy: \u201cThey divided my clothes among them and cast lots for my garment\u201d (Psalm 22:18). Jesus is the Christ, the anointed one, the Messiah."}
{"prompt": "The means of grace and forgiveness", "completion": "Professor Pope,\r\n\r\nThank you for the tireless work and enthusiasm you bring to WELS Q&A.  It is much appreciated. I have a question about forgiveness and the sacraments. My understanding of our WELS doctrine is that our Baptism forgives our sins for all time, even those committed after the Baptism. I trust in this doctrine, and believe it is well supported by Scripture. However, when I read First Corinthians, I notice that Holy Communion also forgives our sins. I trust that both these sacraments are a free gift received through faith in Christ, but I can't help but wonder as a result if Baptism truly forgives all future sins, given that God saw fit to institute the Lord's Supper as a separate means of forgiveness. Do these sacraments forgive separate \"kinds\" of sins, or do both sacraments equally forgive all sins, or is the question simply unanswered in Scripture? I read the Large Catechism on the subject, but was still left uncertain, as Luther seemed to focus more on the comfort and strength imparted by Holy Communion rather than on the details of forgiving sins. I trust in my Baptism, but the situation nags at me. Thank you for your time.\n\n\nThank you for your kind words!\nYour question focuses on the means of grace\u2014the means by which God offers and gives forgiveness of sins to sinners. That means is the gospel in word and sacraments.\nThrough Baptism\u2014water and the word of God\u2014or the word of God alone, God changes hearts and connects people in saving faith to Jesus Christ (Romans 1:16). As children of God through faith in Jesus Christ, Christians enjoy forgiveness of all sins (Romans 8:33-34; Ephesians 1:7; Colossians 2:13).\nHaving a sinful nature means that Christians still sin (Romans 7:15-25). In the Lord\u2019s Prayer, Jesus taught us to confess our sins to God (Luke 11:4). Scripture teaches us that such confession is not meaningless. No, \u201cIf we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness\u201d (1 John 1:9). God provides that forgiveness through his gospel in word and sacrament. Through the message of the Bible alone, through the Lord\u2019s Supper and through Baptism, God says, \u201cYour sins are forgiven.\u201d\nIs that a separate kind of forgiveness, you wonder? No. God\u2019s message of forgiveness is consistently the same: \u201cYour sins are forgiven because my Son lived perfectly in your place and on the cross suffered the punishment of your sins.\u201d God forgave all sins when he gave us spiritual life by connecting us to Jesus in faith, and God gives us that same message of forgiveness each time he comes to us through the gospel in word and sacraments. Through word and sacraments, God tells us repeatedly, \u201cI forgive you. You are mine.\u201d\nAs people who still have a sinful nature, as people who fail to do the good that God commands, and as people who fail to avoid the evil that God forbids, we need God\u2019s message and declaration of forgiveness. God gave that when he brought us to faith and he continues to give that when we use his gospel. God is not stingy with his forgiveness, nor does he give it out in installments. God\u2019s forgiveness is total\u2014full and free.\nI hope this helps your understanding."}
{"prompt": "\"Heavenly Banquet\"", "completion": "What does it mean that Holy Communion is a \"Heavenly Banquet\"?\n\n\nI am not entirely sure what source you are referencing with your words in quotation marks. We do have some hymns in the Holy Communion section of Christian Worship: A Lutheran Hymnal that use similar language: \u201cHeavn\u2019ly bread\u201d (309:2); \u201cO Living Bread from heaven\u201d (314:1); \u201cThis is the hour of banquet and of song; Here is the heav\u2019nly table spread anew\u201d (315:2); The last stanza of hymn 315 extends that imagery: \u201cFeast after feast thus comes and passes by, Yet, passing, points to that glad feast above; Giving sweet foretaste of the festal joy; The Lamb\u2019s great marriage feast of bliss and love.\u201d\nIn Holy Communion, the Son of God from heaven gives us his body and blood, in, with and under the bread and wine. That same Lord spoke of looking forward to a heavenly meal with his followers (Luke 16:15-18). The prophet Isaiah also described God\u2019s eternal love in the imagery of a great banquet (25:6-9).\nWe find all these thoughts in a prayer in Christian Worship: Supplement \u2013 \u201cWe give you thanks, O Lord, for the foretaste of the heavenly banquet that you have given us to eat and to drink in this sacrament. Through this gift you have fed our faith, nourished our hope, and strengthened our love. By your Spirit help us to live as your holy people until that day when you will receive us as your guests at the wedding supper of the Lamb, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.\u201d\nSo, perhaps, that prayer is what you were referencing. At any rate, I hope this helps your understanding."}
{"prompt": "Satan's power", "completion": "Hello.  I don't know very much about Christianity, but I had a question. Can Satan send people to earth to specifically ruin your life or tempt you to sin?\r\nThank you.\n\n\nThe Bible teaches us that Satan\u2019s power is greater than ours (Ephesians 6:12) but less than God\u2019s (Job 1:12; Hebrews 2:14; 1 John 3:8). What we want to keep in mind is that while Satan is an enemy of God and followers of God, Satan has allies to help him in his evil work.\nOne ally is the sinful world in which Christians live. Satan can use the allurement of earthly wealth (1 John 2:15-16) to try to lure Christians into abandoning their real spiritual wealth (Ephesians 1:7). Satan can also use people in this world to oppose God and godliness (Luke 22:3; Acts 5:3).\nAnother ally of Satan is the sinful nature that lives within each person (Romans 8:7; Galatians 5:17, 19-21).\nAll this information means that Satan or his evil angels can tempt Christians. Satan can work through other people to tempt Christians. Satan can work with the sinful natures of Christians to tempt them.\nThis is not a hopeless situation though. Not at all. In the place of all people, Jesus Christ withstood every temptation of Satan (Matthew 4:1-11; Hebrews 4:15). By his holy life, innocent death and glorious resurrection, Jesus has crushed the power of Satan (Hebrews 2:14). Satan has lost the battle. God gives Christians powerful weapons to defeat Satan in the daily skirmishes of life (Ephesians 6:10-17).\nI encourage you to look up the Bible verses that are included in this response. Since you also described yourself as someone who \u201cdoesn\u2019t know very much about Christianity,\u201d you would benefit from looking at another website from our church body \u2013 \u201cWhat About Jesus?\u201d There are many good resources there for you. God bless you and your study of his word."}
{"prompt": "Jesus, the Word of God", "completion": "What does it mean that Jesus is the Word of God?\n\n\n\u201cHe is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is the Word of God\u201d (Revelation 19:13). That is a description of Jesus.\nThe name that Jesus has in that verse from Revelation 19 is rare. In other inspired writings, the apostle John called Jesus \u201cthe Word\u201d (John 1; 1 John 1). Revelation 19:13 lengthens \u201cthe Word\u201d to \u201cthe Word of God.\u201d\nWhile John does not explain that name, other parts of Scripture can shed light on it. Revelation 19:15 describes Jesus with a \u201csharp sword\u201d in his mouth. Revelation 1:16 pictures Jesus with a \u201csharp, double-edged sword\u201d coming out of his mouth.\nThose images bring to mind the writer to the Hebrew\u2019s declaration that the word of God is \u201csharper than any double-edged sword\u201d (Hebrews 4:12). That same writer began his epistle with these words: \u201c In the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom also he made the universe\u201d (Hebrews 1:1-2). Finally, Jesus said this, \u201cThese words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me\u201d (John 14:24).\nAll this says that \u201cWord of God\u201d is a very fitting and appropriate name for Jesus because he came to this world as a human being to proclaim the word of God to people, and that word of God centers in him, the promised Savior."}
{"prompt": "The Alpha Program", "completion": "What is WELS' position on the Alpha Program?\n\n\nThere is no official synod position on that evangelism program. I can pass along only personal observations.\nThe program is ecumenical in nature. The Alpha website states: \u201cThe same Alpha content is run all over the world, by Christians of all traditions.\u201d Providing the same content is consistent with their stated philosophy: \u201cThe Alpha Course is created to emphasize the essentials that all denominations agree on. We believe that what unites us is infinitely greater than what divides us.\u201d\nThat generic approach to Christianity leads to concerns like these in some of the videos I watched: a view of humanity that did not include clear biblical statements about having a sinful nature when life begins, decision theology, and speaking in tongues as the way to be filled with the Holy Spirit.\nEngaging people in conversations about Jesus Christ and the Bible is important. Not being able to customize the content of the program would lead me to look elsewhere for evangelism resources."}
{"prompt": "Medical research", "completion": "What does the Bible have to say about gain-of-function viral-vector research for HIV vaccines?  Is it a moral activity that Christians should support, since it's meant to help other people?  Or is it an immoral activity that Christians should oppose, because (1) It's meant to enable homosexual and promiscuous life-styles; (2) 30 years of failed HIV research has caused immense suffering on macaque monkeys and other animals;  (3) Some of the failed HIV vaccine trials have actually caused HIV infections in previously healthy humans?\n\n\nThe Bible does not specifically address the research you mention in your question. That means that we need to look to the Bible for other information that can be applicable. God\u2019s law and God\u2019s gospel are always good starting points for examining life\u2019s issues.\nThe message of God\u2019s law is that God demands perfection (Matthew 5:48) and threatens punishment for anything less than perfection (Ezekiel 18:20). God\u2019s law condemns all people as sinners (Romans 3:23).\nThe message of God\u2019s gospel is that God loves sinners (John 3:16) and has provided forgiveness for all sins through Jesus Christ his Son (2 Corinthians 5:19; 1 John 2:2).\nWhen the Holy Spirit changes hearts and lives and connects people to Jesus Christ in saving faith, then Christians desire to distance themselves from sin and live life God\u2019s way (2 Corinthians 5:15).\nChristians seek to say \u201cno\u201d to sin and \u201cyes\u201d to godly living (Titus 2:12). Christians also seek to be \u201csalt\u201d and \u201clight\u201d in their daily lives to encourage others to glorify God by their lives (Matthew 5:13-16).\nSo, when it comes to vaccines like those you mentioned, Christians will recognize the \u201csin enabling\u201d problem associated with them. Then, again, Christians can understand that the preservation of people\u2019s time of grace can furnish necessary opportunities to repent of sin and to look to Jesus Christ in faith as their Savior from sin. As God does not desire the death of sinners (Ezekiel 19:23), neither do Christians.\nMedical research that causes \u201cimmense suffering\u201d in animals does raise serious and legitimate questions. Motive becomes paramount in trying to arrive at satisfactory conclusions.\nYour questions lead us to look ahead to that time when \u201cHe will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the older order of things has passed away\u201d (Revelation 21:4)."}
{"prompt": "New testament canon", "completion": "This is really bothering me. Why do we consider the papacy of the Roman Catholic Church the Antichrist when they chose the books for the New Testament we use? Seems like everything about the Bible is pick and choose by man. Thanks.\n\n\nThis link will take you to a \u201cStatement on the Antichrist\u201d located elsewhere on this website.\nThe Statement explains that the Lutheran Confessions have identified the papacy as the Antichrist for reasons of \u201cusurping authority in the Church and tyrannizing Christian consciences,\u201d and opposing God by \u201cusurping the place and name of God\u201d (2 Thessalonians 2:4).\nThe papacy did not choose the books for the New Testament we use. The apostles were involved in the collection and preservation of the books of the New Testament (2 Peter 3:15-16; 1 Thessalonians 5:19-22, 2 Thessalonians 2:2, Revelation 2:2). God established what we call the \u201ccanon.\u201d In time, God\u2019s followers recognized the canon."}
{"prompt": "Worship and Outreach", "completion": "Obviously the two are not fundamentally opposed to each other, but does the Bible offer any general guidance as to which should predominate in the focus of planning a worship service - edification of believers in attendance or of unbelievers/\"seekers\" who may be visiting?\n\n\n\u201cMany pastors and evangelism committees have come to agree that the public worship of God that attracts and spiritually benefits members will also attract and spiritually benefit non-members.\u201d\n\u201cWorship and outreach are bound together because both of them proclaim Jesus. Therefore, worship and outreach are not mutually exclusive\u2014to be pitted against each other. Nor are they substitutes for each other\u2014as if you could replace worship with outreach or outreach with worship. Statements like \u201cThe Lutheran style of worship doesn\u2019t connect with the unchurched\u201d and \u201cOutreach has no place in worship,\u201d both miss the point that worship and outreach are joined inseparably, because both revolve around the teaching on which the Church stands or falls.\u201d\nThe question you ask requires an extensive answer, and there some good resources that address your question.\nThe first quotation is from Christian Worship: Manual.

{"prompt": "Government and public worship", "completion": "With all the government restrictions going on with COVID-19, I was wondering why we are allowing the government to tell us when we can or cannot worship together again in our places of worship (in other words, our physical gatherings) and not just going to worship together anyway?  I also understand that God has instituted the government and we should obey them, however, I feel like this is an instance of, \"We must obey God rather than men\" (Acts 5:29).\n\n\nMany Christians share your frustration. King David expressed the child of God\u2019s joy in worshiping in God\u2019s house: \u201cI rejoiced with those who said to me, \u2018Let us go to the house of the Lord\u2019\u201d (Psalm 122:1). It is disappointing not to be able to act on that joy because of the present circumstances.\nAs Christians, we seek to obey God\u2019s law as a way of expressing our gratitude to him for our free and full salvation through Jesus Christ (Romans 12:1; Ephesians 5:2; Colossians 3:17). We use his word faithfully and worship him, as we are able (the Third Commandment). We honor his representatives in government (the Fourth Commandment). We help our neighbor (the Fifth Commandment).\nGovernment mandated restrictions and limitations on public worship bring those three commandments to the forefront. The context of Acts 5:29 is the suppression of the gospel message. As stated by government officials in our country, the current restrictions and limitations on public worship result from concern for people\u2019s physical health and welfare. As disappointing as it is not to have our regular public worship life, we still have the freedom to worship with others through technology and to read our Bibles. In addition, we can honor God by honoring his representatives in government and caring for our neighbor.\nThere is nothing new with Christians honoring God\u2019s representatives in government during difficult times. There were challenging and dangerous conditions for Christians in the Roman Empire in the first century A.D., and yet consider what God had his apostles write: \u201cI urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people\u2014for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness\u201d (1 Timothy 2:1-2). \u201cShow proper respect to everyone, love the family of believers, fear God, honor the emperor\u201d (1 Peter 2:17). Those are timely words, as are these: \u201cBe joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer\u201d (Romans 12:12).\nGod speed the day when we think of Psalm 122:1 (\u201cI rejoiced with those who said to me, \u2018Let us go to the house of the Lord.\u2019\u201d) and our reaction is: \u201cIt\u2019s time!

Cursing is a violation of God\u2019s Second Commandment.\nThe Bible teaches us to use God\u2019s name to bless others and not curse (Romans 12:14; James 3:10)."}
{"prompt": "Persecution for the faith", "completion": "Lately, I've been seeing advertisements for \"Bible smuggler\" organizations like Open Doors USA, Mission without Borders, and The Voice of the Martyrs on my Facebook page. They claim to provide clandestine support to persecuted Christians in hostile countries. From what I've read on their websites, they seem legitimate both doctrinally and ethically, but I'm still skeptical. Are WELS missionaries familiar with such organizations? Would it be wise to make an official analysis or statement about them?\n\n\nI do not know WELS missionaries\u2019 level of familiarity with the organizations you mentioned.\nSpeaking for myself, I believe that the members of our Synod are equipped to compare the stated beliefs and core values of such organizations with what the Bible teaches and then arrive at accurate conclusions. That personal examination eliminates the need for any official analysis or statement.\nYour questions are timely reminders about Christian persecution. The Bible teaches that Christians can expect persecution (John 16:33; 2 Timothy 3:12; 1 Peter 4:12). Scripture teaches us to counter persecution with prayer (Matthew 5:44; Ephesians 6:18-20; Colossians 4:3; 2 Thessalonians 3:2). The Bible teaches that God will not abandon those who suffer in his name (1 Peter 5:10).

{"prompt": "Help for Amish neighbor", "completion": "I am WELS. I have a neighbor who is Amish and she struggles with the Amish bishops and all of the rules and regulations.

Thank you. \n\n\nI do not find a question in your remarks, but if you are wondering about the advice you have given to your friend, I agree with it.\nGod\u2019s will is that we read his word (John 5:39). God\u2019s instructions to the people of Israel demonstrated how much he wanted them to use his word in their daily lives (Deuteronomy 6:6-9).

{"prompt": "Nicene Creed", "completion": "In the Nicene Creed we confess that we believe that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and from the Son. What does this mean?\n\n\nThat phrase from the Creed speaks of God the Father and God the Son sending God the Holy Spirit to bless people through his powerful work in human hearts through the gospel. The basis for that phrase comes from Bible passages like these: \u201cAnd I will ask the Father, and he will give you another advocate to help you and be with you forever\u2014 the Spirit of truth\u201d (John 14:16-17). \u201cWhen the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father\u2014the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father\u2014he will testify about me\u201d (John 15:26). \u201cBut very truly I tell you, it is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you\u201d (John 16:7). Those passages demonstrate the perfect relationship of the three persons of the Trinity.\nYour question is timely as we approach Pentecost Sunday and Trinity Sunday on the church year calendar."}

We urge congregations to refrain from initiating novel approaches for celebration of the sacrament.\u2019\nThat quotation is part of a reply to a recent question concerning the same subject matter. This link will provide you with the reply in its entirety.\nThe good news is that, with some restrictions involved, churches in parts of our country are opening for public worship."}
{"prompt": "Worship styles", "completion": "Are there any WELS congregations which worship in a \"high church\" style? By which I mean liturgical worship involving the traditional common service, chanting, vestments, and the like. Is contemporary worship more common? Who decides what form of worship an individual congregation follows? Thanks!\n\n\nI do not have any data to pass along to you, but I can assure you there are WELS congregations that use \u201cthe traditional common service, chanting, vestments, and the like.\u201d Those congregations may offer that style of worship exclusively or as part of a worship schedule that includes contemporary worship or blended worship.\nYou might be interested to know that during this past school year Martin Luther College, the WELS college of ministry where I teach, used settings of The Service from the new hymnal for its morning chapel services. Those orders of service included cantors, chanting and vestments.\nYou can view the services and the printed materials on the college\u2019s website. You will have a better idea of the chapel worship experience by watching chapel services prior to March, when we were still in a face-to-face mode of education.\nCongregations will make decisions on worship services that align with their setting and circumstances. Certainly, pastors and congregational leaders will serve as resource people and advisors in helping congregations arrive at decisions.\nYour question is a reminder of the freedom Christians enjoy when it comes to their worship of the one true God. While ceremonial laws regulated God\u2019s Old Testament worshipers, there are no New Testament ceremonial laws regulating corporate worship today."}
{"prompt": "Children's messages", "completion": "Is it permissible for a woman to do the children's lesson during the church service?\n\n\nScripture of course does not address your question directly, so we need to look at scriptural principles and seek to make application from them. There is the overarching principle of selfless leading (loving head) and selfless yielding (loving helper) as men and women work together in God\u2019s world (1 Corinthians 11:3).\nScripture makes general applications of that principle in the life of the church (1 Corinthians 14:26-40; 1 Timothy 2:1-15). We recognize from those sections of the Bible that God has entrusted the authoritative teaching and preaching of his word in assemblies of his followers to men.\nCongregational leaders will need to study and apply scriptural principles when it comes to unique situations like the instruction of children with adult observers in a worship service.\nA parallel question to yours is one that asks if such a practice is beneficial, constructive and wise (1 Corinthians 6:12; 10:23-24). That question takes us in a different direction. The entire emphasis of Christian freedom is not on what we can do. In selfless love for others, Christian freedom also underscores the choice of not doing something out of consideration for the consciences of others.\nI would recommend reading a very recent restatement of \u201cMale and Female in God\u2019s World: A summary of what we believe Scripture teaches about being male and female.\u201d That document, along with accompanying materials, can assist congregations working through questions like yours."}

{"prompt": "Jesus' state of humiliation", "completion": "The Solid Declaration, Article viii, paragraph. 72 reads...\"For upon Him [Christ] the Father poured without measure the Spirit of wisdom and power, so that, as man, He has received through this personal union all knowledge and all power in deed and truth.\" and \"...so that He [Christ, according to His human nature] not only knows some things and is ignorant of others, can do some things and is unable to do others, but [according to the assumed human nature] knows and can do all things\"\r\n\r\nHow do we reconcile this with the teaching that Christ doesn't know the hour of His return, and that we say Christ 'veiled\" Himself according to His humanity? Doesn't that go against our own confessions that say He \"knows and can do all things\"?\r\n\r\n\n\n\nSome of the words you cited describe Jesus\u2019 state of humiliation\u2014that time in Jesus\u2019 earthly life when he did not always or fully use his divine powers and attributes.\nWe get an idea of what that state was like from Jesus\u2019 words of not knowing the day or hour of his visible return to this earth on the Last Day (Matthew 24:36). As God, Jesus knows all things. During his state of humiliation, when he spoke those words, Jesus chose not to tap into that knowledge about the Last Day.\nOur minds struggle to comprehend the mystery in which God and man are one in Jesus Christ. Scripture puts it this way: \u201cBeyond all question, the mystery from which true godliness springs is great: He appeared in the flesh, was vindicated by the Spirit, was seen by angels, was preached among the nations, was believed on in the world, was taken up in glory\u201d (1 Timothy 3:16).\nWhile we may not be able to understand completely the nature of our Savior, we praise him for who he is and what he has done for us: living and dying as our perfect substitute."}
{"prompt": "Deaths of Jesus' disciples", "completion": "Hello. What proof do we have the disciples were killed for their faith?\n\n\nThe Bible provides information about the martyrdom of the apostle James (Acts 12:2). Beyond that, historians and other writers offer accounts of the deaths of Jesus\u2019 disciples. It is thought that all the disciples, with the exception of John, were put to death for their faith in Jesus Christ.\nPrior to their deaths, Judas Iscariot took his own life (Matthew 27:5)."}
{"prompt": "Salvation and sin", "completion": "I have been reading about the Reformation concept \"Sola fide\" (justification by faith alone), and I have a question for the WELS leadership.  If one could become more lackadaisical with this mindset, knowing they would go to heaven regardless of following God's rules, what would your argument be against their thinking, other than appeals to emotion? I am genuinely curious about this, because I read in one post that 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 commands God's followers not to do a multitude of wicked actions, but wickedness and the baring from the Kingdom of God was due to impenitence. I suppose my question is ultimately, can a Christian be wicked, while simultaneously having faith in Jesus and being saved, since salvation comes about by being justified by faith alone, not actions, and if not due to the mere faith of the wicked, how would their disobedience to God's commands have denied themselves entry into heaven?  To rephrase this in a less scrambled manner, how immoral can one be, with a 100% chance of being saved, if they espouse faith in Christ?  \n\n\nA starting point with your questions is to recognize from the Bible that Christians are saints and sinners at the same time. Those whom the Holy Spirit has brought to saving faith in Jesus Christ are holy in God\u2019s sight (1 Peter 2:9). In spite of that gracious status, Christians do the evil that God forbids and fail to do the good God commands (Romans 7:15-25). As long as this earthly life continues, Christians will be engaged in a battle against their sinful nature that wants to lead them into sin (Galatians 5:17).\nThe question then is not a matter of \u201cHow much can I get away with and still be saved?\u201d The Bible explains that Christians will want to avoid sin as best they can through God\u2019s power and strength (Romans 6:1-4). God\u2019s forgiveness is not a license to sin. Scripture is clear that mere familiarity with Jesus will not lead to eternal blessings (Matthew 7:21).\nWhen Christians look to God\u2019s law, they will see their sins and confess them (Psalm 38:18). When Christians look to God\u2019s gospel, they will see the forgiveness of sins that Jesus Christ has won for them (Ephesians 1:7). In gratitude for that forgiveness, Christians strive to distance themselves from sin and, instead, live life God\u2019s way (2 Corinthians 5:14-15).\nIn this life, Christians will never reach perfection when it comes to their repentance, faith and Christian living (Philippians 3:12). In this life, Christians are saints and sinners at the same time. They are people who enjoy forgiveness of sins because of their connection in faith to Jesus Christ, who lived a holy life in their place and endured the punishment of their sins. They are people who are engaged in the lifelong struggle against their sinful nature and Satan. The Christian\u2019s confidence of salvation results from what Jesus Christ has done for them\u2014not what they have or have not done (Ephesians 2:8-9)."}
{"prompt": "Making amends", "completion": "Hi,\r\nI am having a bit of problem that I am not sure how to solve in regard to correcting wrongs. You see when I was a college student, my friend lent me his Netflix login info for about a year. I used it on a few occasions throughout the year and went on to get my own Netflix account. But I still feel guilty because I did not pay for it when my friend lent me his. You see lending someone else your Netflix info is a violation of the Terms of Service (which I did not while I was using my friend's account). I want to try to pay Netflix back, but my family says that seems crazy since Netflix is a transaction based business and does not take donations (This would cost $192 total).\r\nSimilarly, for the last 3 years of my college education I have had an Amazon Prime Student Account which is half the price of a regular prime account. I was unaware of this until last week, but I found out from the Terms of Service that I am not supposed to share my account or account benefits with my family (My mom runs the account). I feel guilty and want to pay Amazon for those three years as a regular account (Which would cost $360 total).\r\nI know that God forgives me and I know that I cannot correct everything I have done wrong. I just want to correct the things I can.  I do not know if I am doing this to please God or instead appease my guilty conscience and sense of pride.  I just want your opinion on if trying to pay the money back is an idea that makes sense, or should I just ask God for forgiveness and move on?\r\n\n\n\nAs Christians, we confess our sins to God (Psalm 32:5). We know that such confession is not meaningless; God forgives sins (1 John 1:9).\nYour question concerns fruits of repentance: undoing a wrong or making amends for what we have done. Since you stated that you cannot make donations to the companies you mentioned, I imagine a course of action could be buying gift cards for those businesses and then giving them to others. That way, you would be returning money to the businesses without deriving personal benefit. The decision on what to do is entirely yours.\nIf you do happen to go that route, I trust you will maintain the distinction between proper fruits of repentance and improper thoughts about the forgiveness of sins. God\u2019s forgiveness is full and free. Our actions do not contribute to our forgiveness (Titus 3:5). God\u2019s blessings to you and your family!"}
{"prompt": "Meat and milk", "completion": "1 Cor 3:2 \"I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is the meat and where can I get it? I still feel like all I am fed is milk. \n\n\nThe apostle Paul used the imagery of milk and solid food to describe how he ministered to spiritually immature Christians in Corinth. That imagery is what the writer to the Hebrews also employed (Hebrews 5:13-14).\nThe \u201cmeat\u201d of the Christian faith refers to the deeper doctrines of the Bible and the scriptural truths that are challenging to our human minds.\nI would say that a good place to get that \u201cmeat\u201d is at congregational Bible studies. Bible classes offer a question and answer and discussion format that can help guide Christians through a study of Scripture\u2014including those parts that are easy and those that are more difficult to understand."}
{"prompt": "John's Baptism", "completion": "Was the Baptism of John the Baptist the same as the Baptism done by the disciples after the ascension of Jesus?\n\n\nThrough John the Baptist\u2019s preaching, God changed the hearts of people. Sinners were led to confess their sins and acknowledge Jesus of Nazareth as the promised Messiah, the Lamb of God (John 1:29).\nThe Baptism John performed sealed God\u2019s forgiveness to people. The Baptism John performed provided the vehicle through which the Holy Spirit could produce and strengthen faith, and also repentance in people\u2019s hearts. The Holy Spirit changes hearts through the gospel in word and sacrament. John\u2019s Baptism was essentially the same as that done by Jesus\u2019 disciples after his ascension into heaven."}
{"prompt": "Jesus and angels", "completion": "Was Jesus one of God's angels?\n\n\nAngels are created beings, created during the six days of creation. As the eternal Son of God, Jesus was involved in their creation (John 1:1-3). Rather than being an angel, Jesus created the angels.\nWhat can confuse people, I imagine, is that the Bible sometimes calls Jesus \u201cthe angel of the Lord.\u201d When he appeared to people before he took on human flesh at his birth at Bethlehem, the Bible calls Jesus \u201cthe angel of the Lord.\u201d Genesis 16:7-16 is one of those sections in the Bible that describes such an appearance.\nWhat can eliminate that confusion is keeping in mind that the basic definition of \u201cangel\u201d is \u201cmessenger.\u201d When Jesus appeared to people prior to his incarnation, he brought messages concerning God\u2019s plan of salvation\u2014that centered in him."}
{"prompt": "COVID-19 and Communion", "completion": "A friend gave me books by Joseph Prince, describing how we can give ourselves Holy Communion every day if we choose during this COVID-19 time. I am skeptical about this. Is this approved by WELS? Is it vital that we continue even in different times to administer the body and blood of Christ to ourselves? I had never heard of this. Thank you. \n\n\nThankfully, restrictions on gathering for corporate worship, which includes receiving the Lord\u2019s Supper, are easing.\nWhen there were tighter restrictions two months ago, a Together newsletter contained information about the celebration of the Lord\u2019s Supper.

{"prompt": "Contemplative/centering prayers", "completion": "I am hearing about contemplative prayer and centering prayer. Because I can\u2019t find a crystal clear definition of either, I\u2019m not certain whether they\u2019re the same or different things. If either involves emptying the mind, I realize that\u2019s of Eastern religion and not biblical. Yet I hear of so-called Christians doing these practices, and want to respond biblically. Please enlighten me on these terms. \n\n\nThe terms are often used interchangeably. The terms describe an approach to prayer associated with Christian mysticism. That approach seeks to affect one\u2019s consciousness by means of repeating words and employing breathing techniques. This has the supposed purpose of assisting people to listen to the voice of God.\nConsidering this, you have reason to be concerned about the practice. Prayer certainly is communication with God, but that communication is not to consist of \u201cbabbling\u201d (Matthew 6:7). Communicating with God in prayer also does not mean that we put our minds in neutral (1 Corinthians 14:15). No, prayer is communication with God that involves our entire being.\nWhile prayer is our means of communicating with God, God has told us that he communicates with people through his word, the Bible (Hebrews 1:1-2). We do not look for God to speak to us beyond his written word.\nDo remind others of the wonderful privilege of prayer that God has given his children. Your reminders can also include what the Bible does and does not teach about prayer."}
{"prompt": "Athanasian Creed wording", "completion": "I am a lifelong member of WELS. I am very happy that the WELS is a Bible teaching church, but I have a problem with the end of the Athanasian Creed - \"Those who have done good will enter eternal life, but those who have done evil will go into eternal fire.\" That statement is not the true Christian faith as the next sentence in the creed calls out. I've read your responses to others who had made similar comments concerning the Athanasian Creed. The reader of the Athanasian Creed is to understand that the statement \"Those who have done good will enter eternal life, but those who have done evil will go into eternal fire\" implies that those who believe in Jesus as their Savior will receive forgiveness for their sins, and thereby be saved, while those who do not believe that Jesus is their Savior will receive eternal damnation.  I was hoping that the new WELS hymnal will either eliminate the Athanasian Creed altogether, or add an explanation below the creed clarifying the questionable statements at the end. The WELS does a very good job preaching and teaching that salvation is only obtained through faith in Jesus, and not by good works, but then once every year on Trinity Sunday they kind of contradict that good and solid doctrine by using the Athanasian Creed. Is there any plan to address this issue in the new hymnal?      \n\n\nYour question is one that many people ask when they read the Athanasian Creed. Your question also demonstrates the value of providing an explanation\u2014in the service folder or by way of verbal announcement\u2014when congregations use the Athanasian Creed in a worship service.\nThe section of the creed you cited reflects the language of Scripture regarding God\u2019s judgment of humanity (Matthew 16:27; John 5:28-29; Romans 2:6-10; 2 Corinthians 5:10). God certainly judges what is in the heart. It is faith in Jesus Christ alone that saves, and it is unbelief that condemns (Mark 16:16). Salvation is entirely God\u2019s doing; we do not contribute to our salvation in any way (Romans 3:28; Galatians 3:11; Ephesians 2:8-9).\nWhat Scripture does explain is that saving faith and condemning unbelief manifest themselves in people\u2019s lives. And so on the last day, the Lord will point out the good works that Christians have done and the sins that unbelievers have committed (Matthew 25:31-46). Those good works of Christians were not the payment for their salvation; the good works were the evidence of Spirit-worked saving faith in Jesus who paid the penalty for their sins. The sins of unbelievers will be singled out because they rejected the only means of forgiveness for their sins.\nWhat the parable of the sheep and the goats illustrates is that God will demonstrate how fair a judge he is. He judges what is in the heart. A person cannot see into the heart of another as God can, so God will provide the evidence for the judgment of the heart that he made. Once again, that parable shows us that on the last day no sins of believers will be brought up. That is because there are no sins to bring up; Christians enjoy complete forgiveness of sins through faith in Christ. On the other hand, the sins of unbelievers will be mentioned because they cannot do good works (Romans 14:23) and, because they have rejected the only means of forgiveness, their sins condemn them.\nWe could think of the section in the Athanasian Creed (\u201cThose who have done good will enter eternal life, but those who have done evil will go into eternal fire.\u201d) this way: \u201cThose who believed in Jesus as their Savior\u2014and saving faith always produces visible fruit\u2014will enter eternal life, but those who rejected Jesus\u2014such people cannot perform good works, nor do they enjoy forgiveness of sins\u2014will go into eternal fire.\u201d\nWhile the wording of the Athanasian Creed will not be changed in the new hymnal, there are plans to include introductory paragraphs that will provide a brief explanation of the sentence you questioned. The explanation will focus on thoughts stated earlier in this response."}
{"prompt": "CARES Act and congregations", "completion": "Should WELS churches take government money meant for small businesses?  Church is non-profit?  Is this part of separation of church and state?\r\n\n\n\nOne of the programs of the CARES Act was the Paycheck Protection Program. It was \u201cdesigned to keep small businesses, including qualifying non-profit organizations, afloat during mandated Coronavirus Disease 2019 (\u2018COVID-19\u2019) related closures.\u201d\u00a0 The program provided potentially forgivable loans for small businesses, which included nonprofit organizations like churches. Each WELS congregation had the responsibility of determining whether or not to participate in that program. Below is information that WELS shared with called workers in April 2020:\n\u201cOne program under the CARES Act receiving quite a bit of attention is the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Under the PPP, certain businesses, including nonprofit organizations (which would include WELS congregations and WELS affiliated ministries) may be eligible to receive a potentially forgivable loan through the Small Business Administration (SBA). Generally, the loans are for the lessor of $10,000,000 or 2.5 times the 2019 average monthly payroll cost. PPP loans may be helpful to nonprofit organizations by providing money to those organizations to pay for certain qualifying expenses, such as payroll costs for called and hired workers who are still employed, mortgage and rent payments, and utility costs.\n\u201cWe do not view this as a dependence on the government for carrying out ministry; rather it should be viewed as a type of restitution to compensate for financial hardships resulting from government actions to mitigate the spread of the infection.\n\u201cWe also encourage all of our members to realize that financial assistance from the government is not a substitute for faithful Christian stewardship. Please remember to support your congregation\u2019s ministry and called workers with your faithful offerings, even if you are not able to gather for worship.\u201d\nAnother provision of the CARES Act provides charitable contribution incentives. That provision created a new \u201cabove the line\u201d deduction (i.e. for taxpayers who take the standard deduction). This deduction will permit them to deduct up to $300 of annual monetary contributions."}

{"prompt": "Governmental authorities and honor", "completion": "God tells us in the fourth commandment that we are to respect our governmental authorities that he places over us. I know this for a fact and have believed it all my life. However, certain recent events have raised significant doubts within me about this teaching, primarily because I do not believe that an appropriate punishment for attempting to use counterfeit money is getting beaten severely and then choked to death in the streets. I am also aware of several other passages from God's Word that all seem to command the same thing when interpreted in a modern sense, which is don't be a racist. (Matthew 22:36-40, Galatians 3:28, and John 3:16 to name a few). \r\n\r\nMy question is this: is a government with policies, implicit or not, that directly affect a certain racial group or people worthy of the respect outlined within the Fourth Commandment? Along with this, if I am deeply unsatisfied with an issue that might affect me or others, how do I protest it without breaking the fourth commandment?\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\u201cSubmit yourselves for the Lord\u2019s sake to every human authority: whether to the emperor, as the supreme authority, or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right\u2026honor the emperor\u201d (1 Peter 2:13-14, 17).\nWhat is remarkable about those words is their historical context. The individual who filled the role of Roman emperor at the time of Peter\u2019s writing was none other than Nero\u2014cruel, Christian-hating Nero. By no means did Nero deserve respect or honor because of his sinful actions. On the other hand, Nero occupied a position of honor. He was in that position because of God\u2019s allowance (Romans 13:1-7). Nero\u2019s personal behavior did not remove the instruction to \u201chonor\u201d from Peter\u2019s words.\nNero is an example of a person who did not represent God well. According to the Fourth Commandment, God has representatives in the home, the church and the government. Some of those representatives represent God well; others do not. If a parent does not represent God well, that does not mean all parents fail to represent God the way he wants. If a pastor does not represent God well, that does not mean all pastors are failures at representing God the way he wants. If a government official does not represent God well, that does not mean all government officials fail to represent God the way he wants.\nIf you are deeply unsatisfied with an issue that might affect you or others, there are legal and peaceful ways for you to express your dissatisfaction and seek remedies. Some of those ways include peaceful assemblies, petitions and letters to representatives. Above all, you have prayer as a powerful resource to bring about change. Consider this instruction, again written during the time of Emperor Nero: \u201cI urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people\u2014for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness\u201d (1 Timothy 2:1-2).\nHere is such a prayer: \u201cLord of all nations, I praise you for the blessings you have showered on my country. Guide and guard your representatives in government as they care for the needs of all citizens. Give them wisdom to rule our society with honesty and justice, that we may have peace in our lives and opportunities to witness to your love. Amen.\u201d (Christian Worship, 136)"}

{"prompt": "Samaritans and Jews", "completion": "With the past week or more, we have been hit with many racial accusations of hated and purposeful actions. As I look back through the Bible, I see justifications on both sides for the particular reaction. I read about the Samaritans and the Jews. Please provide other tribal disparities in the Bible that I can reference. Thank you. \n\n\nThere was bad blood between Samaritans and Jews going back to the 8th century B.C. That was when the Assyrians moved people into the areas of northern Israel vacated by Israelites who were taken into captivity in Assyria. Those transplants became known as Samaritans.\nI do not know if this is the information you are seeking, but here are some biblical references that show how the people of Israel were to distance themselves from surrounding, heathen nations: Deuteronomy 23:3-6; Ezra 10:10-44; Nehemiah 13:1-3. The reason for that distancing was religious in nature: God did not want the people of Israel to pollute themselves with ideas of false religions.\nAt the same time, because God loves all people (John 3:16), he wanted the people of Israel to declares his praises to others so that they too could enjoy his forgiving love through faith in the promised Messiah (Psalm 96:2-3; Isaiah 43:10, 12, 21; Jonah 4:1-11).\nThat outreach\u2014along with Christian mission and evangelism activity of all time\u2014achieved its goal, as evidenced by what the apostle John saw in one of his visions: \u201cAfter this I looked, and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb\u201d (Revelation 7:9)."}

Jesus said that it is the lack of faith, not the lack of Baptism, that condemns (Mark 16:16).\nBaptism is not absolutely necessary in that the Holy Spirit can bring people to saving faith through the Word alone. In cases like that, people will still want to be baptized\u2014to do what Jesus says and to receive, in addition to the message of the Bible, another guarantee of God\u2019s love and forgiveness in Christ.\nBaptism is necessary in the sense that the Lord commands us to administer Baptism. It is not for us to decide whether or not we are going to do what the Lord says.\nYour question is a good reminder of the blessings of Baptism: \u201cSo in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ\u201d (Galatians 3:26-27)."}
{"prompt": "The works of the Trinity", "completion": "Today was Trinity Sunday and we talked about having three distinct persons in one God. I was wondering - because there is one God - could you say that the Father and Holy Spirit also descended into hell? We talk about the Father creating heaven and earth, but the Holy Spirit hovered over the waters and Jesus was the Word who \"all things were made by him\" (John 1).  They obviously were involved with creation too, so where's the line? Could you say that the Father and Holy Spirit took part in dying on the cross or descending into hell?\n\n\nThe general nature of your questions about the persons of the Trinity fills pages of dogmatics textbooks. Our minds struggle to make sense of what we believe: that there are three persons yet one God.\nWhile our Catechism ascribes works to the persons of the Trinity (Father: creation; Son: redemption; Holy Spirit: sanctification), all three persons were involved in those works. You demonstrated how that was true regarding creation.\nConcerning redemption, the Bible speaks of the Father\u2019s involvement in sending his Son (John 3:16) and the Holy Spirit\u2019s involvement in the conception of Christ (Matthew 1:20; Luke 1:35), but only the second person of the Trinity took on human flesh. With a body, only Jesus died on the cross and descended into hell. Before he died, Jesus said, \u201cFather, into your hands I commit my spirit\u201d (Luke 23:46). You might be interested to know that Including the Father with Jesus\u2019 death is an ancient heresy that dogmatics textbooks treat.\nThere are mysteries in the Christian faith, and the nature of God is one of them. Through the work of the Holy Spirit, Christian faith embraces those mysteries, while trying to understand them better."}
{"prompt": "Importance of every person", "completion": "Is it okay to say all lives matter?\n\n\nThat is a theologically accurate statement. Arguably the most well-known passage in the Bible, John 3:16 states that \u201cGod so loved the world.\u201d 2 Corinthians 5:15 teaches that Jesus \u201cdied for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again.\u201d 1 Timothy 2:4 makes it clear that God \u201cwants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.\u201d 2 Peter 3:9 restates that truth: \u201cThe Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Angels and people", "completion": "My WELS grandchildren believe that a distant deceased adolescent Catholic cousin is an angel and he is now watching over them. The deceased mother is the advocator of this angel theory. They admire the deceased cousin and his mother. I understand the Bible teaches there are a fixed number of angels, nevertheless I am struggling to clearly clarify this issue for them. \n\n\nThe Bible teaches that there are great differences between angels and people. While we know that God created Adam and Eve on the sixth day (Genesis 1:26-31; 2:4-25), the Bible does not specifically mention on what day God created the angels.\nAngels are spirit beings (Hebrews 1:14) with no physical bodies. Human beings have bodies and souls. When death takes place, body and soul separate (Ecclesiastes 12:7). The souls of Christians are then in heaven, while their bodies remain on earth (Luke 23:43; Revelation 6:9-11). On the Last Day, the Lord will raise their bodies and reunite bodies and souls (Job 19:25-27; John 5:28-29).\nConfusion about angels and people often arises by a misunderstanding of passages like these: \u201cAt the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven\u201d (Matthew 22:30) and \u201cThe people of this age marry and are given in marriage. But those who are considered worthy of taking part in the age to come and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage, and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God\u2019s children, since they are children of the resurrection\u201d (Luke 20:34-36).\nJesus spoke the words of the passages above in response to a question about marriage, death and eternity. Jesus explained that marriage is an earthly blessing only. When Christians die, they become \u201clike the angels\u201d in that they live apart from God\u2019s institution of marriage and they \u201ccan no longer die.\u201d The word \u201clike\u201d is all-important in the passages above. Jesus did not say his followers become angels upon death; Christians who die are \u201clike\u201d angels for the reasons given.\nOne last thought. There is a significant difference between angels and human beings when it comes to salvation. Angels are certainly interested in people\u2019s salvation (Luke 15:10; 1 Peter 1:12), but it is people who are the objects of God\u2019s redeeming love (Hebrews 2).\nHopefully, you can share information like this with your grandchildren to clarify the difference between angels and people. God bless you all."}
{"prompt": "WELS and Scripture", "completion": "Why does the WELS believe Scripture should be taken literally?\n\n\nThe goal of biblical interpretation is to understand the words in the way the author intended. Allow me to distinguish among and explain several terms of biblical interpretation. When we accept at face value the ordinary meanings of words, we are following a literal interpretation. When figures of speech or genre make it clear that the author is using figurative or symbolic language, we interpret figuratively. If we disregard figures of speech and genre and interpret literally, we are interpreting literalistically\u2014and that is wrong.\nWe confess this in This We Believe: \u201cWe believe and accept the Bible on its own terms, accepting as factual history what it presents as history and recognizing as figurative speech what is evident as such. We believe that Scripture must interpret Scripture, clear passages throwing light on those less easily understood. We believe that no authority\u2013whether it is human reason, science, or scholarship\u2013may stand in judgment over Scripture. Sound scholarship will faithfully search out the true meaning of Scripture without presuming to pass judgment on it.\u201d\nNorthwestern Publishing House offers good, reliable books on the subject of biblical interpretation. I commend them to you for your reading."}

Did she not know animals (snakes) cannot talk?   \n\n\nThe biblical record is simply that \u201cthe serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the LORD God had made\u201d (Genesis 3:1), and Eve \u201cwas deceived\u201d (1 Timothy 2:14).\nAdam was also a rational human being, but he followed Eve\u2019s sinful lead (Genesis 3:6).\nThankfully for them and for us, God promised a Savior to crush the serpent\u2019s head (Genesis 3:15). Jesus is that Savior. Satan\u2019s final and complete defeat lies in the future (Revelation 20:2, 10)."}
{"prompt": "The Moravian Church and WELS", "completion": "Could you explain the difference in beliefs between the WELS church and the Moravian church?\n\n\nThe motto of the Moravian Church is \u201cIn essentials, unity; in non-essentials, liberty; and in all things, love.\u201d Their website spells out what they consider to be the \u201cessentials\u201d \u2013 \u201cGod creates (and God\u2019s creation is good), God redeems, God blesses; and we respond by having faith in what God has done and is doing; by loving God, loving ourselves, loving our neighbors and loving our enemies; and by looking to the future with hope because we know we will be with God.\u201d\nWhat is not essential for the Moravian Church is doctrinal unity. That explains the ecumenical nature of the church. It is a charter member of the World Council of Churches and the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the United States. It is in full communion with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA). The church practices open communion. Its statement on the nature of Holy Communion is ambiguous. Its clergy roster includes women.\nThe Moravian Church is known for its mission work. One wishes that the church would have greater concern for doctrinal unity. People benefit the most when they are presented with all the truths of God\u2019s word."}
{"prompt": "Women authors", "completion": "What do you think of men reading books and devotions written by women?

It would not be wrong for a man to read those books"}
{"prompt": "The Promised Land", "completion": "According to the Bible, why did the Jewish people lose the Promised Land? Was it because they disobeyed God or was it because of some other reason? The modern state of Israel is a reality based on a number of events that have taken place in world history. However, beyond that, can modern Jews substantiate a right to the land based on the Bible? \n\n\nGod made it clear to the people of Israel that he was the owner of the Promised Land and they were \u201cforeigners and strangers\u201d in it (Leviticus 25:23). Moses warned the people that their disobedience of the Lord\u2019s commands would lead to their forfeiture of the land (Deuteronomy 28:63-64). Sadly, Old Testament history relates the people\u2019s disobedience and the subsequent troubles they experienced.\nThe Bible does not address the modern nation of Israel. Through faith in Jesus, God wants all people\u2014Jews and Gentiles alike\u2014to enjoy the blessings of the heavenly Jerusalem (Hebrews 12:22)."}
{"prompt": "Church and truth", "completion": "Someone I know recently made the comment that WELS is the only church left teaching God's Word in its truth and purity.  I found her statement hard to believe considering the doctrine of the church. Her statement really bothered me for variety of reasons. So I did some research and I came across this answer on a similar topic on your Q and A page \u201cAs a church body, we do not pretend to be the only church whose teachings are entirely biblical; the kingdom of God is not limited to WELS.\u201d How do I lovingly point this out to her?\n\n\nYou could share with your friend the question and answer you referenced.\nYou might also want to share the following excerpts from an article in Forward in Christ from a number of years ago.\n\u201cOver the years the writer has been pastor and member of a number of WELS congregations. In worshiping, these congregations never confessed their faith by saying, \u2018I believe in St. Peter\u2019s Ev. Lutheran Church,\u2019 or \u2018I believe in St. Mark\u2019s Lutheran Church.\u2019 Instead they voiced their confession in the well-known words of the Apostles\u2019 Creed: \u2018I believe in the Holy Ghost; the holy Christian church, the communion of saints. .. .\u2019\n\u201cIt is evident, then, that the word \u2018church\u201d is used in different senses. It may mean a building where people worship, a congregation, a denomination, the whole visible church, the true believers gathered at one place, or the sum total of true believers\u2026The visible church may have in its midst hypocrites, but the holy Christian church consists of true believers only. It is important that we note this, lest we identify any denomination as the alone saving church here on earth and thus automatically consign the members of all other denominations to eternal damnation.\n\u201cThe matter of the holy Christian church is spoken of in paragraphs 1, 2 and 10a of This We Believe, Article VII.\n\u201cWe believe that there is one holy Christian church, which is the temple of God (1 Corinthians 3:16), the body of Christ (Ephesians 1:23; 4:12). The members of this one church are all those who are \u2018the sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus\u2019 (Galatians 3:26). Whoever believes that Jesus died for his sin and rose again for his justification (Romans 4:25) belongs to Christ\u2019s church. The church, then, consists only of believers, or saints, whom God accepts as holy for the sake of Jesus\u2019 imputed righteousness (2 Corinthians 5:21). These saints are scattered throughout the world. Every true believer, regardless of the nation or race or church body to which he belongs, is a member of the holy Christian church.\n\u201cWe believe that the holy Christian church is a reality, although it is not an external, visible organization. Because \u2018man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart\u2019 (1 Samuel 16:7), only the Lord knows \u2018those who are his\u2019 (2 Timothy 2: 19). The members of the holy Christian church are known only to God; we cannot distinguish between true believers and hypocrites. The holy Christian church is therefore invisible and cannot be identified with any one church body or the sum total of all church bodies.\n\u201cWe reject any attempt to identify the holy Christian church with an outward organization.\n\u201cA close reading of the above brings out the fact that it is not our name on a membership list that assures us of being a member of God\u2019s church. Rather, it is faith and trust in our Lord Jesus Christ and what he has done for us. God accepts us because of Christ\u2019s work of redemption, not because of our holiness or righteousness.\n\u201cSince we cannot look in the hearts of people, we naturally ask: Is there some way by which we can determine where the holy Christian church is present? The answer of This We Believe, on the basis of Scripture, is: \u2018The means of grace are \u2026 the marks of the church.\u2019 Wherever the gospel is preached and the sacraments are administered, the holy Christian church is present, for through the means of grace true faith is produced and preserved (Isaiah 55:10,11).\u201d\nFinally, you might also share with your friend news like this that illustrates there are other churches around the world that faithfully confess and teach the truths of God\u2019s word. It is a joy to find a common faith and enjoy fellowship with them.\nGod bless your conversation."}
{"prompt": "Training for fitness and self-defense", "completion": "I enjoy training in self-defense for fitness and for the protection of my person and my loved ones. We do not train to cause trouble but to avoid it if at all possible. When it's not possible but appears inevitable, we train to respond with total commitment and violence when necessary until a threat is neutralized. Within this, there are, obviously, threat levels and response levels, but the techniques can be brutal and must be applied with great discretion. Scripture says not to \"clothe oneself in violence\" (sic), which seems to leave room for self-protection. Is this training incompatible with Christianity or does it come down to, as I suspect, the intent behind it? Thank you.\n\n\nSome Christians look to Matthew 5:39 and Romans 12:17 as absolute directives not to resist physical threats. In their context though the verses advocate love toward others instead of seeking revenge.\nOthers look to sections of Scripture like Proverbs 24:11-12 and Luke 22:35-38 as the basis for defending oneself and one\u2019s family from physical threats.\nChristians, individually, will need to examine their consciences\u2014and motives, as you suggested\u2014to determine if and to what extent they might defend themselves and their property.\nPsalm 73:6 states: \u201cTherefore pride is their necklace; they clothe themselves with violence.\u201d Asaph, the inspired psalm writer, was describing \u201cthe wicked\u201d (Psalm 73:2). He used picturesque language to describe how the ungodly \u201cdress\u201d themselves. Pride dangles from their neck as a necklace, and violence covers their bodies like clothing.\nBy contrast, the Bible instructs Christians: \u201cTherefore, as God\u2019s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity\u201d (Colossians 3:12-14). Christians wear a much different kind of \u201cclothing.\u201d But, again, Christians will determine whether or not to move into self-defense mode to protect the life God has given them and others. I certainly cannot label training for fitness and possible self-defense as wrong."}
{"prompt": "Serpent seed doctrine", "completion": "Where did the \"serpent seed\" doctrine originate?\n\n\nThe serpent seed doctrine is the false idea that Cain was the offspring of Eve and Satan, the serpent. There is a reference to that false idea in the Gospel of Philip, a non-canonical writing that is thought to have been written between 150 and 350 A.D.\nThere is no serpent seed doctrine in the Bible. Satan presented Eve with a temptation that involved fruit. Through Satan, sin entered the world. Thanks be to God for sending Jesus, his Son, to destroy the work of Satan (1 John 3:8)."}
{"prompt": "Information about Mary's pregnancy", "completion": "Mary and Joseph did everything in their power to hide the fact that Mary was pregnant through a virgin birth. How in the world did the gospel writers find out?\n\n\nThe Bible does not tell us everything about Joseph and Mary\u2019s actions regarding her miraculous pregnancy. We do know that Joseph was interested in sparing Mary from \u201cpublic disgrace\u201d (Matthew 1:19).\nIn the beginning of his gospel, the evangelist Luke states: \u201cMany have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. With this in mind, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I too decided to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught\u201d (Luke 1:1-4). Did that investigation include speaking to Mary? We do not know.\nWe do know that Jesus, on the cross, instructed John to take care of Mary (John 19:25-27). Did John at some point relay information from Mary to Luke? We do not know that either.\nAt any rate, we want to keep in mind that the doctrine of verbal inspiration means that the Bible writers wrote down exactly\u2014to the very word (1 Corinthians 2:13)\u2014what God wanted them to write down. They might have received their information directly from God that even covered events well before their lifetimes. (Think of Moses writing about creation.) The Holy Spirit is responsible for the Bible\u2019s contents. (2 Peter 1:20-21)"}

But woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has gone down to you! He is filled with fury, because he knows that his time is short.\u201d\nSatan does not know when the Last Day will be (Matthew 24:36).

{"prompt": "God and governments", "completion": "How is voting not more than a guessing game of who God has decided already to put in?  I was shocked after a conservative judge said gays could take pride in a ruling redefining sex.  God must somehow be behind this decision since God\u2019s permissive will is still his will.  So, what do you think God is doing?  I know he will work it out for our good, but do you have any ideas besides that?  And it kind of makes no sense to vote, does it, because God really does the picking?  It seems voting puts our trust in our ability to pick, because God\u2019s will may be way different than who we want in or think will be best in God\u2019s plan of salvation.  Thanks for reading this. \n\n\nWhat can help sort things out is keeping in mind that there is a great difference between God\u2019s foreknowledge and people\u2019s actions. God certainly knows everything that is going to take place, but that is quite different from God pre-determining people\u2019s actions\u2014which he does not do. There is a difference between foreknowing and predetermining. God gives people a great deal of freedom to make decisions regarding their earthly life and circumstances. Electing governmental officials is one of those areas of freedom.\nRegardless of how people use their freedom in electing governmental officials, God will certainly carry out his good and gracious will; he will do everything for the good of his Church. Beyond that, we cannot pretend to know which specific good things God might bring from individual actions like a judicial opinion.\nVoting is a civic responsibility and privilege. If you choose not to vote in an election, you really forfeit your say and provide the potential for others to impact your life because of the votes they cast and the outcome of an election.\nRather than using Scripture as their guide, governments operate on the basis of human reason and human law. As there can be weaknesses with those sources, it is not surprising to be disappointed by governments and governmental officials. That is why it is so important to carry out this instruction: \u201cI urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people\u2014for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness\u201d (1 Timothy 2:1-2).\nThe King of kings, Jesus, will never disappoint us."}
{"prompt": "Cremation vs. burial", "completion": "What is WELS\u2019 official position on cremation?  We are faced with opposition based on feelings that we are doomed to hell upon cremation of our remains.  We don't agree, as we have read documents from LCMS and other conservative groups that cremation is an \"option.\u201d  We hold to the feelings of Christ's return, and our bodies will be raised regardless if buried in a casket or in an urn.  We believe in Christ\u2019s return!  He will take charge of our remains regardless of how they appear.  Thank you for your prayerful thoughts.   \n\n\nI am sorry to hear about the difficulties you are experiencing. Scripture is silent on the issue of cremation, so our church body does not have an official stance on the subject. Individuals have freedom to choose between traditional burial and cremation. To remove that freedom would amount to burdening consciences.\nThere was a time when some voices in the Christian church cautioned against cremation. In a day and age when some unbelievers utilized cremation as a way to defy God (\u201cLet\u2019s see if this supposed God can put me back together some day.\u201d), some Christians advocated that followers of the Lord not cremate their bodies, so as not to be associated with unbelievers or an activity of unbelievers.\nThat type of taunting has largely disappeared, so Christians today who make use of cremation are not likely to be confused with unbelievers. The choice of cremation over burial often includes ecological, economical and convenience factors. In the end, cremation essentially speeds up the process that occurs with traditional burial: \u201cDust you are and to dust you will return\u201d (Genesis 3:19). And, regardless of cremation or burial, \u201cAll who are in their graves will hear his [Jesus\u2019] voice and come out\u201d (John 5:28-29).\nWhat a blessing for you to know and believe in \u201cthe resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting\u201d (The Apostles\u2019 Creed). God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Sinful thoughts", "completion": "I know WELS and other confessional Lutherans don't ordain practicing homosexuals. But I wonder if confessional Lutherans would ordain persons who have homosexual temptations yet live a chaste life. What about a bisexual man who is married to a woman, yet repents daily of his homosexual thoughts and struggles against it like he does with his heterosexual lust? Is this man automatically excluded from the office of the keys because of his sinful sexual desires, even if he doesn't live them out?\n\n\nThe Bible does teaches that people can transgress God\u2019s holy law by their thoughts (Matthew 5:28; 1 John 3:15). Being tempted with thoughts of breaking the fifth and sixth commandments (the content matter of those Bible passages) would not disqualify a person from serving in the public ministry. The same would be true of a person being tempted with thoughts of breaking any other commandments of God.\nIf not checked, sinful thoughts of course can lead to sinful actions (James 1:13-15), and some actions can disqualify a person from serving in the public ministry (1 Timothy 3:1-7; Titus 1:6-9).\nWe can put your questions in perspective by keeping mind that God alone knows our thoughts (Psalm 139:2). No one will know our thoughts unless we share them with others. At the same time, we want to recognize that God\u2019s will is that we have pure thoughts (Psalm 51:10; Philippians 4:8).\nYour questions underscore the need for daily repentance. When we confess our sins, God responds with the message of the forgiveness of sins through his gospel (1 John 1:9). We have forgiveness because Jesus was perfect in our place (Hebrews 4:15; 7:26). He had no impure thoughts. He took our sinful thoughts and words and actions to the cross, and received the punishment those sins deserved (Isaiah 53:4-5). God\u2019s forgiveness now provides strength and motivation to lead holy lives and to resist temptations to sin (2 Corinthians 5:15)."}

{"prompt": "End times", "completion": "Will the dead face end times? Then why should we be afraid, since we will die before end times?\n\n\nThe Bible speaks of the time between Jesus\u2019 earthly ministry and Judgment Day as the \u201clast days\u201d (Hebrews 1:1-2). We are living in that time. What we do not know is if we are living in that \u201cshort time\u201d (Revelation 20:3) before Judgment Day when Satan will be given more flexibility and freedom to do his dastardly work.\nWhen death takes place, the body and soul separate, judgment takes place (Ecclesiastes 12:7; Hebrews 9:27) and souls are in heaven or hell (Luke 16:19-31). That means that those who die are no longer affected by what takes place on earth\u2014during these \u201clast days.\u201d\nWe also want to keep in mind that just as we do not know the hour of Jesus\u2019 visible return on the Last Day (Matthew 24:36), so we do not know when our death might take place."}

A few verses later, the apostle Paul wrote: \u201cTherefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbor, for we are all members of one body\u201d (Ephesians 4:25).

Perhaps there is actually no \"ushering\" involved, as when a believer closes their eyes in death they simply find yourself in the presence of the Lord in heaven.  Thanks for any help you can offer.  I'm just curious as to how we should speak (according to Scripture) about the \"ushering\" into heaven of believers who die between Christ's Ascension and his return for Judgment.\r\n\n\n\nLuke 16:22 speaks of Lazarus and angels who \u201ccarried him to Abraham\u2019s side\u201d (Luke 16:22). Is it possible that angels provide similar service to all believers who die? It is possible. Scripture does not explicitly teach that.\nDoes Jesus himself usher believers home to heaven? The Bible does not teach that. Jesus promised the repentant thief that he would be with him in paradise that day (Luke 23:43). There is no mention of Jesus ushering him home.\nThe apostle Paul wrote of his desire \u201cto depart and be with Christ\u201d (Philippians 1:23). Paul\u2019s words illustrate that being with Jesus in heaven is of utmost importance. Death provides the opportunity for Christians to leave this world and be with Jesus in heaven. According to Scripture, we can speak of Christians who have died in the faith as being in heaven. The Bible\u2019s emphasis is clearly on the location of believers\u2019 souls after death, without any description of the soul\u2019s immediate transition from earth to heaven.\n1 Thessalonians 4:13-17 describes what will take place on the Last Day. Jesus will return visibly to this world. He will be accompanied by the souls of believers who were in heaven with him. Christians who are alive on the earth on the Last Day will \u201cmeet the Lord in the air\u201d (verse 17).\nWhile we may have unanswered questions about the Bible now, what a blessing it is to have the answer to the most important question a person could ask: \u201cWhat must I do to be saved?\u201d \u201cBelieve in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved.\u201d (Acts 16:30-31). We enjoy salvation now through the forgiveness of sins. We will enjoy it forever in the presence of God."}
{"prompt": "Augsburg Confession and free will", "completion": "Is Article XVIII of the Augsburg Confession - about free will - specifically talking about libertarian free will? If so, how is that compatible with divine providence, if no event can occur outside God's control?\n\n\nArticle XVIII addresses the natural condition of people. Conceived and born into this world with a sinful nature, people cannot choose do anything good or godly in the sight of God. People cannot choose to believe in God (John 15:16). Faith is God\u2019s work in the hearts of people (Ephesians 2:8). Only after the Holy Spirit has changed their hearts can Christians do anything to please God (Hebrews 11:6).\nThe free will that people have by nature is limited to the things of this world. Article XVIII provides some examples of the worldly choices people might have.\nCertainly, God is in control of all things (Psalm 2; 47:8; Proverbs 19:21). No one and nothing can thwart God\u2019s purposes. Christians also have God\u2019s promise that he will work for their eventual and eternal good in every situation in life (Romans 8:28)."}
{"prompt": "Photography dilemma", "completion": "If I am a photographer and I was asked to photograph a gay or lesbian wedding, what is the right thing to do?\n\n\nChristians do want to \u201c[speak] the truth in love\u201d (Ephesians 4:15) on all occasions. When it comes to marriage, Christians lovingly share the biblical truth that God designed marriage to be the union of one man and one woman (Genesis 2:22-24; Matthew 19:5,6; Romans 7:2).\nWhat happens to that confession of truth when Christians engage in business transactions with people who define marriage differently? When Christians operate businesses, they interact with and provide services for many different people.\nChristians will want to understand that their transactions with non-Christian churches or individuals are not endorsements of their doctrines or practices. When Christians sell their products to individuals who self-identify with unscriptural practices or ways of living, they are not necessarily approving or sanctioning the actions of their customers. If that were the case, then Christians would need potential customers to fill out an application form so they would not be guilty of doing business with those whose lifestyles or opinions were not Christian.\nBut there may come a time when Christians will refuse to be a partner in what is contrary to the will of God or will bring harm to others. A Christian will consider the role of conscience and will want to refrain from sinning against his or her conscience (Romans 14:23). Deciding what to do is not always easy. Christians will wish to choose opportunities to act as disciples of Jesus and to speak the truth in love, but one size does not fit all situations.\n1 Corinthians 5:12,13 is helpful in providing direction for Christians\u2019 interactions with unbelievers: \u201cWhat business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside? God will judge those outside.\u201d Those words come in the context of the apostle Paul\u2019s directing the Christians in Corinth to take action with a church member who was impenitent over an incestuous relationship. The apostle instructed the Corinthians to implement what Jesus said in Matthew chapter 18: \u201cIf your brother or sister sins . . .\u201d (vv. 15-18). Church discipline involves those within the church. We have no specific instructions from God on addressing personal sins in the lives of those outside the church.\nCertainly, those words from 1 Corinthians chapter 5 do not mean that we close our eyes and ears to what is going on in the world. What those words mean is that the church does not have the responsibility or divine mandate to discipline people who are not part of the church.\nSo, where does this leave us? Yes, we want to love our neighbor, but because there is no manual that spells out in detail how best to live a life of neighborly love, Christians will wrestle with questions like the one you asked. They will seek to arrive at decisions that agree with biblical principles and that do not violate consciences. They will also seek to refrain from judging the motives of fellow Christians who arrive at different decisions."}

{"prompt": "Rapture and animals", "completion": "I\u2019ve been a Christian all my life. I\u2019m currently 16 now and have my heart set on being a veterinarian.  My walk with God has taken a huge hit recently because I found out that my animals are not coming with me in the rapture.  They are left here to suffer the horrible fate of all the unbelievers. It\u2019s a lonely, painful, sad, horrible death and I just don\u2019t see why God would inflict that on a little puppy or even a lion.  God is supposed to be merciful and loving! How is that any of this?  I can\u2019t get over the fact that my poor little maltipoo is going to be left here to die all alone and afraid when I\u2019m taken up. Why would God do that?\n\n\nThere is no need to be concerned about the rapture because the Bible does not teach that. 1 Thessalonians 4:17 (\u201cAfter that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.\u201d) is describing what will take place on the Last Day. The context of that verse is clearly describing events associated with Jesus\u2019 visible return on the Last Day. The Bible does not teach a whisking away of Christians prior to the Last Day.\nWhile God created animals, people are the crown of his creation (Genesis 1 and 2). It is people who have bodies and souls. It is possible that animals will be part of the new heaven and new earth (Revelation 21:1), but Scripture does not explicitly state that.\nI wish you well as you pursue a vocation in veterinary medicine.

{"prompt": "God's forgiveness of sins", "completion": "I'm still having trouble understanding the means of grace concerning the forgiveness of sins. On the cross, Jesus won forgiveness for the world, and so their sins are forgiven them. And in the means of grace, this forgiveness is delivered/conveyed/conferred/ upon us, and we receive it by faith. My question is then, how do we receive forgiveness over and over again? I know that in our Baptism, in Holy Communion, and the Absolution, we receive the forgiveness of sins and that this is more than just mere assurance. Is there any further explanation for this? Or is some of this simple mystery to our human reasoning?\n\n\nYour understanding of the forgiveness of sins, as you explain it in the sentences before your first question, is accurate. God\u2019s declaration of righteousness to all people (John 1:29; Romans 5:18; 2 Corinthians 5:19; 1 John 2:2) became yours personally when the Holy Spirit created saving faith in Jesus in your heart (Romans 3:22, 28; Galatians 3:26-27; Ephesians 2:8-9). God said you were forgiven, and then God gave you the faith to enjoy that forgiveness.\nGod\u2019s forgiveness is complete and total. Through his gospel in word and sacraments, he offers and gives us the forgiveness of sins, life and salvation. In multiple ways \u2014through his word, the sacraments and the Absolution, as you mentioned\u2014God is saying, \u201cI forgive you.\u201d All those pronouncements of forgiveness go back to God\u2019s initial declaration of your righteousness because of Jesus\u2019 holy life, sacrificial death and glorious resurrection.\nThink of a spouse who tells the other spouse often and in different ways, \u201cI love you.\u201d Think of a parent who tells a child often and in different ways, \u201cI love you.\u201d In a much greater way, God tells you and me\u2014often and in different ways\u2014\u201cI love you and I forgive you.\u201d\nI hope this little explanation brings some clarity to and greater appreciation for God\u2019s means of grace."}

Our council closed down Sunday School due to the COVID-19.  With restrictions lifted, they have chosen not to reopen the program for kids due to COVID-19 concerns.  They made allowance for adults through Zoom. The few WELS churches in our area are all partially closed.  Wanting to keep our kids active, we attended a Sunday School at an LCMS congregation that is in a neighboring town.  I think I understand how we broke fellowship, although it was not our intention. We did not fully understand WELS' doctrine on fellowship.  What should be done when churches close or eliminate programs?  When our pastor told us we broke fellowship and exposed ourselves to false doctrine by going to the LCMS church, we were confused on the false doctrine portion as our WELS church uses the same kids' Sunday School curriculum that is published by CPH.\n\n\nCOVID-19 has certainly interrupted our routines in life and congregational life.

You certainly want to speak the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15) to your relative.\nYou can explain that when two people of the opposite sex live together without the benefit of marriage, they put themselves into tempting situations where they can break the sixth commandment. The Bible tells Christians to \u201cflee from sexual immorality\u201d (1 Corinthians 6:18). God explains that he \u201cwill judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral\u201d (Hebrews 13:4).\nIf a man and a woman living together without being married claim to be refraining from sexual activity, they are still in a position of causing offense to others (Matthew 18:6-7) and emboldening them to sin. In addition, their lives are not in line with what God says: that \u201camong you, there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality\u201d (Ephesians 5:3).\nBesides speaking to your relative, continue to include him or her in your prayers.

{"prompt": "Prayer fellowship", "completion": "Concerning prayer with those who are not of the same denomination, I understand the WELS' position on fellowship and prayer. However, is it okay to pray with friends or colleagues who are not WELS members if I am leading the prayer? The same question goes for those who are still unbelievers, but are learning about God.\n\n\nWe are able to pray with people when we enjoy unity in doctrine. I would encourage you to have conversations with your friends or colleagues to compare their beliefs with biblical teachings. With church membership, people commit themselves to the doctrine and practice of their church. Your conversations with your friends or colleagues would likely reveal if they support and uphold false teachings or if the confession of faith they make with their membership and their personal confession of faith are at odds with one another.\nWhen people are not united in doctrine, it does not matter who is leading the prayer. Such prayer is to be avoided. There are exceptions of course.\u00a0 For example, in my own home I can offer table prayers in the presence of others who may or may not join inwardly in what I say.\nYour last scenario is different in that people have not committed themselves to the doctrine and practice of any church. More than that, they are interested in learning what Scripture teaches. Prayer with such people can be done.\nCertainly, we can pray for anyone, and Scripture encourages us to do that (1 Timothy 2:1). Praying with people is a blessing and privilege Christians enjoy when they are united in faith. When people are not united in faith and pray or worship together, they overlook biblical fellowship principles.\nThere is much more than can be said about prayer fellowship.

The book provides detailed information on biology and science, as it presents scriptural teaching.\nBy all means, don\u2019t abandon the Christian faith. Without Jesus, there is nothing. With him, we have everything we could ever want or need. The Holy Spirit creates saving faith in Jesus through the gospel (Romans 10:17). The Spirit uses that same gospel to strengthen and preserve faith. So, use God\u2019s gospel in word and sacrament to stay close to Jesus.\nHebrew 11:3 helps puts Genesis 1 and 2 into perspective: we take God at his word when he tells us how he created all things. God was the only one present at creation. The Bible contains God\u2019s inspired record of how he called all things into existence. To claim a different way in which this world came about is to call God a liar.\n\u201cYour word is truth\u201d (John 17:17). That was Jesus\u2019 assessment of God\u2019s word, the Bible. \u201cTruth\u201d covers every part of the Bible\u2014including the account of creation. You can trust Jesus."}
{"prompt": "Attitudes toward Adam and Eve", "completion": "Is it OK to hate Adam and Eve for ruining everyone's life?\n\n\nNo. We are deceiving ourselves if we think we could have brought about a different outcome in Eden.\nRather than directing a negative emotion at Adam and Eve, we have every reason to direct positive emotions of love and gratitude to God for addressing the sin of Adam and Eve, and providing a Savior in the person of his Son, Jesus Christ."}
{"prompt": "Paradise and heaven", "completion": "When we die, do believers go to Paradise to wait for Christ's second coming in which we will be judged before entering Heaven?\n\n\nParadise is heaven. Think of what Jesus promised the repentant thief on the cross, \u201cTruly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise\u201d (Luke 23:43). When Jesus and the thief died on Good Friday, their bodies and souls separated, their bodies remained on earth and their souls went to heaven.\nWhat the repentant thief experienced was not unique to him. Whenever Christians die, they experience judgment from God and their souls go to heaven (Ecclesiastes 12:7; Hebrews 9:27; Luke 16:22).\nOn the Last Day, those Christians will accompany Jesus as he returns visibly to this world (1 Thessalonians 4:14). The judgment they received at death will be made public, and all those who are alive on the earth at Jesus\u2019 return\u2014and who will not experience death\u2014will be judged at that time (Matthew 25:31-46). And then all Christians will be with the Lord forever (1 Thessalonians 4:17)."}
{"prompt": "Divine council", "completion": "What or who are the divine council, such as in Job and in Psalm 82? Are they angels? Psalm 82 seems to refer to mortal beings in 82:6-7. \n\n\nThe \u201cgreat assembly\u201d of Psalm 82 (verse one) refers to the people of Israel. As Jesus indicated (John 10:34-36) and as Psalm 82 states, the judges and leaders who represented God had the title of \u201cgods.\u201d It is clear from Psalm 82 that God was not pleased with those judges and leaders who were incompetent and corrupt.\nRegarding Job, perhaps you are thinking of chapters one and two, where we hear of angels, including Satan, presenting themselves before the Lord. That would be an assembly in heaven, in the presence of God.\nI hope this is the information you were seeking."}
{"prompt": "Officiate at wedding", "completion": "My son has been asked to perform the wedding for a friend of his. As it is popular to acquire a certificate online to legally become \"ordained\" to do this, our question is where does the synod stand regarding this? Is it acceptable for him to do this for his friend? Thank you.\n\n\nThere is no official synodical position to which I can point you regarding this.\nSince governments regulate marriage, governments also stipulate who can\u2014as agents of the government\u2014officiate at weddings. Regulations vary from state to state. Ordination is not always a requirement. Be aware that online ordination is often a caricature of what ordination into the public ministry really is.\nIf your son were to take the place of an ordained pastor in officiating at the wedding of his friend, I wonder who would provide biblical pre-marital counseling for the prospective bride and groom. That counseling is so very important. Perhaps your pastor can provide guidance in this matter."}
{"prompt": "Celebration of the Lord's Supper", "completion": "Can WELS members give each other Communion?\n\n\nRecent government restrictions on public assemblies\u2014and the size of those assemblies\u2014have led to questions like yours.\nThe following is the response given to an earlier question on the same topic.\n\u201cThe March 24, 2020 Together newsletter addressed Holy Communion practices during this extraordinary time. That information follows:\n\u201cSince restrictions on gatherings vary from place to place, the celebration of the Lord\u2019s Supper will in some places need to be modified, depending on government restrictions and medical guidelines. Some congregations, if allowed by state and local authorities, are gathering in small groups and taking great care to practice good hygiene and recommended \u2018social distancing.\u2019\n\u201cIn other places, even small gatherings are not allowed. There have been questions about how we should proceed when it comes to the celebration of the Lord\u2019s Supper when members cannot gather at church.\n\u201cRegardless of the specific situation in which your congregation finds itself, here are a couple of things to remember. First, while Christians desire to be strengthened and comforted by the Lord\u2019s Supper, we also recognize that there are times when the normal celebration of Communion is not possible. For Christians serving in a war zone, for church members who are in a medically induced coma, for believers who are home-bound because of sickness or infirmity, the normal celebration of the Lord\u2019s Supper with other believers may not be an option. But in those cases we take comfort in knowing that we have the means of grace in two forms\u2014Word and sacrament. The forgiveness conveyed and assured by the written or spoken Word of God is no less powerful and effective than the sacrament. In some cases, private Communion may certainly be available.\n\u201cSecond, we also recognize that there is no scriptural definition or requirement for how frequently Christians should celebrate the Lord\u2019s Supper. Jesus simply encourages us to receive the Lord\u2019s Supper regularly and often. There may be times such as this that, temporarily, the Lord\u2019s Supper may not be available as often as we would like or desire. For that reason, the Conference of Presidents is urging patience with the following advice:\n\u201c\u2019We encourage our congregations at this time to reserve the distribution of the Lord\u2019s Supper for its regular and normal use within the gathering of the body of believers (realizing that some changes in procedure may be made) or distributed privately by the pastor to individuals in need, as is the customary practice. We urge congregations to refrain from initiating novel approaches for celebration of the sacrament.\u2019\n\u201cIf you have specific questions, please contact your district president.\u201d\nClick here to subscribe to Together newsletters."}
{"prompt": "Circumcision today", "completion": "Is circumcision for infant boys biblicaly necessary or optional? Do medical effects have any impact on this choice? Is it purely tradition to circumcise, or why is the U.S. mainly the only country that circumcises and mostly for non-medical traditions? What does the WELS teach parents in this decision making process? Should infant boys be circumcised and why or why not? Thank you for taking the time to answer this question.\n\n\nWhile circumcision was a requirement for God\u2019s Old Testament people of Israel, it is no longer obligatory for followers of God in the New Testament age. The New Testament makes that clear. \u201cCircumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God\u2019s commands is what counts\u201d (1 Corinthians 7:19). \u201cFor in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love\u201d (Galatians 5:6). \u201cNeither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything; what counts is the new creation\u201d (Galatians 6:15). Circumcision was part of God\u2019s Old Testament ceremonial laws.\nCircumcision for health and hygienic reasons today is a parental decision."}
{"prompt": "Dating before finalization of divorce", "completion": "What is the church's stand on dating a person while they are going through a divorce and are members?\n\n\nWhile God established marriage (Genesis 2:18-24; Matthew 19:4-6) and permits divorce for unfaithfulness (Matthew 19:9) and desertion (1 Corinthians 7:15), our government regulates marriage and divorce. Unfaithfulness and desertion can break the bond of marriage, but a dissolution of marriage is required to end the marriage legally.\nIn addition, a person in the situation you described will want to keep in mind how his or her actions can affect others. Entering into a new relationship before the divorce is final could certainly raise questions in people\u2019s minds.\nBecause I do not know the circumstances of the divorce in question, pastoral counseling is certainly appropriate and recommended."}
{"prompt": "Gospel hymn", "completion": "Why are Lutherans opposed to the Gospel hymn \"I Come to the Garden Alone\"?\n\n\nI think you would agree that we want hymns in Lutheran hymnals to present biblical teachings. The hymn in question does not do that.\nStanzas of the hymn use images of nature to describe hearing the voice of the Son of God. The refrain states: \u201cAnd He walks with me, and He talks with me, And He tells me I am his own.\u201d\nThe Bible teaches that God speaks to us through his word. It is through his word that he tells us we are his. \u201cDo not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have summoned you by name; you are mine\u201d (Isaiah 43:1). \u201cSee what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are!\u201d (1 John 3:1)\nBiblically-accurate hymns describe God speaking to people through his word. \u201cGod is speaking by his Spirit, Speaking to the hearts of all, In the ageless Word expounding His own message for us all.\u201d (Christian Worship 281:3) \u201cLord, open now my heart to hear, And through your Word to me draw near.\u201d (Christian Worship 281:1).\nSolid Christian hymns assist us to sing and make music to the Lord (Ephesians 5:19)."}
{"prompt": "Seeking God", "completion": "I am not a believer. I don't have faith, yet I am seeking God.  Does sincerity and willingness to be saved matter to God? What does Isaiah 55:1-6 mean? Does that mean I should hear the Word to be saved? What does seek the Lord mean? I must turn from my sins and believe in Jesus? If I plead, pray, read the Bible, or listen to sermons, is this self-righteousness, and if not, what does Isaiah 55:6 mean?\n\n\nI will put some references to Bible verses in my response to you. I encourage you to look them up.\nWhat matters to God is saving faith in Jesus Christ, his Son. Such faith is God\u2019s gift to people (Ephesians 2:8). The Holy Spirit creates saving faith in people\u2019s hearts through the gospel (Romans 10:17).\nIn Isaiah 55, God invites spiritually thirsty and hungry people to come to him and be satisfied with the news of full and free forgiveness through faith in his Son, Jesus Christ. If people do follow through on that invitation, it is only because the Holy Spirit has worked in their hearts (1 Corinthians 12:3).\nIsaiah 55:6 (\u201cSeek the LORD while he may be found; call on him while he is near.\u201d) underscores the urgency of attending to our spiritual needs. This life is the only time people have to be brought to repentance and faith in Jesus Christ. That is why the Bible says, \u201cNow is the time of God\u2019s favor, now is the day of salvation\u201d (2 Corinthians 6:2). Because we never know when this life will come to an end (Luke 12:13-21), the Bible urges people to tend to their spiritual needs now, today.\nSelf-righteousness is present when people point to their own works or efforts as supposedly being meritorious in God\u2019s sight. The Bible condemns that attitude (Luke 18:9-14). It is definitely not self-righteous for you to \u201cpray, read the Bible, or listen to sermons.\u201d Those are godly and important activities.\nConsidering your circumstances, I believe the materials and resources on WhatAboutJesus would be of great value to you. (The website is maintained by individuals within our church body.) Do check it out. Also, you would benefit by speaking to one of our pastors. To find the closest WELS church to you, consider using this locator tool.\nGod bless you as you explore God\u2019s word and read about God\u2019s great love for you in Jesus, his Son. May God\u2019s Spirit, through the word, fill your heart with Christian faith and confidence."}
{"prompt": "Children's attitudes toward father", "completion": "I\u2018m a single mom that divorced a few years ago. I did not want to divorce but really had no choice in the matter since my spouse had already decided to give up on our marriage, have an affair, and not follow through with marriage counseling with our pastor or therapist. It breaks my heart that I have to allow my children to be exposed to their dad living with his girlfriend, as well as witness negative habits (excessive drinking, angry outbursts w/cursing at the children at times, and not always taking the kids\u2019 needs or feelings into consideration). I have my older children in Christian counseling but having a dad that continues to not be a positive Christian role model takes a toll on these kids.  I\u2019m struggling finding the right Bible passages to help my child cope with having a parent that isn\u2019t necessarily being a Christian role model. I do encourage them to always look to God the Father for hope, unconditional love, and loyalty because He will never let them down and he will always be there for them. I just wish I had more knowledge of verses to use as a reference to find comfort in knowing that parents make mistakes but they can always look to the Lord for everlasting love.   \n\n\nThe Fourth Commandment teaches that God has placed his representatives in the home (Ephesians 6:1-2), the church (Acts 20:28) and the government (Romans 13:1-4). With an eye on the past and the present, it is clear that not all representatives of God represent him faithfully. There are parents\u2014as you indicate\u2014who are not good role models for their children. There are churches that teach false doctrine. There are government officials who are corrupt and even antagonistic toward Christianity.\nWhile not all those people might represent God faithfully, all those individuals are in positions of honor as God\u2019s representatives. Their character and actions might not engender respect and honor but their positions do. That is why, for example, the Bible includes an instruction like this: \u201cSubmit yourselves for the Lord\u2019s sake to every human authority: whether to the emperor, as the supreme authority, or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right\u2026honor the emperor\u201d (1 Peter 2:13-14, 17). The emperor who was in power when Peter wrote those words was Nero\u2014cruel, Christian-hating Nero. By no means did Nero deserve respect or honor because of his sinful actions. On the other hand, Nero occupied a position of honor. He was in that position because of God\u2019s allowance (Romans 13:1-7).\nWe can find similar situations with God\u2019s representatives in the home. A parent might not be deserving of honor because of his or her words, attitudes or actions, but the parent fills an honorable position. For that reason, honor is to be given to that person. The attitude we have toward God\u2019s representatives reflects on our attitude toward God. Certainly, if a parent is guilty of sin, rebuke is appropriate.\nWhen it comes to Bible passages you can share with your children, Hebrews 12:7-11 teaches that God\u2019s \u201cparenting\u201d skills are far superior to those of earthly parents. Psalm 27:10 and Jeremiah 49:15 explain that God\u2019s love for people is constant and faithful, even if parental love is not. Isaiah 54:10 promises God\u2019s firm, unshakeable love for his children.\nBesides reminding your children to continue to pray for their dad, encourage them to be good Christian examples for him. When you and your children let the light of your faith shine (Matthew 5:16), others will see it. God can then be glorified and others may join you in your praise of God.\nGod bless you all."}
{"prompt": "God's communication to people", "completion": "I've been in contact for some time now with a fellow Christian.  He frequently uses phrases like \"the Lord spoke to me\" and \"the Lord put this on my heart.\"  He comes across like he believes he is receiving direct messages from God outside of Scripture.  To me, this doesn't seem to gel with what we read in Hebrews 1:1-2 - \"In the past God spoke to our forefathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he made the universe.\"  I've always understood that passage to mean (and have been taught as such) that we shouldn't expect direct revelation from God anymore, and we should only look to Scripture for God's answers to questions we might have.  What's the best way to respond to someone who insists on saying that \"the Lord spoke to me\" or \"the Lord put this on my heart?\"\n\n\nGod of course can do anything. He can communicate to us any way he wants. The Bible describes instances when God did speak directly to people, through others and in dreams. The fact that God communicated in these ways in the past does not guarantee that God will do so in the future. We have no promise of God communicating to us beyond Scripture.\nHebrews 1:1-2, as you indicated, teaches that we have God\u2019s full communication to us in the pages of the Old and New Testament. There is no need to look elsewhere for communication from God.\nIf there is a \u201cvoice\u201d from God inside us, it is the natural knowledge of his law and a conscience that is guided properly by Holy Scripture. If there is a \u201cvoice\u201d from God inside us, it is the new self\u2014that part of us that is \u201ccreated to be like God in true righteousness and holiness\u201d (Ephesians 4:24)\u2014that desires to live life according to God\u2019s will.\nIt could be that your friend recalls or thinks of Bible verses at times. When he does that, he refers to the Lord speaking to him or putting something on his heart. That \u201cspeaking\u201d is the recollection and application of God\u2019s word.\nYour question is a good reminder that we do well to focus on God\u2019s communication to us through the Bible\u2014and our communication to him in prayer."}
{"prompt": "God's power", "completion": "Can God still do miracles like in the Bible?\n\n\nCertainly.

No one can deliver out of my hand. When I act, who can reverse it?\u201d (Isaiah 43:13) \u201cI am the LORD, the God of all mankind. Is anything too hard for me?\u201d (Jeremiah 32:27) \u201cNow to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever!

{"prompt": "Hiring organists", "completion": "What is the WELS stand on hiring organists from outside of the WELS and ELS to play for worship services?\n\n\nWhen it comes to organists who serve at regular worship services or special worship services, our practice is that those individuals be of our faith and fellowship. Why is that? We want to follow what Scripture says about doctrinal unity and our participation in activities in which we express a common faith (Romans 16:17). We want to send a clear signal that all teachings of the Bible are important (Matthew 28:20). We want to work together with fellow Christians when there really is a common confession of faith (3 John 8).\nI can refer you to the following information from Church Fellowship: Working Together for the Truth. It is available from Northwestern Publishing House.\n\u201cChurch musicians are public representatives of the church, with a prominent public role. They, therefore, should be members of the congregation or its fellowship.\u201d\n\u201cScripture teaches us that only people who agree with the teachings of the church should lead its services. Wouldn\u2019t it be strange if we invited someone who did not agree with our beliefs to speak a message from God\u2019s Word to us? Isn\u2019t it just as strange to invite such a person to sing a message from God\u2019s Word or to remind us of such a message by playing the melodies that bring it to our minds?

The statement included these thoughts: \u201cWe ask God\u2019s forgiveness for our own lack of love and compassion for our neighbors and for taking for granted the peace and freedom that God has provided to us. We ask God to confirm in us the conviction that racism in any form is contrary to the Christian faith and inconsistent with the love that God expects us to have for all.

{"prompt": "Women and voters' assemblies", "completion": "What Scripture is used to deny women's suffrage?  \n\n\nElsewhere on this website you will find This We Believe: A Statement of Belief of the WELS. The \u201cChurch and Ministry\u201d section addresses your question on the basis of Scripture: \u201cWe believe that women may participate in offices and activities of the public ministry except where that work involves authority over men (1 Timothy 2:11,12). This means that women may not serve as pastors nor participate in assemblies of the church in ways that exercise authority over men (1 Corinthians 11:3; 14:33-35).\u201d One of those assemblies is the voters\u2019 assembly.\nDo keep in mind that the relationship between women and voters\u2019 assemblies does not speak to women\u2019s status in God\u2019s sight. Scripture says to Christians: \u201cSo in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.

{"prompt": "The Son of God", "completion": "Why did Jesus have to be a man/male?\n\n\nWithout offering explanation, the Bible calls one person of the Trinity \u201cFather\u201d and another \u201cSon,\u201d and speaks of the Father \u201cbegetting\u201d the Son (Psalm 2:7; Hebrews 1:5).

{"prompt": "Guidance for current events", "completion": "I have not read through all the questions so I'm not sure if this question has been posed yet.  My husband and I are struggling with how to respond to all of the things going on in the world right now.  Covid and Protests and so on.  He thinks it is all political, and what they are telling us is a lot of lies.  He feels we need to stand up for what God would want and not just listen to what the government tells us to do.  I know I am supposed to listen to authority.  I am so confused and need some guidance on all of this.  Can you offer any answers.\n\n\nI don\u2019t know if I can provide any answers, but I will offer some perspective. The Bible tells us that we are living in the last days (Hebrews 1:2). The Bible\u2019s description of the last days is not pretty: \u201cBut mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days. People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God\u2014having a form of godliness but denying its power\u201d (2 Timothy 3:1-5). There is no limit to who might possess those attributes: those who are governed and those who are in positions of governmental authority. Because of the sinful nature in all people, the potential for abusing governmental authority and unlawfully resisting governmental authority is always present.\nMight some people in positions of governmental authority abuse their power? Certainly. History provides plenty of examples of that kind of behavior. Yet, the Bible gives this instruction: \u201cSubmit yourselves for the Lord\u2019s sake to every human authority: whether to the emperor, as the supreme authority, or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right\u2026honor the emperor\u201d (1 Peter 2:13-14, 17). Interestingly enough, the emperor when Peter wrote those words was Nero. He has name recognition with the persecution of Christians. By no means did Nero deserve respect or honor because of his sinful actions. On the other hand, Nero occupied a position of honor. He was in that position because of God\u2019s allowance (Romans 13:1-7).\nToday there might also be individuals in governmental positions whose personal behavior does not generate respect. Still, they fill positions of honor, and we are to render obedience unless their directives conflict with God\u2019s (Acts 5:29).\nThe combination of unfaithful governmental authorities and disobedient citizens can produce chaos in life. As Christians, our comfort is that \u201cOur God is in heaven; he does whatever pleases him\u201d (Psalm 115:3). God will carry out his will in spite of powerful or weak people who oppose him (Psalm 2:1-4). As Christians, our comfort is that God is working in history for the good of his Church (Romans 8:28).\nSo, where does this leave us? As Christians, we recognize that God\u2019s Fourth Commandment requires our obedience toward his representatives in the government\u2014as well as in the home and the church. We acknowledge that God\u2019s representatives are imperfect, as are the people they serve. We see the need for praying for governmental authorities at all levels. We realize that we can voice our concerns to governmental authorities, seeking change in laws and policies.\nThe Bible reminds you and me: \u201cFor here we do not have an enduring city, but we are looking for the city that is to come\u201d (Hebrews 13:14). With all that has happened so far this year, I think we would agree that it is a good thing this world is not our permanent residence. We look forward to a perfect and glorious eternity with our Savior-God. For that reason, Christians throughout the ages have said, \u201cAmen. Come, Lord Jesus\u201d (Revelation 22:20)."}
{"prompt": "Ancient creeds", "completion": "Who wrote the Apostles' Creed and the Nicene Creed and why?\n\n\nBecause the wording of the Apostles\u2019 Creed developed over several hundred years, its authorship is unknown. It is clear that the apostles did not write the creed. Rather, the creed expresses the biblical teachings of the apostles. The Apostles\u2019 Creed offers a simple summary of the Christian faith. For that reason, it has a long history of being associated with Baptism and instruction in God\u2019s word.\nThe Nicene Creed was the result of a church council that met in Nicea in 325 A.D. The Second Article of the Creed is much longer than that of the Apostles\u2019 Creed because the council was addressing false doctrines about the person of Jesus Christ."}
{"prompt": "Immigration", "completion": "I would like to know what is the church\u2019s position on immigration? Many people use Leviticus 19:34 as a justification for immigration. What is the church\u2019s position on it?\n\n\nThere is no official church position on immigration to which I can point you.\nLeviticus 19:34 is part of the civil law code that governed the Old Testament people of Israel. As New Testament followers of the Lord, God\u2019s moral law to love all people is applicable to our lives today. We see that directive to love all people reflected in Jesus\u2019 teachings (Matthew 22:37-39; Luke 10:25-37).\nYou might be interested to know that German immigrants were a vital part of the origin of our church body in 1850. That historical background can help explain the lack of an official position on the subject of immigration."}
{"prompt": "Pastor and Lord's Supper", "completion": "Does a pastor have to do the Lord's Supper?

{"prompt": "Praying for friends and family", "completion": "Is it alright to pray for friends or family whose religions are different from yours? Thanks.\n\n\nCertainly. We can pray for anyone. In fact, Scripture directs us to do that (1 Timothy 2:1). Biblical fellowship principles enter the picture when it comes to praying with others.\nSo, do pray for friends and family. When it comes to their spiritual lives and the spiritual lives of others, you can follow the example of the apostle Paul and pray that the eyes of their hearts may be enlightened (Ephesians 1:18)."}
{"prompt": "Military honors at church funeral", "completion": "Are full military honors, including the gun salute, allowed at a WELS funeral held at the church?\n\n\nI contacted our synod\u2019s national civilian chaplain and liaison to the military. He provided the following information.\nThe policy of the U.S. Armed Forces is to acknowledge that the control of the funeral and graveside services for a fallen active duty warrior lies with the officiant chosen by the family. In most cases, this means the pastor. The pastor may accept or decline whatever the Armed Forces offers. His decision will not be challenged.\nAllowing some military presence is not necessarily mixing the roles of Church and State. As with having an American flag in the church, some presence of the American Military merely reflects the fact that government has been established by the Lord of the Church and is given as his blessing.\nThe amount of military presence should be determined by the pastor\u2019s judgment of what would be God-pleasing under the circumstances.\nThe branch of the Armed Forces that the person was a member of will offer a number of military honors. They may include an honor guard, the presentation of the American flag to a family member \u201cOn behalf of a grateful nation,\u201d firing a gun salute, a missing-man flyover and the playing of Taps. The honor guard may be available to carry or escort the casket from the funeral home to the church and then to the cemetery. All of this, or only pieces of this, may be offered by the military.\nSome of this can take place outside of the religious setting, perhaps at the funeral home.\nThe pastor can choose to accept, or not accept, the offer of remarks by a military representative in the church following the funeral service.\nThe family will probably indicate a preference for what the military offers, but the officiant has the final say on what happens at the funeral and graveside service. The family may choose what will happen at the funeral home (as long as it is not during the funeral service held there). For a high-ranking officer, or the recipient of a medal of valor, the honor guard might be offered to stand near the casket during visitation.\nIf the pastor does not agree to a gun salute in connection with his graveside service, the family may request it to take place after the pastor finishes his service. That request will most likely be granted.\nThe bottom line is that the pastor is in control of the funeral and graveside service. The military will offer, but not demand, some degree of presence to show the appreciation by the nation. Whatever takes place before or after the funeral and graveside service is beyond the pastor\u2019s control. That is determined by the family."}
{"prompt": "Order of creation", "completion": "What is meant by the term \"order of creation\"/\"God's created order\"? Could you please provide a brief definition? (I'm referring to the order of relationships.)\n\n\nThe term describes the well-ordered way that God has designed everything in his creation to proclaim his love and faithfulness by who they are or by what they do or say. One part of that order of creation is the interdependent partnership of men and women as they function in relationship with each other as head and helper.\nThe following excerpts from Man and Woman Roles provide more detail:\n1. God created man and woman in His own image. The divine image gave man and woman spiritual equality in their relationship to the Creator (Ge 1:26,27; Col 3:10; Gal 3:28).\n2. In love God established distinct male and female responsibilities (Ge 2:7,18,22) for the man and woman to whom He had given spiritual equality. These responsibilities involved headship for man and submission for woman. These roles demonstrated God\u2019s unchanging will for the complementary relationship of man and woman with each other. Two New Testament passages attest to this: 1 Co 11:3,8,9 and 1 Ti 2:12,13.\n3. God established roles for man and woman in His creative plan before He united them in marriage and before they fell into sin (Ge 2:7,18,22; 1 Co 11:3,8,9). Therefore God\u2019s assigned roles apply beyond the marriage relationship and in every period of history."}
{"prompt": "Flags in churches", "completion": "What is the correct protocol for the display of the Christian flag and American flag in our church?\n\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that we are dealing an adiaphoron here: something that God has neither commanded nor forbidden. Christians thus have freedom to display or not display flags in their churches.\nIf a church is going to display flags (an American and a church flag) in the chancel, they would probably cause the least confusion by following the Flag Code guidelines. Those guidelines state: \u201cWhen used on a speaker\u2019s platform, the flag, if displayed flat, should be displayed above and behind the speaker. When displayed from a staff in a church or public auditorium, the flag of the United States of America should hold the position of superior prominence, in advance of the audience, and in the position of honor at the clergyman\u2019s or speaker\u2019s right as he faces the audience. Any other flag so displayed should be placed on the left of the clergyman or speaker or to the right of the audience.\u201d\nIf a church is not going to display flags, they would have reason for doing so. In that regard, let me pass along information from Christian Worship: Manual, the companion book to Christian Worship: A Lutheran Hymnal. In the chapter titled \u201cThe Worship Space,\u201d there is this guidance: \u201cSome churches like to include the national, Christian, and denominational flags in the chancel. While many Lutheran congregations have displayed flags of one sort or another, building committees ought to carefully analyze this tradition. Altar, pulpit, and font \u2018all point to Christ,\u2019 while national flags \u2018speak not of Christ, but of the nation\u2019 [Brugginck and Droppers, Christ and Architecture, pp. 250ff]. Especially in an age when so many Christian churches confuse the separate roles of church and state, it may be wise to place national flags in the narthex rather than in the chancel. The use of the Christian flag may promote an imprecise view of the church and false ecumenism besides. Denominational loyalty is important in a congregation, but recent history seems to indicate that it is better to teach loyalty to the Scriptures that cannot err than to denominations that can. The important work of the church body can surely be emphasized in better ways than with a flag\u201d (pp. 85-86).\nAgain, because this is a matter on which Scripture is silent, congregations do well to explain clearly their rationale for whatever their particular practice in this area might be."}

{"prompt": "Alzheimer's and Holy Communion", "completion": "Is it right for a person with Alzheimer's to take Communion if they don't often know their spouse or where they live?  They seem to be mentally lost most the time. \n\n\nSome time ago, a person asked a similar question. Here is the question and answer that became an article in Forward in Christ.\n\u201cDementia leads my elderly father to speak like he has lost his faith. To make matters worse, our pastor will not give him Communion. What am I to think?\u201d\nLike you, I\u2019m saddened when anyone loses physical or mental abilities, especially when it is a family member. God\u2019s design was that we have perfect bodies and minds here on earth, but sin\u2019s entrance into the world introduced physical and mental suffering and, ultimately, death. You asked what you are to think of your father\u2019s current situation. Here is what I would encourage you to think about.\nFaith is a matter of the heart\nWhile a book of the Bible like James teaches us that Christian faith is living and active (James 2:17), visible and audible in daily living, we want to keep in mind that faith is a matter of the heart. Faith is trusting in Jesus Christ as the Savior from one\u2019s sin. The fact that your father cannot always express Christian faith does not mean that faith has vanished. I would liken his situation to a child.\nWas your father baptized as an infant? Were you? I was. Could any of us right after Baptism express with our mouths the Christian faith the Holy Spirit planted in our hearts? No. The physical and mental abilities to do that had not yet developed. Still, the inability to confess Christian faith with the mouth at that young age did not mean faith was absent. Adults like your father can be in a similar situation at the other end of the age scale; diminished physical and mental capabilities can make it difficult for him to confess Christian faith consistently.\nSo is there a way to nurture and preserve his faith? That\u2019s where your second question comes in.\nThe Word of God is powerful\nWhile it is certainly understandable that you would like your father to receive Holy Communion\u2014and your pastor shares that attitude\u2014we want to remember what God says about the distribution and reception of the Lord\u2019s Supper.\nScripture instructs us that \u201ca man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup\u201d (1 Corinthians 11:28). God requires that people who desire to receive Communion examine their hearts beforehand. A proper examination leads to a confession of sins and a confession that Jesus gives his very body and blood in the Sacrament for the forgiveness of sins. The very young are not able to make this kind of examination and confession, and so we do not commune them until they can. In other cases, such as your father\u2019s, waning mental capabilities may prevent Christians, periodically or continually, from examining themselves or expressing the results of an examination of the heart. In those instances, pastors have to make a judgment call and withhold Communion. And while family members like you can be frustrated about such a decision, I also can assure you that pastors are saddened to arrive at that course of action.\nAll this does not mean that your father is cut off from the means that will strengthen and preserve his faith. The simple spoken Word of God can penetrate his heart. When your pastor speaks God\u2019s Word to your father and points him to the cross and the empty tomb, the Holy Spirit uses that Word to deepen and sustain faith. The Word is that powerful (Romans 1:16). Praise God for that power\u2014and his promise to perfect our bodies and minds on the Last Day!"}
{"prompt": "Current events", "completion": "So far, throughout this pandemic and civil unrest, I have not heard our churches or synod call for its members to appeal for God's mercy to take this virus away by:  petitioning God through daily prayer and repentance, and even fasting.  There have been no special services on-line or in person to address this current horrendous situation.   I am sure many Christians are doing this on their own at home, but where is the leadership?  We have sermons and services on-line, but very few prayers re: Covid-19.   This is very troublesome to me.     Because I do not usually go to the WELS website, I may have missed something.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\nIf you do not usually visit the WELS website, then you have missed devotions and prayers that have addressed contemporary issues. Let me provide a few examples.\nAlready back on March 16, 2020, the WELS Together newsletter listed spiritual resources that individuals could use in their personal lives.\nThe website offers numerous devotions for individuals and families. This devotion from April 20, 2020 addressed the fears that can accompany a pandemic.\nYou will find prayers on the website that cover a wide variety of circumstances in life. The prayer titled \u201cIn Time of Need\u201d speaks to today\u2019s concerns.\nYour concern for emphasizing repentance is definitely appropriate. Jesus spoke of the importance of repentance (Luke 13:1-5). Repentance is not to be a seasonal or occasional activity. It is ongoing. Martin Luther recognized that when he wrote in the first of his 95 Theses: \u201cWhen our Lord and Master Jesus Christ said, \u2018Repent\u2019 (Matthew 4:17), he willed the entire life of believers to be one of repentance.\u201d\nFinally, I do not know if you are aware of WELS\u2019 presence on Facebook. This is a prayer that was posted on May 25, 2020: \u201cAlmighty Father, strong to save, we pray that you would look upon America in mercy. We confess our shortcomings as a nation and our failures as a people.\nThe fault lies not only with some who have no regard for you. We, your very own people, share the blame for thoughts and actions that violate your code of conduct. And yet, you have not abandoned us. Your Word still echoes across our land. We still have the freedom to worship you in spirit and in truth. We pray that you continue to allow us to bask in the splendor of your Word. You have visited our nation and our world with a virus that causes alarm and death.\nWe add this to the list of reasons why we need to remember that apart from you is neither hope nor life. This is a day on which we remember loss. This is a day when we remember you as the one who restores blessings that have been lost. As we consider the long list of people who have lost their lives in defense of our country, we thank you that they have not died in vain.\nYou have blessed their efforts to keep us as a free nation. Now bless us with your continued presence as we strive to serve you in this freedom. For the sake of your Son, bless all those who serve you by serving our country. Amen.\u201d"}

{"prompt": "Numbering of Ten Commandments", "completion": "I\u2019ve always wondered why Luther restructured the Ten Commandments by getting rid of the Second Commandment and splitting the Tenth into two nearly identical commandments. I would appreciate your thoughts on this. \n\n\nThe \u201cTen Commandments\u201d of Exodus 34:28 is literally \u201cten words\u201d in Hebrew. Because the Bible does not enumerate the ten words, people have assigned different numerical values to them. That explains the three systems of numbering the Ten Commandments that have long existed.\nMartin Luther did not restructure the Ten Commandments; he simply retained the numbering system of the Roman Catholic Church.\nA second system that most Protestant churches use splits the First Commandment into two commandments and contains one commandment on coveting.\nA third system frames the first \u201cword\u201d as an introduction: \u201cI am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery\u201d (Exodus 20:2). There is then one commandment on idolatry and one commandment on coveting.\nNone of the numbering systems omit the content of the Ten Commandments. The systems simply arrange the content differently."}
{"prompt": "Confession of sins to God and people", "completion": "If I no longer have contact with someone I\u2019ve wronged in the past and later in life realize I was wrong, and repent to God for it, is that enough for forgiveness and salvation? I know that it would be the loving thing to do to reach out to that person and confess, but if I choose not to contact the person and just repent to God for my sin against that person, am I still forgiven?\n\n\nForgiveness of sins comes from God. By his holy life and sacrificial death, Jesus Christ won forgiveness of sins for you. His glorious resurrection guarantees it. The message of the Bible is that \u201cIf we confess our sins, he [God] is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness\u201d (1 John 1:9).\nSince forgiveness of sins comes from God, confessing sins to God is not optional for Christians. Your confession to God about the person you sinned against was important and meaningful; you enjoy God\u2019s forgiveness.\nAt the same time, I would also want you to remember this instruction from the Bible: \u201cTherefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed\u201d (James 5:16). If you know \u201cit would be the loving thing to do to reach out to that person and confess\u201d but don\u2019t, I would encourage you to make sure you are not harboring any ill will toward that person. Such attitudes are spiritually dangerous (Matthew 6:15).\nAs difficult as it might be to confess your sins to the person you wronged, doing so would enable that individual to offer his or her forgiveness. In addition, doing so could bring about closure to past situations. I have to wonder how long you might hang on to the memory of the past if you do not speak to the person you wronged.\nI wish you well and pray for God\u2019s peace in your life."}
{"prompt": "Marriage and divorce", "completion": "I know divorce is allowed if there is adultery. I was wondering in that instance, is only the \"innocent\" spouse allowed to file for divorce? Or can the adulterous spouse file for divorce as well? Thank you for your time.\n\n\nThe spouse who committed adultery has already sinned against God and the other spouse. Repentance is the course of action for that person (Mark 1:15; Luke 13:3; Acts 17:30).\nAs far as state laws are concerned, filing for divorce is an option for the spouse who committed adultery. When it comes to that spouse\u2019s spiritual life, however, that course of action would only be making matters worse.\nThe situation you describe certainly calls for pastoral counseling for the couple in question."}
{"prompt": "Angels speaking", "completion": "Is it correct or incorrect to believe that an angel has spoken audibly to a person in our present age?\n\n\nIt is possible for what you asked to take place in life today. God can do anything; we cannot limit his abilities.\nThe Bible even provides this instruction: \u201cDo not forget to show hospitality to strangers, for by so doing some people have shown hospitality to angels without knowing it\u201d (Hebrews 13:2). Abraham was such an individual (Genesis 18)."}
{"prompt": "School dress code", "completion": "How does the WELS school community define 'modesty' with regard to school dress? Our school used to have a standard length to the top of the knee but now believes teaching Christian freedom and defining the standard as modest is all that is needed. What does modest mean? Do we define it based on current styles and norms?\n\n\nModesty is defined as \u201cpropriety in dress, speech or conduct\u201d and \u201cregard for decency of behavior, speech, dress, etc.\u201d The WELS school community takes a definition like that and applies it in a Christian setting.\nBecause the WELS school community is large (2019 statistics: 372 early childhood ministries, 289 elementary schools, 25 area Lutheran high schools, two preparatory schools, a college and a seminary), one would expect to find differing applications of the definition of \u201cmodesty.\u201d There is no detailed standard to which all students of all schools must comply. Such an approach would be legalistic.\nIf your school has changed its dress code policy, you will want to contact your school\u2019s principal to pass along your thoughts and receive answers to your questions.\nWithout question, Christians of all ages will want to \u201cdo all to the glory of God\u201d (1 Corinthians 10:31). That includes how they dress and conduct themselves. Dress and behavior are, after all, ways of letting our light shine (Matthew 5:16)."}
{"prompt": "Biblical teaching and salvation", "completion": "Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nAlthough you have many answers to many questions regarding Roman Catholicism, I would like some clarification. Will a devout Roman Catholic, who accepts the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church (such as the Council of Trent, the veneration of the saints, etc.) and who remains faithful to those teachings to death, be saved? (If \"will\" is too strong, \"can\" is a fine substitute.) \r\n\r\nIf the answer is not a clear yes, are some doctrines more damnable than others?\r\n\r\nThank you.\n\n\nIn This We Believe, a statement of belief of our church body, we confess this:\n\u201c1. We believe that there is one holy Christian church, which is the temple of God (1 Corinthians 3:16) and the body of Christ (Ephesians 1:23; 4:12). The members of this one church are all those who are the \u2018sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus\u2019 (Galatians 3:26). The church, then, consists only of believers, or saints, whom God accepts as holy for the sake of Jesus\u2019 righteousness, which has been credited to them (2 Corinthians 5:21). These saints are scattered throughout the world. All people who believe that Jesus is their Savior from sin are members of the holy Christian church, regardless of the nation, race, or church body to which they belong.\n\u201c2. We believe that this holy Christian church is a reality, although it is not an external, visible organization. Because \u2018man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart\u2019 (1 Samuel 16:7), only the Lord knows \u2018those who are his\u2019 (2 Timothy 2:19). The members of the holy Christian church are known only to God; we cannot distinguish between true believers and hypocrites. The holy Christian church is therefore invisible and cannot be identified with any one church body or with the total membership of all church bodies.\n\u201c3. We believe that the presence of the holy Christian church nevertheless can be recognized. Wherever the gospel is preached and the sacraments are administered, the holy Christian church is present, for through the means of grace true faith is produced and preserved (Isaiah 55:10,11). The means of grace, therefore, are called the marks of the church.\u201d\nThose statements make clear that salvation is not limited to a particular visible church body.\nSince the Bible teaches that faith in Jesus Christ alone, apart from works, saves (Romans 3:20, 28; Galatians 2:15-26; Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:4-7), Roman Catholic Church members will need to ignore official teachings of their church and trust only in Christ for salvation. Their church, after all, condemns anyone who teaches the biblical truth that faith in Jesus alone saves. The following quotations from the Council of Trent (Sixth Session) illustrate that.\n\u201cCANON IX.-If any one saith, that by faith alone the impious is justified; in such wise as to mean, that nothing else is required to co-operate in order to the obtaining the grace of Justification, and that it is not in any way necessary, that he be prepared and disposed by the movement of his own will; let him be anathema.\n\u201cCANON XI.-If any one saith, that men are justified, either by the sole imputation of the justice of Christ, or by the sole remission of sins, to the exclusion of the grace and the charity which is poured forth in their hearts by the Holy Ghost, and is inherent in them; or even that the grace, whereby we are justified, is only the favour of God; let him be anathema.\n\u201cCANON XII.-If any one saith, that justifying faith is nothing else but confidence in the divine mercy which remits sins for Christ\u2019s sake; or, that this confidence alone is that whereby we are justified; let him be anathema.\u201d\nThe book of Galatians emphasizes the truth that people jeopardize their salvation if they add anything to Jesus\u2019 work as the reason for their salvation. That is an important message\u2014not just for members of the church you referenced but all people.\nAll false doctrine is serious and threatening to saving faith. It may not be popular to point out false doctrine today, but Christians will do that if they care about the eternal welfare of others.\nI hope this response has answered your questions satisfactorily."}
{"prompt": "Church and pastor", "completion": "I am currently attending a Presbyterian church in California.  I was surprised when a female gave a sermon there, and does so from time to time.  She is classified as a Minister of Member Care.  I always thought and believed this went against the Bible.  Yet, their website defends the practice of women ministers.  I'm sure you're aware of the Bible passages used by people to justify this.  My concern is, am I sinning by attending this church?  Why is there a dispute about the Bible's clarity on this?  Are the flock of this church condemned to hell because of this practice?  Thanks.  This is really bothering me.\n\n\nWith the situation you describe, the word of God might be proclaimed, but it is done so illegitimately\u2014contrary to the will of God. Those who are supporting a ministry like that are supporting its illegitimacy.\nThe Bible is clear about the service of women in the public ministry and the limitations of such service when it involves authority over men (1 Corinthians 11:3; 14:33-35; 1 Timothy 2:11-12). Disputes over the Bible\u2019s teaching result when people fail to let Scripture speak for itself and interpret itself.\nActing contrary to God\u2019s will is serious. The Bible warns that even a \u201clittle\u201d false teaching can grow into more and more serious problems (Galatians 5:9).\nBecause you indicated you were bothered by your present circumstances, I would encourage you to make appropriate changes in your worship life. You want to act in faith and not with doubt (Romans 14:23).\nThe WELS locator can help you find one of our churches in your area, if you are interested in that. God\u2019s blessings to you."}

The Hebrew word in the Fifth Commandment (Exodus 20:13 and Deuteronomy 5:17) prohibits murder\u2014the illegal and inappropriate taking of human life\u2014and does not forbid all taking of life.

That judgment provides entrance into heaven for the souls of believers, while the souls of unbelievers are condemned to hell.\nOn the Last Day, there will be judgment of those who are alive on the earth. There will also be public proclamation of the judgments that took place when people died (Matthew 25:31-46)."}
{"prompt": "\"Soul of Christ\" prayer", "completion": "I have a question concerning the ESV version of the Bible published by Concordia Publishing House.  In the prayers section at the end there is a prayer called \"Soul of Christ.\" It was written by Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Jesuits.  The prayer starts, \"Soul of Christ sanctify me.\"  What is the meaning of this? Doesn't the Spirit sanctify using the means of grace?  My pastor thought the term \"Soul of Christ\" a bit \"Romish\" and confusing. Better to start such a prayer with \"Holy Spirit sanctify me,\" or \"Spirit of God sanctify me.\"  Your comment.\r\n\n\n\nThe prayer has been attributed to Iganatius of Loyola, but it appears to have been written well before the lifetime of Ignatius. The prayer has a long history of usage by Roman Catholic Church members in connection with their daily Mass. Phrases in the prayer highlight the suffering and death of Jesus Christ, the Son of God who took on human flesh.\nWhen it comes to the Triune God\u2019s actions toward the world and the people of the world, specific acts are ascribed especially to each person of the Trinity: Father, creation; Son, redemption; Holy Spirit, sanctification.\nSanctification means to \u201cset apart.\u201d In the wider sense of the word, the Holy Spirit sanctifies people when he calls them out of the unbelieving world to be holy people in God\u2019s sight through Spirit-given faith (1 Corinthians 6:11). In the narrower sense of the word, the Holy Spirit sanctifies Christians by leading them to detest sin and live life God\u2019s way (Psalm 119:104, 112). As you noted, the Holy Spirit sanctifies people through the means of grace.\nWhile the work of sanctification is especially ascribed to the Holy Spirit, it is not surprising to read that the Bible also speaks of Jesus\u2019 role in sanctification (Hebrews 2:11). We find something similar when the Bible teaches Jesus\u2019 involvement in creation (John 1:1-3)\u2014a work that is especially ascribed to God the Father.\nI understand the confusion that can result with a prayer that begins \u201cSoul of Christ, sanctify me\u2026\u201d Lutheran worshipers appreciate the clarity and comfort of a prayer like this: \u201cO Holy Spirit, come to me with your comforting Word, which alone can drive away my doubts. Direct me to my Savior, Jesus, that I may trust in him with my whole heart. Amen.\u201d (Christian Worship: A Lutheran Hymnal, page 134)"}
{"prompt": "Knowing others in heaven", "completion": "Will we know each other in heaven?\n\n\nAt death, body and soul separate (Ecclesiastes 12:7). On the Last Day, the Lord will raise the bodies of all who died and reunite bodies and souls (John 5:28-29). In the case of Christians, God will glorify their bodies and remove any deficiencies caused by the existence of sin in the world (Philippians 3:21). We will certainly be recognizable to one another.\n1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 speaks of the Lord gathering together his followers, never to be separated again."}
{"prompt": "Broken promises", "completion": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am plagued with fear of death and hell. It stems from reminders of times when I attempted to bargain with God to not allow me into heaven or have the blood of Jesus cleanse me if I committed a particular sin again. I know this was wrong in trying to use fear to help me overcome. I also bargained that the devil could stop me being saved if I committed a specific sin again. It sounds crazy but I got so trapped into the habit of this. I want to believe that I can still be saved and continue the walk with Jesus I started as a young child. I am now an adult and want to be free from this terrible doubt that assails my mind. The fear is that God gave me a free will and that I will be held to what I \u201cvowed.\u201d \r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n\n\n\nI want to assure you that your struggle against temptation and sin is not unique. The apostle Paul spoke for every Christian when he described the struggle between the old self and the new self (Romans 7:15-25). Paul lamented how, time and again, he failed to live according to God\u2019s will. It got to the point where Paul asked, \u201cWho will rescue me from this body that is subject to death?\u201d (Verse 24) The apostle answered his question in the next verse: \u201cThanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord!\u201d\nLike you, other Christians have made serious vows and promises to the Lord\u2014and broke them. On the night before he was crucified, Jesus warned his disciples: \u201cThis very night you will all fall away on account of me\u201d (Matthew 26:31). The apostle Peter promised, \u201cEven if all fall away on account of you, I never will\u201d (Matthew 26:33). When Jesus then told Peter that he would disown him three times before the rooster crowed, Peter promised, \u201cEven if I have to die with you, I will never disown you\u201d (Matthew 26:35). Peter was not alone in making that promise\u2014\u201dAnd all the other disciples said the same\u201d (Matthew 26:35).\nPeter and his fellow disciples made a serious promise to the Lord, and they broke it. How did they recover from that failure? The message of the Bible is this: \u201cIf we confess our sins, he [God] is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness\u201d (1 John 1:9). The risen Lord assured his disciples of their forgiveness when he said to them more than once, \u201cPeace be with you!\u201d (John 20:19)\nYou can address the \u201cvows\u201d you made in the past through confession and absolution. When you confess your wrong words and actions to the Lord, you can be sure that he hears and acts. Through the gospel in word and sacrament the Lord offers and gives you the forgiveness of sins. Through that same gospel the Lord speaks about delivering us from the fear of death (Hebrews 2:14-15).\nWhen it comes to battling sin and temptation in the future, I encourage you to look to God and his promises. His promises never fail; he carries out what he has vowed. God provides strength for Christian living by means of his gospel in word and sacrament.\nGod bless you with the peace of forgiveness!"}
{"prompt": "Martin Luther and Jews", "completion": "Has our synod apologized for the anti-Semitic statements made by Martin Luther?\n\n\nI can refer you to a column that appeared in the October 2013 Forward in Christ:\n\u201cPerhaps uninformed people really think that Lutherans idolize or inappropriately revere Luther. We can assure them we don\u2019t. Rather, we cherish and thankfully embrace key concepts that God restored to their rightful place in the church through Martin Luther. By grace alone, through faith alone, by Scripture alone, and through Christ alone are truths the Reformer championed. Highlight these truths for your friend. This is what true Lutheranism is all about.\n\u201cLutherans have never believed or taught everything Luther said or wrote was correct. Luther said and wrote some things that would have better remained unspoken and unwritten. This should not be surprising when one considers how much he wrote. Let\u2019s be quick to cherish divine truths given renewed prominence through Luther and equally swift to acknowledge the man\u2019s imperfections.\n\u201cAccusations of anti-Semitism against Luther usually stem from reading his 1543 tract On the Jews and Their Lies, in which the Reformer used immoderate language and gave questionable counsel on how to deal with Jews at that time. While we have never endorsed what and how he wrote in that treatise, we also believe a fair, historically-sensitive appraisal of the man and his message will show the Reformer was not anti-Semitic. Excellent books have been written on this topic, but here we must limit ourselves to these brief points:\n\u201c Luther also wrote about Jews in sympathetic ways and rebuked European Christians for their treatment of Jews. Here\u2019s one example: \u2018The fury of some Christians (if they are to be called Christians) is damnable. They imagine that they are doing God a service when they persecute the Jew most hatefully, think everything evil of them, and insult them. . . . Whereas, according to the example of this psalm (14:7) and that of Paul (Romans 9:1), a man ought to be most heartily sorry for them and continually pray for them. . . . They ought to attract them by all manner of gentleness, patience, pleading and care\u2019 (What Luther Says: An Anthology, Vol. 2, 683).\n\u201c Luther\u2019s attitude is more accurately characterized as anti-Judaism rather than anti-Semitism. His opposition was not racial or ethnic, but theological. He was targeting people who persistently and vigorously rejected the truth of salvation through faith alone in Jesus the Messiah and Savior of the world. Luther wrote harshly against the Roman pope and his theological supporters for the same reason.\n\u201c Like everyone else, Luther was a child of his times. It\u2019s difficult for people today to put themselves into his historical context, yet it\u2019s unfair to judge him according to our standards of civility. Luther\u2019s language sounds cruel, but his opponents often used similar language, and literary style of the era included harsh ridicule, name calling, and deliberate excess.\n\u201cUltimately we must conclude that the treatise in question doesn\u2019t represent Luther at his best. We cannot endorse or excuse what he wrote. From a historical viewpoint, it should not surprise us that he sometimes shared unacceptable attitudes of his day. What is amazing is how often he rose above his times and advocated magnificent and eternal truth, most of all the full and free gospel of forgiveness.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "God's communication", "completion": "Does God ever on any occasion talk to his children through dreams?\r\n\n\n\nA recent questioner asked a question very similar to yours. What follows is the response that was given.\nGod of course can do anything. He can communicate to us any way he chooses. The Bible describes instances when God did speak directly to people, through others and in dreams. The fact that God communicated in these ways in the past does not guarantee that God will do so in the future.\nWhat the Bible does say is that \u201cIn the past God spoke to our forefathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son\u2026\u201d (Hebrews 1:1-2). We have God\u2019s full communication to us in the pages of the Old and New Testament. There is no need to look elsewhere for communication from God. In addition, God tells us that dreams can actually be a tool of people who want to mislead and deceive us (Jeremiah 23:25-28).\nWe have no promise of God that he will communicate to us beyond Scripture. So, we do well to focus on God\u2019s communication to us through the Bible and our communication to him in prayer."}
{"prompt": "Reality shifting", "completion": "Recently I stumbled along this thing called \"reality shifting.\"  It\u2019s basically where you write a script and meditate so that you can shift realities and live in your desired reality. I kind of wanted to try this out, but before I do I wanted to know if it sounds like a sin.  If it is a sin, I obviously won\u2019t do it.\n\n\nFrom what I know about the subject, it does not sound like a sin but rather a vain attempt to escape one\u2019s present reality.\nThere are certainly some positive changes in life over which we might have control. Other positive changes may be out entirely out of our control. What do we do then? Do we pretend our present reality does not exist and imagine ourselves in a better situation in life? That sounds a lot like self-deception.\nI think of 1 Corinthians 7:21, where the apostle Paul addressed the reality that some of his first readers were enslaved. Those people might have arrived at that reality because of debt, the outcome of war or an agreement to survive. What instruction did the Lord\u2019s apostle have for those individuals? \u201cDon\u2019t let it trouble you\u2014although if you can gain your freedom, do so.\u201d Imagining that life was different and better would not have changed the situation of those people. Living with the present reality with godly attitudes or working to change their circumstances in life were realistic options; \u201creality shifting\u201d would not have helped them.\nWhen it comes to our spiritual lives, we can\u2019t change the reality of our natural sinful condition and our actual sins. Those are real, and we confess them to God (Psalm 51:1-5). God\u2019s forgiveness of our sins is also real, and we praise him for blotting our sins from his memory (Isaiah 43:25). The promise of a perfect, glorious eternity with God is also real (John 14:2-3).\nNo amount of reality shifting will remove life\u2019s problems for Christians. Jesus provided this dose of reality: \u201cIn this world you will have trouble\u201d (John 16:33). Thankfully, Jesus went on to say,\u201d But take heart! I have overcome the world.\u201d Apart from our almighty God and his powerful word, people are left to devise solutions for their problems and unwanted circumstances. It is no surprise those solutions fail. With God and his powerful word, however, Christians can be content with their present circumstances (Philippians 4:11-12). I encourage you to stick with God and his word."}
{"prompt": "Divorce and remarriage", "completion": "Is it a sin for a person long divorced to remarry? I'm just curious. My friend says it is adultery to remarry after divorce even if you divorced from a cheater. She also said it is sinful for a divorced couple to remarry. I think she is only going off of the Old Testament and is legalistic.\n\n\nQuestions like this are best answered by parish pastors who know more details of the individuals involved than I do.\nWhat I can say in a general way is that a Christian whose marriage was broken by the unfaithfulness of the other spouse, and divorce took place, is not forbidden to remarry."}
{"prompt": "WELS and Presbyterian Church", "completion": "What are the differences between WELS and the Presbyterian Church?\n\n\nI can point you to the answer of a very similar question. The answer follows.\n\u201cJust as all churches that bear the name \u2018Lutheran\u2019 do not teach the same as other \u2018Lutherans,\u2019 so not all churches that bear the name \u2018Presbyterian\u2019 teach exactly the same. We can, however, speak of what Presbyterians believed historically and compare it with what confessional Lutherans believe.\n\u201cHistorically, as strict Calvinists, Presbyterians taught that from eternity God elected some to be saved and some to be damned (double predestination). By no means do all Presbyterians believe this today. Confessional Lutherans believe that from eternity God chose those whom he would convert through the gospel and preserve in faith to eternal life. See Ephesians 1:4-6; Romans 8:29,30). Confessional Lutherans reject the notion that unbelievers were predestined to damnation, for \u2018God does not will that any should perish\u2019 (see 1 Timothy 2:4 and 2 Peter 3:9).\n\u201cHistorically, and as a corollary of the Calvinist belief in double predestination, Presbyterians taught that Christ atoned for the sins only of those predestined for life in heaven. Confessional Lutherans believe that Jesus Christ, the God-man, was sent by the Father to atone for the sins of all people, and that he did so. See Romans 5:18,19; Isaiah 53:6; 2 Corinthians 5:19; and John 1:29.\n\u201cHistorically, Presbyterians believed that it is impossible for a believer to fall from the faith. Confessional Lutherans believe that it is possible for believers to fall from faith. See 1 Corinthians 10:12.\n\u201cHistorically, Presbyterians have believed that Sunday has replaced Saturday as the Sabbath, to be observed in a way similar to the Old Testament regulations. Confessional Lutherans believe that New Testament believers are free to gather for worship on Sunday (or any other day), without special rules regarding work or recreation. See Colossians 2:16,17: \u2018Do not let anyone judge you . . . with regard to a Sabbath day. These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ.\u2019\n\u201cThe name \u2018Presbyterian\u2019 means \u2018having elders (teaching and ruling or presiding),\u2019 as the only form of church government that has God\u2019s approval. Confessional Lutherans believe that the Lord has instituted and provides for the gospel ministry, but that there are no commands in the New Testament as to forms of organization.\n\u201cLike other Protestant (non-Lutheran) churches, Presbyterians do not believe that Baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper are means of grace\u2014forms of the gospel through which the Holy Spirit gives and strengthens faith. Confessional Lutherans believe that Baptism gives new life (Titus 3:5) and cleanses from all sin (Acts 2:38). Confessional Lutherans believe that as believers receive Christ\u2019s body and blood under the bread and wine they also receive the forgiveness of sins (Matthew 26:28; 1 Corinthians 10:16). Presbyterians do not believe communicants receive the Lord\u2019s Body and Blood in his Supper.\u201d\nIndividual Presbyterians today may have different personal beliefs than what was stated in the previous paragraphs. The key is recognizing that the beliefs stated in the answer are \u201cwhat Presbyterians believed historically.\u201d You will also want to keep in mind that there is more than one Presbyterian church body in our country."}
{"prompt": "Christians and children", "completion": "Is it unchristian to not want to have children?\n\n\nWhen it comes to children, we want to make sure that we view them as God intended: as his blessings (Psalm 127:3-5). If a Christian husband and wife are physically able to have children and choose not to have children, they will need to examine their motives and methods to see how those line up with God\u2019s word. Reasons for not wanting to have children might include concerns for the physical, emotional or mental state of one or both spouses.\nChristian Life Resources, a WELS-affiliated ministry, has good resources on this subject. I encourage you to read especially the three-part series on birth control. God\u2019s blessings to you."}
{"prompt": "How the Bible was written", "completion": "How do I explain to those who don't believe how the Bible was written?  I recently  tried to explain, but I did not do a very good job.\n\n\nPicture this: the CEO of the company is dictating a letter to the secretary. As the CEO speaks, the secretary takes down every word. When the CEO is done, it\u2019s clearly the CEO\u2019s letter.\nAt the same time, the secretary\u2019s abilities, skills, etc. are sure to show through. For example, if the secretary has poor eyesight, the letter will probably be typed in a larger font. Yet the letter remains the CEO\u2019s.\nAlthough simplistic, that basically illustrates how we got the Bible. God is the \u201cCEO,\u201d and various human writers are the \u201csecretaries.\u201d God gave the writers the exact words which He wanted them to use. The Bible describes it this way: \u201cAll Scripture is God-breathed\u2026\u201d (2 Timothy 3:16). Similarly, \u201cFor prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit\u201d (2 Peter 1:21). Often in the Old Testament (written about 1400 \u2013 400 B.C.) you\u2019ll hear God say something like, \u201cTake a scroll and write on it all the words I have spoken to you \u2026 \u201d (Jeremiah 36:2) These words are God\u2019s Words.\nDoes Jesus agree? Yes! One time Jesus quoted a passage from the book of Psalms. After He did, He made a parenthetical, yet important, remark: \u201c\u2013and the Scripture cannot be broken\u201d (John 10:35). He was saying, \u201cThese words are God\u2019s words.\u201d\nThe New Testament makes the same claim. One example is found in 1 Thessalonians: \u201c\u2026 when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men, but as it actually is, the word of God . . .\u201d (1 Thessalonians 2:13) Again, these words are God\u2019s words.\nAnd yet God in mercy chose to work through human writers, more than 35 of them. God used people like Moses, Isaiah, Luke, John, and Paul to write down His words, to be His \u201csecretaries,\u201d and indeed their personality/talents shine through. For example, Luke was a physician. In his books, we see lots of details, as you might expect from a physician. Paul was a learned man, so the books he wrote are often quite deep, even a bit more difficult to understand.\nTo summarize, God gave the Bible through human writers; we can learn a few things about them by reading their books. Yet they remained merely the \u201csecretaries.\u201d The words, finally, are God\u2019s.\nThe preceding information is from the What About Jesus? website, a resource maintained by WELS Commission on Evangelism. The website has many other valuable resources for you and the people with whom you are sharing your faith.\nDon\u2019t let this experience discourage you. Keep taking advantage of the opportunities you have to point people to Jesus, the world\u2019s only Savior."}

{"prompt": "Justification", "completion": "Does the doctrine of Universal Objective Justification mean that all people are justified before and apart from faith?\n\n\nJustify means \u201cto declare \u2018not guilty.\u2019\u201d As a church body, we make this confession in This We Believe:\n\u201cWe believe that God has justified all sinners, that is, he has declared them righteous for the sake of Christ. This is the central message of Scripture upon which the very existence of the church depends. It is a message relevant to people of all times and places, of all races and social levels, for \u2018the result of one trespass was condemnation for all men\u2019 (Romans 5:18). All need forgiveness of sins before God, and Scripture proclaims that all have been justified, for \u2018the result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men\u2019 (Romans 5:18).\u201d\nA person does not benefit from that gracious declaration of \u201cnot guilty\u201d or enjoy the forgiveness of sins without faith in Jesus Christ (Mark 16:16; John 8:24; Romans 3:28; 4:5; Ephesians 2:8-9)."}
{"prompt": "Concern for church", "completion": "I have seen false teachings being preached and growing in the WELS.  This not in the official doctrines or on WELS website but online.  This is from pastors, leaders, and laymen.  I think some have gotten away from the Lutheran Confessions and allowed growing ministries in WELS and outside WELS be the leaders in our thinking.  This is not a hell fire law judgement but an observation from a concerned member.  I personally dislike confrontation so keep silent, but there are issues and I am not alone in this concern. The biggest concerns are role of men and women, church worship enthusiasm, piety, communion, ministry gender roles, and growth without losing truth in purity.  What can be done to stay strong to the Confessions as being correct interpretation of Scripture, yet not being swayed by culture, because I think we are?\n\n\nIf you identify concerns and (potential) problems but keep silent, it is likely the status quo will continue: you will have a level of concern that could include frustration, and ministries will not receive appropriate feedback.\nI understand that a dislike for confrontation can prevent you from speaking up, so I would encourage you to look upon such conversations with others in a less confrontational way. Here is what I mean. Accusatory statements and the phrasing of certain questions can put people on the defensive. How we engage others in conversation can lead to calm, productive dialogues.\nIt is important and necessary for you and your fellow Christians to speak up when there are questions and concerns about the public ministry of a called worker. That is a practical implication of having a Berean attitude (Acts 17:11). \u201cSpeaking the truth in love\u201d (Ephesians 4:15) describes the way in which these conversations are to take place. There is love for the messenger of God\u2019s word, and there is love for the word of God. That word \u201cis useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness\u201d (2 Timothy 3:16).\nSome of Martin Luther\u2019s words are appropriate at this point. \u201cTo recognize and judge doctrine behooves each and every Christian, so much so that he is accursed who infringes upon this right by as little as a hairsbreadth. For Christ Himself has established this right by various and unassailable statements, such as Matt. 6:15: \u2018Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep\u2019s clothing.\u2019 He is certainly speaking this word to the people in opposition to those who teach, and He commands them to avoid false teachings. But how can they avoid them if they do not recognize them? And how can they recognize them if they do not have the right to judge them? But now He gives them not only the right but also the command to judge\u2026\n\u201cOnce the right to judge doctrine is taken away from the hearers, what can or may a teacher not dare though (if that were possible) he were worse than Satan? Conversely, if judging doctrine is permitted, aye, commanded, what can or may a teacher dare though he were more than an angel from heaven? For if this were permitted, Paul would not only rebuke Peter but would also anathematize the angels of heaven.\u201d (What Luther Says. Volume I. Page 418)\nConversations with called workers can help those workers stay true to biblical doctrines\u2014and the Lutheran Confessions, which explain biblical doctrines.\nCertainly, pray for those in public ministry positions. The apostle Paul invited prayers on his behalf: \u201cPray also for me, that whenever I speak, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it fearlessly, as I should\u201d (Ephesians 6:19-20).\nAs a congregational member, do what you can to ensure that your called workers have the time and resources to take advantage of continuing education opportunities. That is a way for them to \u201cgrow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ\u201d (2 Peter 3:18).\nI encourage you to follow through on these suggestions."}
{"prompt": "Jesus' body and soul", "completion": "Hi, \r\nMy question is about something that I have heard said by lots of Roman Catholic laypeople and priests. When they talk about the Sacrament (and I think this is also part of their portion of their version of the Words of Institution), they say \"Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity of Christ.\" I understand that their whole understanding of Communion differs greatly from ours with their dogma of Transubstantiation. I'm just so confused, why they would say \"soul and divinity\"? I guess I could understand the divinity portion, because if we are receiving Christ's Body and Blood, his flesh is perfect, so it would be human and divine at the same time. Is that correct?  \r\nBut his \"soul\"? Did Jesus have during his time on earth/currently have a soul? I think of that as something all of us human creatures on earth and in Heaven have...I don't think of God as having a \"soul.\" I understand Him as being the one who creates our souls when we are conceived. \r\nDo we believe or is it ever talked about in Scripture that Jesus had/has a soul?\r\n\n\n\nA human being has a body and a soul. When Jesus, the eternal Son of God, became true man by way of his miraculous conception and birth, that meant he now had a body and a soul (Matthew 26:38).\nAt death, a person\u2019s body and soul separate (Ecclesiastes 12:7). When Jesus was about to die, he committed his soul/spirit into the hands of his heavenly Father (Luke 23:46).\nResurrection is the reuniting of body and soul.

What he did\u2014including miracles\u2014he did as true man and true God.\nThe relationship of the Holy Spirit to the work of Christ (Matthew 12:27-28) comes as no surprise. Recall what happened at Jesus\u2019 Baptism: \u201c As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him\u201d (Matthew 3:16).\nBecause Jesus\u2019 Baptism was his anointing into the offices of prophet, priest and king, Jesus could cite Isaiah 61:1-2 and state, \u201cToday this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing\u201d (Luke 4:18-21). Just as \u201cMessiah\u201d means \u201cthe anointed one,\u201d so \u201cChrist\u201d means \u201cthe anointed one.\u201d"}

In keeping with what Paul urges in 2 Corinthians 10:5 (\u2018Take captive every thought and make it obedient to Christ\u2019), such study helps our students analyze this theory in light of Scripture. It is no different from how we \u2018teach\u2019 evolution at MLC. Our students need to be aware of such human theories so that they can analyze them thoughtfully and biblically in light of the gospel.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Freemasonry", "completion": "I have a friend who is a Free Mason. I know there is a reason we are not to be. Could you please explain?\n\n\nIn short, Freemasonry teaches work righteousness; it denies the Trinity and the deity of Jesus Christ. Anyone who tries to reach heaven by following the work righteous teachings of Freemasonry will fall short. The Bible teaches that we cannot save ourselves. We cannot be perfect as God demands (Matthew 5:48). We fall short of God\u2019s demands of perfection (Romans 3:23). There is salvation through Jesus Christ alone (Acts 4:12).\nMembership in a church or an organization implies that the person is committed to the teachings and practices of that church or organization. A person\u2019s stated reason for joining Freemasonry might be business networking or friendship building, but membership still sends the signal to others that there is an acceptance of what the lodge stands for and teaches.\nHaving membership in a Christian congregation (where Jesus Christ is confessed as Savior) and having membership in a Masonic lodge (where Jesus Christ is denied) is contradictory.\nJesus\u2019 words are so important in this regard: \u201cWhoever acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven. But whoever disowns me before others, I will disown before my Father in heaven\u201d (Matthew 10:32-33). While a confession of Christian faith in the heart is connected to eternal joys, denial of Jesus has sad, tragic and eternal consequences."}
{"prompt": "Communion at home", "completion": "Can a home church celebrate Holy Communion?\n\n\nI do not know how you might be defining home church, so what I can do is pass along a response to a similar question. The response contained information from the March 24, 2020 Together newsletter.\n\u201cSince restrictions on gatherings vary from place to place, the celebration of the Lord\u2019s Supper will in some places need to be modified, depending on government restrictions and medical guidelines. Some congregations, if allowed by state and local authorities, are gathering in small groups and taking great care to practice good hygiene and recommended \u2018social distancing.\u2019\n\u201cIn other places, even small gatherings are not allowed. There have been questions about how we should proceed when it comes to the celebration of the Lord\u2019s Supper when members cannot gather at church.\n\u201cRegardless of the specific situation in which your congregation finds itself, here are a couple of things to remember. First, while Christians desire to be strengthened and comforted by the Lord\u2019s Supper, we also recognize that there are times when the normal celebration of Communion is not possible. For Christians serving in a war zone, for church members who are in a medically induced coma, for believers who are home-bound because of sickness or infirmity, the normal celebration of the Lord\u2019s Supper with other believers may not be an option. But in those cases we take comfort in knowing that we have the means of grace in two forms\u2014Word and sacrament. The forgiveness conveyed and assured by the written or spoken Word of God is no less powerful and effective than the sacrament. In some cases, private Communion may certainly be available.\n\u201cSecond, we also recognize that there is no scriptural definition or requirement for how frequently Christians should celebrate the Lord\u2019s Supper. Jesus simply encourages us to receive the Lord\u2019s Supper regularly and often. There may be times such as this that, temporarily, the Lord\u2019s Supper may not be available as often as we would like or desire. For that reason, the Conference of Presidents is urging patience with the following advice:\n\u201cWe encourage our congregations at this time to reserve the distribution of the Lord\u2019s Supper for its regular and normal use within the gathering of the body of believers (realizing that some changes in procedure may be made) or distributed privately by the pastor to individuals in need, as is the customary practice. We urge congregations to refrain from initiating novel approaches for celebration of the sacrament.\u201d\nClick here to subscribe to Together newsletters."}
{"prompt": "Christian friendships and sense of community", "completion": "I have been a member at our WELS church for 5 years now. I have strived to talk to all kinds of people at church in order to gain that strong community within our church. I know that God's word and truth is the most important thing at church, but I think Christian friendship/community is also important. Our church speaks truth but the community is lacking. My husband is super involved with church. He is spiritually fed. I struggle because I am raising my young children and can't quite gain those Christian friendships that I am craving. I noticed other churches in our area emphasize community. How do I know when to seek another church? I also read that children can sense when you don't want to be at church. I want to love my church but I don't. I am really struggling and wonder how to manage this when my husband has a completely different experience. I don't want to be a stumbling block to others because of my experience within our church. I have an amazing Christian community with a women's ministry I am involved in but I'm craving this at my own church. \n\n\nYou have a good understanding of how all-important Scripture is and how important Christian friendships are. Christian fellowship is certainly a blessing from God (Psalm 133:1).\nI would encourage you to speak to your husband about your concerns (if you have not already done so) and also your pastor. Your pastor and other church leaders will want to be aware of ministry needs and opportunities. The history of the Christian Church shows that some ministries expanded, involving and including more people, when there was input from congregational members (Acts 6:1-7). By speaking with your pastor and other church leaders, your congregation can be in a position to assess the needs and viability of a moms\u2019 group, for example.\nHopefully, having conversations like the ones suggested above will enable you to feel more at home in your congregation.\nEnjoying friendships with other Christian women is also a blessing. There can even be additional blessings by benefiting from the ministries of their WELS churches.\nGod\u2019s blessings to you and your family!"}
{"prompt": "Addressing the rapture", "completion": "What do we tell others regarding the subject of the rapture?\n\n\nWe want to tell others what the Bible does and does not teach.\nThe Bible does not teach that there will be a secret resurrection of Christians or that Christians who are alive on the earth will be whisked out of this world to heaven prior to the Last Day. People who believe in the rapture usually look to 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 for support for their belief. That section of the Bible, however, describes what will take place on the Last Day.\nThe Bible teaches that on the Last Day, Jesus will return visibly to this world, raise the dead and gather to himself the Christians who are still alive on the earth at his return. Being \u201ccaught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air\u201d (1 Thessalonians 4:17) is what will take place on the Last Day not prior to the Last Day. There is nothing in the context of that portion of Scripture to remove that event from the events of the Last Day.\nIf you would like more information on what the Bible does and does not teach about the Last Day, you will find value in reading this chapter of This We Believe, a statement of belief of our church body."}
{"prompt": "Leviticus 21:9", "completion": "Could you help me understand the context and past reason for Leviticus 21:9?\n\n\nThe immediate context for the verse in question (\u201cIf a priest\u2019s daughter defiles herself by becoming a prostitute, she disgraces her father; she must be burned in the fire.\u201d) concerns God\u2019s will for those who would serve as his representatives as priests.\nWhile the Lord instructed all the people of Israel to be holy and to distance themselves from sin (Leviticus 11:44-45), that instruction applied especially to priests (Leviticus 21:6).\nThe first six verses of Leviticus 21 detail specific ways in which a priest could keep himself ceremonially clean. The next two verses address the ceremonially uncleanness of a priest by way of his relationship to his wife.\nFinally, verse nine explains how the daughter of a priest could negatively impact a priest and his ministry by her sinful living. The verse lays out the penalty for such behavior. The verse illustrates how serious God considered sin\u2014especially when it involved people who were representing him in the priesthood.\nWhile that law is no longer in effect for New Testament followers of the Lord, the Bible still places appropriate emphasis on the behavior of called workers and their families. \u201cHe [an overseer] must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him, and he must do so in a manner worthy of full respect. (If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God\u2019s church?)\u201d (1 Timothy 3:4-5) \u201cAn elder must be blameless, faithful to his wife, a man whose children believe and are not open to the charge of being wild and disobedient\u201d (Titus 1:6). There are high standards for those who, today, represent God in the public ministry."}
{"prompt": "Marriage situations", "completion": "Scripture indicates the only allowable reasons for divorce are infidelity and abandonment/malicious desertion (Matthew 5 and I Corinthians 7).\u00a0 However, what would be the Lutheran view of situations where the spouses were pressured into getting married by their parents or other authority figure, or situations where the couple married in desperation, such as cases of premarital pregnancy or to get away from an abusive parent?\u00a0 I am also aware of situations where one spouse deceived the other, either directly or by lying through omission, about important issues like a large debt or a prior STD, and the deceived spouse would not have married the other spouse if they knew all the information before they got married.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nI Corinthians 7:15 mentions abandonment by an unbeliever as grounds for divorce and I Corinthians 7:39 seems to indicate that we have free will in choosing whom to marry, but I am wondering about cases where there was either dishonesty or manipulation by one of the spouses prior to marriage, or serious pressure to marry from parents or elders.\u00a0 Would you be able to recommend some Scripture passages or biblical principles that could be applied in such cases?\u00a0 Thank you.\n\n\nI have to say that you would be better served by asking specific questions of one of our pastors. That face-to-face forum would enable you to provide context and additional information for your questions.\nWhat I can do is pass along general information on some of the issues you mentioned. This information is from The Shepherd Under Christ: A Textbook for Pastoral Theology.\n\u201cInherent in a valid promise [marriage vow] is that it is given willingly. Although Scripture does not address itself to this point directly, it is evident that the leaving of father and mother and cleaving to one\u2019s spouse according to Genesis 2:24 is a voluntary action. Rebekah was asked about her willingness to leave her homeland and family in order to marry Isaac (Gn 24:58). A pastor will not solemnize a marriage where coercion is in evidence. State laws permit an annulment of a marriage if force or coercion were present at the time of the marriage \u2018unless the marriage has been confirmed by the acts of the injured party.\u2019 Whoever subsequent to the coercion that forced him into a marriage practices marital privileges voluntarily is viewed as thereby giving his willing consent. What constitutes coercion the state laws may well determine. When coercion can be proved, the church too can acknowledge this as evidence that no valid marriage bond came into existence.\n\u201cDeception, or fraud, is an impediment to a valid marriage promise. Such deception may involve the essence of marriage itself (e.g., known impotence or known sterility) or related matters (e.g., claiming a particular social or financial status). What turns out to be a mistaken judgment about a spouse\u2019s wealth or beauty or desirable qualities cannot subsequently be called fraud.\n\u201c\u2026Since fraud used in securing a promise nullifies one\u2019s obligation to it, state laws permit the annulment of marriages that came into existence through deception. The church may acknowledge such an annulment without expressly requiring it. Continued voluntary practice of marital rights after discovering the fraud validates the marriage vows and removes the right to annulment.\u201d (Pages 268-269)\nAgain, your best course of action would be to ask one of our pastors to respond to your specific questions."}
{"prompt": "Women's leadership roles", "completion": "I am aware that the Bible lays out different leadership responsibilities for men and women. However, I feel like this is taken too far in the WELS. There is no biblical basis for women not to be allowed to vote in congregational meetings. If a single woman is expected to give her money to the church, it is not fair that she has no say in how that money is used. It also feels as though the leadership roles women are allowed to take up are cherry-picked. A woman leading the congregation in song as an organist or cantor is in much more of a leadership role than passing the offering plate. So my question is, since the biblical basis for women not having any leadership in the church is not strictly followed in the WELS (women having leadership as organists, Sunday school teachers, choir directors, cantors, altar guild, etc.), why are women kept from other positions where their talents could be used to further God's message?\n\n\nOur church body makes these confessions in This We Believe: \u201cWe believe that every Christian is a priest before God (1 Peter 2:9). All believers have direct and equal access to the throne of grace through Christ, the mediator (Ephesians 2:17, 18). God has given the means of grace to all believers. All Christians are to declare the praises of him who called them out of darkness into his wonderful light (1 Peter 2:9). In this sense all Christians are ministers, or servants, of the gospel. God wants all Christians to share the message of salvation with other people (Matthew 28:19, 20; 10:32).\n\u201cWe believe that women may participate in offices and activities of the public ministry except where that work involves authority over men (1 Timothy 2:11, 12). This means that women may not serve as pastors nor participate in assemblies of the church in ways that exercise authority over men (1 Corinthians 11:3; 14: 33-35).\nWomen can certainly exercise leadership roles in the church in relation to other women and youth. Congregations do well to encourage women to use their gifts and talents in keeping with the biblical principles listed above.\nYou may find value in reading Male and Female He Created Them: A Bible study on God\u2019s loving gift of the interdependent and complementary partnership of male and female. I commend it to you for your reading."}
{"prompt": "Wine in church", "completion": "We are going to have Wine, Women and the Word meetings in church. Is there a recommendation that discourages alcohol use (other than Communion wine) in a church dedicated to the Lord?\n\n\nYour question is one that the Bible does not address directly. Because that is the case, congregations will want to ask and answer questions like the following: How can we best use our Christian freedom? (1 Corinthians 10:24) If a practice is permissible, would it be wise and constructive to adopt and implement it? (1 Corinthians 10:23) Might the exercise of our Christian freedom cause confusion and/or lead people to stumble in their faith? (1 Corinthians 8:9) Will our actions bring glory to God? (1 Corinthians 10:31)\nCongregations determine and implement facility usage policies such as the one in your question. God grant wisdom and love to your congregation."}

While the Holman Christian Standard Bible in the document underwent a major revision in 2017 and was renamed the Christian Standard Bible, the remaining information in the document holds true. It should also be noted that the Evangelical Heritage Version (EHV) did not exist at the time this particular evaluation of Bible translations was prepared.\nI would also suggest that you solicit your pastor\u2019s help with this. He will be happy to guide you through the process of Bible translation selection and, perhaps, offer a personal recommendation or two.\nWhat a day and age we live in, when God\u2019s word is so readily available in our lives!"}
{"prompt": "Ordination in WELS", "completion": "How does one become ordained in the WELS?\n\n\nOrdination takes place after a man has successfully finished his prescribed course of study\u2014during which he concurs with the public doctrine of the synod\u2014and has received and accepted an initial call into the public ministry.\nThere are traditional (Martin Luther College and Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary) and non-traditional (Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary\u2019s Pastoral Studies Institute) prescribed courses of study.\nOrdination is the rite that recognizes the fitness of the individual for the pastoral office and the divine call he has received and accepted. The rite also provides the individual with the opportunity to make public confessions of his faith and promises to conduct his ministry in faithfulness to Scripture, with the help and strength of God. Prayers for the individual and the congregation are an important part of that rite."}
{"prompt": "Meeting other Christians", "completion": "Can WELS please put on an event for a night for 25-30 year olds? \r\nOr one for each age range on different evenings? How do single Christians find a date during the pandemic, without having to resort to social media/dating applications? Personally, I don\u2019t prefer to meet people over direct message or through the internet. \n\n\nWhat you are suggesting can be done more realistically by one of our congregations or several of our congregations combining their resources. The leadership of your congregation would be interested to hear about new ministry opportunities, so please pass along your suggestions to the appropriate people in your congregation.\nEven though you stated your preference about social media, you might be interested to know that there is a WELS/ELS singles group on Facebook. Individuals within that group may know of similar local groups in your area. God\u2019s blessings to you."}

{"prompt": "Praying to God", "completion": "When we pray, do we pray to God or Jesus?\n\n\nThe Bible teaches that there are three persons\u2014the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit\u2014and yet one God (Deuteronomy 6:4; Matthew 28:19; 1 Corinthians 8:4). This means that if we pray to the Father, we are praying to God. If we pray to Jesus, we are praying to God. If we pray to the Holy Spirit, we are praying to God.\nWhen it comes to our prayer life, we can address God. We can also address specifically the Father, the Son or the Holy Spirit.\nWhat a rich blessing we enjoy with God\u2019s gift of prayer!

A human being does not possess that ability.\nYour question leads us to examine the many things and people that can influence our lives.

{"prompt": "John 6 and the Lord's Supper", "completion": "I am a believer from a Protestant church in Germany (which is not in fellowship with WELS) and I have been reading your Q&A for some years. Not only have I learned a lot from your answers, but may I say that many of your answers are spiritually uplifting, they have strengthened my faith and are consoling for me. Thank you for that! - Now I have two questions concerning Holy Communion: 1) At first glance I would think that John 6:53-56 is a strong proof for the real presence of Jesus\u2019 body and blood in the bread and wine. I suppose Lutherans think that this particular Scripture is not a proof for the real presence. Why is that so? - 2) When Lutherans say that Jesus\u2019 body and blood is in, with, and under the bread and wine, what does the \"under\" mean? - Thank you for your answer, and may our Lord continue to give you strength and joy for your job. \r\nGreetings from Germany.  \r\n\n\n\nThank you for your kind words! It is encouraging to know that readers near and far find the question and answer service beneficial.\nThere is no question that John 6:53-56 (\u201cJesus said to them, \u2018Very truly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day. For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them.\u2019\u201d) calls to mind the Lord\u2019s Supper. The reality is that Jesus did not institute the Lord\u2019s Supper until Thursday of Holy Week.\nWhen it comes to John 6:53-56, it is important to keep context in mind. In verses 35, 48 and 51, Jesus used figurative language, calling himself \u201cthe bread of life\u201d and \u201cthe living bread that came down from heaven.\u201d Jesus used those metaphors in the context of believing in him (verses 29, 35, 36, 40, 47). Believing in Jesus is compared to consuming the bread of life.\nIn verse 51, Jesus changed the metaphor from \u201cbread\u201d to \u201cflesh.\u201d Verse 54 adds \u201cblood\u201d to the picture language. The context still points to the intended meaning that Jesus was emphasizing the importance of believing in him as the promised Savior.\nIf John 6:53-56 were speaking of the Lord\u2019s Supper, then verse 53 would make the reception of that sacrament an absolute necessity for salvation. We know that cannot be the case, as the Lord\u2019s Supper was not available for God\u2019s Old Testament believers. What is an absolute necessity for salvation is faith in Jesus Christ (Mark 16:16; John 14:6).\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that the original Greek uses one word for \u201cflesh\u201d and another word\u2014concerning the Lord\u2019s Supper\u2014for \u201cbody.\u201d\nThe formula \u201cin, with, and under\u201d is a way Lutherans confess the real presence of Jesus\u2019 body and blood in the Lord\u2019s Supper. \u201cUnder\u201d states that we only sense the bread and wine. The body and blood are truly present, but they remain hidden from us.\nThank you again for your words of appreciation for this service. May it continue to be a blessing to you and others. God\u2019s blessings to you."}
{"prompt": "The Apology of the Augsburg Confession and Sacraments", "completion": "Hello! I had a question about absolution. In your \"What We Believe\" statements on \"The Means of Grace,\" I got the impression that only Baptism and the Lord's Supper are sacraments, since it does not mention absolution. However, in Article XIII in the Apology in the Augsburg Confession, it says, \"The genuine sacraments, therefore, are Baptism, the Lord's Supper, and absolution (which is the sacrament of penitence), for these rights have the commandment of God and the promise of grace, which is the heart of the New Testament.\" My question is this: Do you consider absolution as one of the sacraments? If so, why is it not in your \"Means of Grace\" section of \"What We Believe\"? If not, are you contradicting the Book of Concord's teaching, or is there definition of a sacrament different from yours? Thank you!\n\n\nThe last phrase of your last question is key to addressing your questions. Because the word \u201csacrament\u201d is not in the Bible, there can be different definitions of the word.\nArticle XIII of the Apology of the Augsburg Confession states: \u201cIf we call Sacraments rites which have the command of God, and to which the promise of grace has been added, it is easy to decide what are properly Sacraments. For rites instituted by men will not in this way be Sacraments properly so called. For it does not belong to human authority to promise grace\u2026Therefore Baptism, the Lord\u2019s Supper, and Absolution, which the Sacrament of Repentance, are truly Sacraments. For these rites have God\u2019s command and the promise of grace, which is peculiar to the New Testament.\u201d [Concordia Triglotta, page 309] Philip Melanchthon wrote the Apology of the Augsburg Confession in 1530-31.\nIn his early years as a Roman Catholic, Martin Luther held to the church\u2019s teaching that there are seven sacraments. In his early years as a reformer, he trimmed the number of sacraments to three: Baptism, the Lord\u2019s Supper and Absolution. By October 1520, with the writing of The Babylonian Captivity of the Church, he no longer considered absolution a sacrament. When Luther published his Large Catechism (1529), he wrote of Baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper as \u201cour two Sacraments\u201d [Concordia Triglotta, page 733].\nThe definition of a sacrament in the Apology of the Augsburg Confession is \u201crites which have the command of God, and to which the promise of grace has been added.\u201d Baptism, the Lord\u2019s Supper and Absolution can fit that definition. Luther acknowledged the three Sacraments listed in the Apology of the Augsburg Confession and the accompanying definition of a sacrament.\nThe definition of a sacrament that Lutherans ordinarily use points to three characteristics. \u201cA sacrament is a sacred act that Christ instituted or established for Christians to do. A sacrament is a sacred act that includes the use of earthly elements (water, bread, and wine) connected with God\u2019s Word. A sacrament is a sacred act through which Christ offers, gives, and seals the forgiveness of sins and, so also, life and salvation.\u201d [Luther\u2019s Catechism. Milwaukee, Northwestern Publishing House, 2017, page 299] Baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper\u2014and not absolution\u2014fit that definition.\nI hope that this clarifies matters for you."}
{"prompt": "Vegetarians/vegans", "completion": "Does WELS have any opinions on vegetarians/vegans? I see it as a way to help God's earth and minimize suffering.  Why are people often so quick to try to invalidate those views?\n\n\nYour question deals with a subject matter that God has neither commanded nor forbidden. Romans 14:1-8 makes clear that dietary preferences lie in the realm of Christian freedom. That means that people are to refrain from condemning another person\u2019s exercise of Christian freedom (Colossians 2:16).\nIn Christian freedom and with godly attitudes, God\u2019s children can glorify him even in the daily routines of eating and drinking (Romans 14:6; 1 Corinthians 10:31).\nThe apostle Paul put disputes over dietary preferences in perspective when he wrote, \u201cFor the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit\u201d (Romans 14:17)."}
{"prompt": "Pastors and books", "completion": "The Bible talks about how we should not support a false teacher or welcome them into our home.  If we purchase books by heterodox teachers, are we supporting them?  Are we, in effect, welcoming them into our home?  My pastor has many books by non-WELS authors.  Is that proper?  He says we can learn some things from these authors that are not in WELS-written books.  Isn't he in danger of adopting some false teachings found there?  Is it a fellowship issue?  \n\n\nOur publishing house offers books from authors beyond our fellowship. Before those books are made available for sale, WELS pastors review them for doctrinal accuracy. It is not a violation of biblical fellowship principles for our members to purchase those materials.\nOn the other hand, it is a different situation if an individual provides direct financial support to a heterodox ministry and then, perhaps, receives a book in return as an expression of gratitude.\nWhen we read any materials, we want to be aware of the author\u2019s public confession of faith and note how that confession of faith might conflict with biblical teachings in his or her materials. Reading critically is key.\nCould the reading of some books put a Christian in danger of adopting false teachings? Certainly. That is always a possibility. That is one reason, among many, why the apostle Paul\u2019s instruction to Timothy is always applicable for pastors: \u201cWatch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers\u201d (1 Timothy 4:16).\nMight I offer a suggestion? October is Pastor Appreciation Month. Perhaps you and your congregation could add some good books to your pastor\u2019s personal library.

{"prompt": "Scene from Revelation", "completion": "In the video \"I bowed on my knees and cried holy,\" what bright thing is Jesus holding in his right hand?\r\n\n\n\nIf I found the right video, Jesus is holding seven stars in his right hand. That imagery is from Revelation 1:12-20. The stars represent the messengers, the pastors, of the seven churches in Asia Minor that initially received the apostle John\u2019s inspired writing.\nThat particular image of Jesus holding seven stars in his right hand is filled with comfort. To Christians in the first century who were facing persecution and who could have easily wondered if God was still in control of things, John relayed the picture of the Lord holding his messengers in his right hand. That picture said the Lord was supporting the messengers of his word, and they were safe and secure in his hands.\nThe overall picture of comfort from Revelation 1:12-20 is that the risen Lord walked among the seven churches of Asia Minor; those Christians were not alone. How wonderful that same truth applies to Christians today."}

{"prompt": "In-person and online Bible classes", "completion": "Hello! I tend to be more introverted and find being in large spaces with people I do not know to be not pleasant. While in a congregation I do have a common faith to connect with others, I tend to enjoy the digital classes and personal studies more fulfilling. Some days though, I am very comfortable with going alone. Is it OK to do virtual/personal studies and attend on the days when I feel comfortable to be in public?\n\n\nIn light of how you have described your life circumstances, your approach sounds reasonable. Health concerns these days lead many people to opt for streaming worship services and online Bible classes.\nIf the concern is being with people in general and not your physical health, then that is a matter you could discuss with a medical professional.\nCertainly, one of the blessings that has emerged in the past few months has been the flexibility of congregations in meeting the spiritual needs of their members. God\u2019s blessings to you."}
{"prompt": "Loved ones in heaven", "completion": "I've read that Scripture indicates we will know our loved ones in heaven. This is a great comfort to me. Then I read where someone said they saw verses that indicated we will not know our loved ones in heaven.  Do you know what verses they could be referring to?\n\n\nI do not know which Bible verses those people may be referencing. The section of Scripture that people often cite to indicate that we will know our loved ones in heaven is 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18. That part of the Bible describes Jesus returning to this world visibly on the Last Day with those who died in the faith and Christians on earth meeting them in the air.\nOthers point to the account of Jesus\u2019 transfiguration, where Peter, James and John knew Moses and Elijah."}
{"prompt": "Catechism Class", "completion": "If I feel uncomfortable being around other church members who are not wearing masks (this includes the pastors), is it okay for me to avoid them? This would include me taking my daughter out of Catechism class because we both feel very unsafe and we do not want to offend others. Catechism started off with everyone wearing masks and now no one is wearing a mask except us.\n\n\nAs I look at church websites, I see a theme of \u201cIf you have concerns or are uncomfortable about in-person worship or Bible classes, please join us online or via our live stream.\u201d That theme illustrates that church leaders understand the different comfort levels people currently have with congregational in-person events.\nConcern for your physical health is certainly a legitimate reason for determining the way in which you and your family receive Christian education from your congregation. If you have not done so already, you will want to contact your pastors, share your concerns with them and see how your spiritual needs might be met.\nLet\u2019s all continue to pray that, God willing, we can soon return to the congregational life we enjoyed earlier this year."}
{"prompt": "God and elections", "completion": "I have non-denominational extended family who believe Romans 13:1 tells us God \u201cchooses\u201d who wins elections.  Is it correct to assume \u201cestablished\u201d implies \u201cchosen\u201d? I\u2019ve always thought God is foreknowing, and allows those elected to lead, but the election of leaders was a freedom he gives people. \n\n\nYou have a correct understanding of that verse. When it comes to worldly matters like elections, God provides a great deal of freedom for people. He lets them think about different options and then cast votes for the candidates of their preference. God certainly knows the outcomes of elections and he will use those outcomes according to his wisdom and will for the good of his Church.\nRomans 13:1 teaches that God has established all governmental authority. Governmental authority is not the result of human reasoning or societal experimentation. Governmental authority is God\u2019s work.\nRomans 13:1 teaches that people in positions of governmental authority are God\u2019s servants (Romans 13:4). This does not mean that all people in positions of authority represent God faithfully; there are some good servants and bad servants.\nWhen the apostle Paul penned the inspired letter to the Christians in Rome, Nero was the Roman emperor. He was definitely no friend of Christians; his atrocities against them are well documented. Yet, the directives of \u201cbe subject\u201d (Romans 13:1) and \u201csubmit\u201d (Romans 13:5) applied even to him\u2014not because his life or actions generated respect, but because he filled a seat of authority God had established. People today still fill seats of authority that God has established."}
{"prompt": "Bible lessons for children", "completion": "I married a woman a couple years ago who has two children from her prior marriage, 8 and 10 years old.  Her children have never had any kind of education with God.  I was born and raised WELS with the benefit of a WELS private school up through 8th grade.  Although my wife is uncomfortable going to my church because of a troubled Roman Catholic upbringing, she is on board with us educating our children at home.  And one of the kids even comes with me sometimes to church because he is interested.  We take a few minutes to do children's Bible devotions and such, which is going OK so far.\r\n\r\nMy question is this.  I'm no teacher, and I don't have access to a WELS school for them.  I've looked and researched for some sort of curriculum to aid in what stories we do first from the Bible, or to just have some sort of structure or plan.  I get overwhelmed with all the different stuff out there.  Compared to the Christian upbringing I had, I feel like I'm not doing nearly enough for our children.  I feel like I'm in over my head. Can you recommend any resources to help give me some sort of structure to teaching them?  Do you have any recommendations on what kinds of stories to focus more on or what order I should go in?\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\nIdeally, as your wife\u2019s comfort level with the church rises, you and your family will be able to utilize all the educational resources of your congregation. For the time being, you could benefit from Christ-Light Sunday School Lessons at Home. Videos of Bible lessons are available free of charge here. Your congregation may have accompanying printed materials. Please contact your pastor about those resources.\nGod bless you and your family!"}
{"prompt": "Planning for the future", "completion": "When the topic of money comes up, it seems we are very quick to reference the parable of the rich fool.  However, this question is focused on the opposite side \u2013 not preparing for the future.  On average, the typical American actually has very little saved for their later years.  Long-term care is very expensive.  From the perspective of assisted living, nursing homes, memory care, etc., one could hardly have too much saved.  Is it sinful or irresponsible for people to say, \u201cI\u2019m not going to worry about it\u201d?  \u201cI\u2019ll let my kids or the government deal with it\u201d?  \u201cNursing home insurance is too expensive, so I won\u2019t bother or worry about it.  I\u2019ll just go on Medicaid.\u201d  Many have a very cavalier attitude about the whole subject until it actually becomes a crisis.  For Christians, what is the right approach?\n\n\nYou are asking some very practical questions. Perhaps we could start by looking at some courses of action to avoid.\nOne such idea is thinking that our plans for the future will successfully address every possible detail. James 4:13-15 teaches us that there are limitations to our plans and so we do best to put our plans into the Lord\u2019s hands.\nAnother wrong idea is that I don\u2019t need to make any plans for the future at all. Scripture explains that everything belongs to God (Psalm 24:1) and God entrusts his possessions to people, requiring that they be faithful in managing what he owns (Matthew 25:14-30). Faithfulness in managing God\u2019s possessions is fostered by planning, as Jesus illustrated in the context of the commitment of Christian discipleship (Luke 14:28-33).\nAvoiding those extremes will put us somewhere in the middle: recognizing the wisdom of planning and the limitations of planning. As managers of God\u2019s possessions, we will want to use the resources God has entrusted to us wisely and faithfully.\nThe problem with the rich fool in Jesus\u2019 parable, as the Lord explained it, is that he stored up things for himself but was not rich toward God (Luke 12:21). His plans were entirely self-centered. God was nowhere to be found in his plans because he had no place in his life for God.\nPlanning for something like long-term health care certainly displays kind consideration of others (Philippians 2:4) and is very much consistent with the Bible\u2019s teaching that selflessness is to be the way of life for the child of God (1 Corinthians 10:24).\n\u201cMay he give you the desire of your heart and make all your plans succeed\u201d (Psalm 20:4). Those are the inspired words of King David. Those words very nicely put the subject of planning in perspective. Plans are wholesome activities for Christians, and God\u2019s blessings are needed for the successful completion of plans."}
{"prompt": "Significant other", "completion": "I am 23 years old and are trying to find a significant other. I have been praying on and off for the last 4 years to God to send someone my way and bless me with a relationship. In an ideal world she would be WELS or ELS. In time I've grown slightly weary. How do I know when or who it would be? What do I do?\n\n\nFor starters, I would encourage patience on your part. God\u2019s design for marriage is that it be lifelong (Matthew 19:4-6). If marriage is that serious (and it is), then waiting for the right person and putting time into the relationship before marriage is worth it.\nYou may not perceive what I write next as being entirely encouraging to you, and I understand that, but I pass it on for you to keep your life\u2019s circumstances in perspective. You might be interested to know that information from the United States Census Bureau indicates that the median age for American men at their first marriage is 29; for women, it is 28. You will draw your own conclusions from those numbers.\nI would encourage you to keep bringing your petitions to God in prayer (Philippians 4:6). God has promised to hear and answer your prayers according to his love and wisdom (Isaiah 65:24).\nFinally, you might be interested to know that there is a WELS/ELS singles group on Facebook. Individuals in that group might be able to let you know if there are similar groups that meet in person in your area. God\u2019s blessings to you!"}
{"prompt": "Nicene Creed phrase", "completion": "I'm interested in further understanding the Nicene creed phrase \"For us and for our salvation.\" It seems quite evident that Christ came down to earth \"for our \r\nsalvation,\" but what does \"for us\" refer to?\n\n\nThat phrase makes clear that Jesus did not become man for the purpose of self-aggrandizement; he did not come to this earth on some kind of divine ego trip. No, Jesus became man \u201cfor us.\u201d He entered this world as man because of lost, sinful human beings.\nMore than that, Jesus took on human flesh not to condemn sinners or teach them how to save themselves. No, he came to \u201cseek and save the lost\u201d (Luke 19:10). Jesus saved the lost by being the world\u2019s perfect substitute in life and its innocent substitute in death. Jesus\u2019 resurrection and ascension prove that his mission was successful.\nWhen we speak the words of the Nicene Creed you cited, we confess belief in being the objects of Jesus\u2019 redeeming work. How blessed we are to be able to make such a confession of faith."}
{"prompt": "Presbyterian college", "completion": "I recently applied to a Presbyterian college because it has an excellent nursing program. Being a WELS Lutheran, is it wrong to affiliate with them? I wouldn't conform to their beliefs but just go for the program. \n\n\nIt would not be wrong to affiliate with them unless you compromise your faith or ignore biblical fellowship principles.\nIt can often be the case that a college or university has its roots in a Christian denomination, but the institution has become a thoroughly secular institution over time. You would want to find out if there is any part of your prescribed curriculum or student life that would put you into situations where you would be forced to compromise your faith or violate biblical fellowship principles.\nIf a person is simply interested in receiving an education at a college with a different religious affiliation in exchange for tuition, and there are no concerns like those listed above, then enrollment in that school is possible.\nGod\u2019s blessings on your preparation for your chosen vocation!"}
{"prompt": "Jesus and the Last Day", "completion": "Many times in Revelation it has been said that the world will get worse before Judgment Day. With everything going on with Covid-19, the election, crime, and the persecution of the Christian Church, do you think Judgement Day will come sooner rather than later? I understand that only God knows when Judgment Day is but I'm asking what you personally believe. That leads me to another question. I forgot what verse this was, but somewhere in the Bible Jesus said he did not know when Judgment Day was, that only the Father did. How is that possible if God is 3 in 1?\n\n\nI really try to refrain from injecting personal opinion into these answers. I appreciate your interest in what I think, but more important is what Scripture says. The Bible teaches that Jesus will return visibly to this world on the Last Day \u201csoon\u201d (Revelation 3:11; 22:7, 12, 20). Existing outside time, Jesus can say \u201csoon\u201d and mean it\u2014regardless of how many years in human history elapse from when he promised to return and when he will return. It comes as no surprise, then, to read that Christians in every day and age have looked at circumstances around them and thought that the Lord\u2019s visible return was imminent.\nYour second question addresses what Jesus said in Mark 13:32: \u201cBut about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.\u201d As true God, Jesus knows all things; he certainly knows the day and hour of his visible return to this earth. It is important to keep in mind that Jesus spoke those words during his state of humiliation\u2014that time in his earthly life when he did not always or fully make use of his divine attributes.\nEach hour and each day bring us closer to the Last Day (Romans 13:11). That is reason why the Bible uses the word \u201cnow\u201d (2 Corinthians 6:2) in exhorting people to tend to their spiritual needs."}
{"prompt": "Mosaic law", "completion": "I was reading an answer published under topical Q&A here about Mosaic law. Here\u2019s a line from it that specifically brought a question to mind:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Mosaic Law had limited purpose and duration. Its obligations ended when Jesus Christ came into our world as the fulfillment of all the prophecies of the Messiah.\u201d\r\n \r\nOf course the people of the Old Testament were no more capable than we are of keeping God's laws perfectly, and if I\u2019m correct, it was their faith in the coming Savior, and God\u2019s promise of that, that saved them, whereas now it\u2019s faith in Jesus who has already come and died for our sins. I know that good works and keeping God\u2019s law are the fruits of saving faith and evidence for it. But when it says \u201cits obligations ended,\u201d that seems to imply there once was an obligation to keep God's law for salvation and now there isn\u2019t. How was that different for them vs. how it is for us now? Thanks. \n\n\nThe implication that \u201cthere was once an obligation to keep God\u2019s law for salvation and now there isn\u2019t\u201d is not accurate. God\u2019s law points out sin and the need for a Savior (Romans 3:20). The gospel is the good news of salvation (Romans 1:16). Salvation has always been through faith in the gospel message of the Savior and not performance of the law.\nThe Mosaic Law, given to the people of Israel, contained civil, ceremonial and moral laws. Those laws governed the people of Israel. The people were not free to obey or disregard them; they were obligated to obey them. That obligation did not mean that their performance of the law was contributing to their salvation. No, you noted correctly that \u201cit was their faith in the coming Savior, and God\u2019s promise of that, that saved them.\u201d\nOnce Jesus came into the world and fulfilled the prophecies of the Messiah, the ceremonial laws in the Mosaic law became obsolete (Colossians 2:16-17). Likewise, the civil laws that governed the Old Testament nation of Israel, as God constituted it for the purpose of bringing the Messiah into the world, are no longer in effect (Galatians 3:22-25). What remains from the Mosaic law is the moral law\u2014God\u2019s will for all people of all time.\nI hope this clarifies matters for you."}
{"prompt": "Untitled", "completion": "There are claims that Nebuchadnezzar himself wrote a whole chapter of the Bible (Daniel 4). I am not aware of any OT Scripture that is considered inspired from God when God didn't speak through a prophet, as Hosea 12:10, Hebrews 1:1, 2 Peter 3:2 teaches. To my understanding of how Scripture comes about, Daniel 4 is the accounting of what took place spoken by the Holy Spirit to Daniel. Am I wrong?\r\n\n\n\nYou are not wrong. God controlled the content of the Bible by inspiring prophets and apostles to write exactly what he wanted written down. Daniel wrote the words of his book. That includes the content of chapter four.\nIn addition to the Scripture references you passed along, we could also add 2 Timothy 3:16 and 2 Peter 1:20-21."}
{"prompt": "Sinful pride and salvation", "completion": "I have a question. There is a passage in Matthew 18:3 - And he said: \"Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.\" To the best of my knowledge God wants the sinner's whole soul to change to be converted. Does humbleness make a difference in salvation? And according to John 1:13 children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will but born of God. Meaning it's God's work from beginning to end, since one can't choose to believe in him and Jesus gives the salvation itself. How does one go to heaven if someone believes it's all of God yet one must be humble to enter it? I believe the blood of Jesus saves souls. How does one trust the Lord when I'm so focused on trusting if I am humble or not?\n\n\nThe context of Matthew 18:3 describes Jesus\u2019 disciples coming to him with the question \u201cWho, then, is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?\u201d Jesus\u2019 answer included the example of a little child and the instruction to have childlike humility.\nJesus\u2019 answer to the disciples\u2019 question warns against sinful pride. Sinful pride certainly can \u201cmake a difference in salvation.\u201d When \u201cself\u201d becomes more important than God, the very first of God\u2019s ten commandments is broken. When \u201cself\u201d becomes more important than God, then \u201cself\u201d becomes a god. If life continues that way, then salvation can be forfeited. This is reason why the Bible states: \u201cPride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall\u201d (Proverbs 16:18).\nSo, how do Christians address sinful pride? They confess it to God. Then, they rejoice in the forgiveness of their sins of pride (1 John 1:9). This is not a one-time occurrence in the lives of Christians. Luther\u2019s Catechism reminds us that \u201cBaptism means that the old Adam in us should be drowned by daily contrition and repentance, and that all its evil deeds and desires be put to death. It also means that a new person should daily arise to live before God in righteousness and purity forever.\u201d Bible passages that reinforce that quotation include Psalm 38:18; Acts 20:21; 2 Corinthians 7:10; Ephesians 4:22-24; and, Colossians 2:11-12.\nAlong with confessing sins, Christians trust in Christ as their Savior from sin. Faith in Jesus means that he, and not \u201cself,\u201d occupies the throne of the sinner\u2019s heart.\nI hope you can see that confessing our sins and confessing faith in Jesus Christ will address the subject of humility. While confessing our sins means that we need to take an honest look at ourselves, I would encourage you to look more to Jesus in faith as your Savior. Focus your attention on him (Hebrews 12:2). As your Lord comes to you in word and sacrament, the Holy Spirit will nurture and strengthen you with his gifts of \u201clove, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control\u201d (Galatians 5:22-23). Those attitudes and actions are the opposite of the \u201cacts of the flesh\u201d (Galatians 5:19-21). God\u2019s blessings to you!"}
{"prompt": "New King James Version Bible", "completion": "I have been exploring different Bible translations. I have looked through both NIV's, the ESV, the EHV, and most recently I have been looking at the NKJV. Is the NKJV an acceptable translation in the WELS? \n\n\nIt is certainly an acceptable translation. Back in September 2011, the WELS Translation Evaluation Committee noted that the New King James Version (NKJV) \u201cwill resonate with people who grew up with the KJV.\u201d\nThe committee also listed these drawbacks: \u201cIt regularly has archaic expressions and word order.\u201d \u201cIt uses the Textus Receptus as its NT textual base, in opposition to the generally accepted practice.\u201d \u201cA number of salvation passages are not gender inclusive (1 Tim 2:4 \u2013\u2018who desires all men to be saved\u2019).\u201d The second item contrasts the number of biblical manuscripts that were available to the KJV translators in 1611 and the addition of earlier biblical manuscripts discovered since 1611.

{"prompt": "Reasoning behind closed communion", "completion": "Our practice of closed communion was recently questioned by a friend of mine who wanted to know why she couldn't commune with us, seeing how she believes in Jesus.\r\nMy question is, can you explain in layman's terms the reasoning behind closed communion?\n\n\nIt is wonderful to hear that your friend believes in Jesus as her Savior. Such faith establishes membership in the Holy Christian Church.\nMembership in that Church is known only to God (1 Samuel 16:7; 2 Timothy 2:19). For that reason, we sometimes call the Holy Christian Church \u201cthe invisible Church.\u201d\nWithout the ability to look into anyone\u2019s heart, you and I need to operate on the basis of what a person confesses. People make confessions of their faith by what they say. They also make a confession of their faith by their membership in a visible church. Their membership commits them to the doctrine and practice of their church. In practical terms, they represent their church and church body.\nIf we keep in mind that the reception of the Lord\u2019s Supper is an expression of fellowship (1 Corinthians 10:17), we will to present an accurate picture of fellowship. While your friend is a fellow member of the Holy Christian Church, it sounds like she belongs to a church that is not in doctrinal agreement with our church. As she represents her church, it would not be an accurate picture of fellowship if she were to receive the Lord\u2019s Supper in your church. Scripture instructs us not to participate in spiritual activities like worship and the Lord\u2019s Supper with those are not united with us in faith (Romans 16:17).\nAdditionally, if your friend were to receive the Lord\u2019s Supper in your church, she would be saying by her actions that she believes what your church believes and practices (1 Corinthians 11:26). You would have to ask her if she knows, understands and accepts the beliefs and practices of your church.\nOne of the purposes of closed communion, then, has the purpose of presenting, as far as humanly possible, an accurate picture of unity in the faith.\nAnother purpose of closed communion is to ensure that, as far as humanly possible, those receiving the Lord\u2019s Supper are receiving it worthily and to their benefit, not their harm (1 Corinthians 11:27).\nIf your friend is not able to receive the Lord\u2019s Supper with you in your church, she can certainly attend a worship service with you and be fed through God\u2019s word. Through the gospel in word and sacrament, God brings the same blessings into the hearts of people.\nI hope this information is helpful for you. Your pastor may have other resources to help you. As in all our conversations, this one too is one in which we want to speak the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15)."}
{"prompt": "Staff ministry program", "completion": "It is two-fold:  What training is required for one to become a staff minister?  What are the typical duties a staff minister performs when serving a congregation?\r\nThank you.\r\n\n\n\nThe training depends on the individual\u2019s age and educational background. Traditional age students embark on a four-year program of general education courses, professional courses and practical experiences. Successful completion of the program leads to a Bachelor of Science degree. Students also have the option of adding a second major in education or parish music. That option adds an additional year to the program.\nOlder students with a bachelor\u2019s degree can seek ministry certification by completing the theology and professional components of the program.\nStudents receiving training in the areas of outreach and nurture, youth work, family ministry, administration, parish care/visitation and parish education. Current staff ministers have titles such as the following: Minister of Music and Education, Minister of Family and Youth, Minister of Discipleship, Director of Christian Education, Family Minister, Director of Discipleship, Program Director, Minister of Music, Minister of Evangelism, Church Administrator, Minister of Administration, Deaconess, and Parish Nurse.\nYou will find further information here."}
{"prompt": "Purpose of pulpit/ambo", "completion": "I am in a church history class and was wondering why we have a pulpit/ambo in our church.\r\n\n\n\nYour question addresses Christian freedom. While God specified the furnishings his Old Testament people were to use in their corporate worship life, he has left us with no such instructions. That means churches have freedom in the management of their worship space.\nHistorically and traditionally, Christian churches have found meaningful purpose in pulpits. As the altar points to Jesus\u2019 sacrifice on the cross and his holy Supper, the pulpit focuses attention on the word of God. The altar and pulpit highlight the gospel in word and sacrament.\nIf churches do not wish to have both a pulpit and a lectern, they can opt for an ambo. That decision also rests in Christian freedom.\nOne of our hymns nicely describes the significance of the furnishings in our worship spaces: \u201cHere stands the font before our eyes, Telling how God did receive us. Th\u2019 altar recalls Christ\u2019s sacrifice And what the sacrament gives us. Here sound the Scriptures that proclaim Christ yesterday, today, the same, And evermore, our Redeemer.\u201d (Christian Worship 529:4)"}

{"prompt": "Souls in heaven", "completion": "In heaven, is the soul of the believer who dies before Judgment Day conscious of the joys of heaven or is the soul asleep in heaven, protected by God, but unconscious of the joys of heaven that we will eventually enjoy when our souls are reunited with our body (glorified body) after Judgment Day?\n\n\nThe Bible provides little specific information regarding what souls in heaven or hell are experiencing prior to the Last Day.\nThe information we do have points to the souls of believers enjoying the perfection and glory of heaven, while the souls of unbelievers are experiencing the horror and torments of hell (Luke 16:19-31).\nMatthew 22:32 speaks of believers living with God in heaven. Luke 23:43 states that the penitent thief would be with Jesus in Paradise when he died. 1 Peter 3:19-20 describes unbelievers in hell who witnessed Jesus\u2019 descent into hell. Revelation 6:9-10 provides an account of believers in heaven conversing with the Lord.\nAll this says that people who have died\u2014and their souls have gone to heaven or hell\u2014are very much aware of their existence.\nWhen death takes place, body and soul separate. Any biblical references to sleep pertain to the body, which is motionless."}
{"prompt": "Jesus and justification", "completion": "What does it mean that Jesus was justified in the Spirit? Is that a forensic justification?\n\n\nI am understanding that your question addresses 1 Timothy 3:16: \u201cBeyond all question, the mystery from which true godliness springs is great:\nHe appeared in the flesh,\nwas vindicated by the Spirit,[d]\nwas seen by angels,\nwas preached among the nations,\nwas believed on in the world,\nwas taken up in glory.\nd. Or vindicated in spirit\u201d\nJesus lived the perfect life we cannot (John 8:46; Hebrews 4:15). Jesus then suffered the punishment people deserved for their sins (Isaiah 53:4-12). 1 Corinthians 15:17 explains that if Jesus had not been raised from the dead, there would be no forgiveness of sins. Without his resurrection from the dead, Jesus\u2019 mission would have ended in failure.\nThe message of the Bible is that Jesus\u2019 resurrection delivered a \u201cnot guilty\u201d declaration from God (Romans 4:25). 1 Timothy 3:16 teaches that Jesus\u2019 resurrection vindicated him as the Holy One of God, the sinless Son of God. While the sins of the world were laid on Jesus, his resurrection was a clear signal to all the world that his sacrifice for sin was complete and accepted, and that he remains holy and pure."}
{"prompt": "Vows and cards", "completion": "I have a question about the keeping of inner vows and promises made to God. Before I become a WELS church member, I attended very fundamentalist churches. During this time, I vowed to God that I would not play cards. The fundamentalist churches look down on all card playing due to its past associations with gambling. I made this vow because I really enjoyed card games, but was made to feel that it was an evil activity. Now, I have come to realize this was a legalistic understanding that I had, kind of like the Pharisees who added extra rules not found in the Scriptures. I would like to be able to enjoy non-gambling card games with my family as a way to build our family relationships. My question is, am I bound under this vow I made to God, or may I confess it as sinful and foolish, made in an incorrect understanding, and be at liberty to enjoy playing cards with my family? I feel that Jesus' teaching in Mathew 5 indicates we should avoid vows, and I feel that this vow was foolish. Can I be released from it? Thank you for your counsel. \n\n\nIt sounds like you made a promise to refrain from an activity that you called sinful but God did not. Now that you see things differently, and correctly, it is not wrong for you to engage in that activity.\nChristian freedom is precious (Galatians 5:1). We do not want others to take away our freedom, nor do we want to deprive it of ourselves.\nSince prayer is conversation with God, share your thoughts with God about your former and present thoughts regarding card playing. Then, live in the peace and freedom Christ won for you."}
{"prompt": "Sin and God's judgment", "completion": "Does God's word speak of judgment on a nation whose people disobey his word, as in abortion, where it has been made legal but is contrary to God's Word to murder?\n\n\nThe Bible provides examples of nations that experienced God\u2019s judgment for their godlessness. The worldwide flood in Noah\u2019s day comes to mind first; all nations were destroyed. Other examples include the northern tribes of Israel, and all the nations in Isaiah 10 \u2013 34 that faced God\u2019s judgment.\nThe Bible makes it clear that \u201cRighteousness exalts a nation, but sin condemns any people\u201d (Proverbs 14:34). Also, \u201cBlessed is the nation whose God is the LORD, the people he chose for his inheritance\u201d (Psalm 33:12). Psalm 2 offers an interesting picture of the relationship between God and the nations of the world and their rulers.\nAll this is reason why, in the context of your question, it is important for us to offer a prayer like this: \u201cAlmighty and eternal God, who created this world and all of us in it, we thank you for the blessing of our life. And we thank You that You created us wonderfully. Lead all people everywhere to see Your work in the creation of life and to consider human life as sacred. Help us to stop the wanton destruction of newly created life in the mother\u2019s womb. Protect and defend all to whom you give life until that day when you take their life from them again. Lead people everywhere to see the sin of abortion and all other sins and to recognize that they are under your wrath and punishment because of them. And then bring them to the precious knowledge of Your Son Jesus, so that they may have eternal life in His name. We ask this so that Your will may be done on this earth and that Your kingdom may come to all people. Amen.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Eucharistic prayer", "completion": "Hello! I had a question about the consecration of the bread and wine. I noticed that the WELS churches that I go to consecrate the bread and wine with the Words of Institution. But I do not see anywhere in Scripture directly saying it should be done that way, and the Early Church Fathers seem to say that it must be done by a Eucharistic Prayer instead (for example, Saint Ambrose; De fide ad Gratianum 4.10.125). So, what is the proper way to consecrate it? Is it the Words of Institution that Christ said? Is it when Christ had given thanks over it before He distributed it (Matthew 26:26; Mark 14:22; Luke 22:19; 1 Corinthians 11:24)? And does this matter? Thank you for your time!\n\n\nThe Shepherd Under Christ, a pastoral theology textbook used at our seminary for many years, provides this explanation for the consecration of the elements.\n\u201cEssentially the consecration consists in speaking the words of institution over the visible elements. Its purpose is, first of all, to show that it is the pastor\u2019s intention to carry out Jesus\u2019 institution and to set the visible elements apart for use in the sacrament. It furthermore serves as a prayer that the Lord may do what He has promised, as a confession that the body and blood of Christ are present in the sacrament, and as an invitation to the communicants to appropriate Jesus\u2019 promise by faith.\n\u201cSuch a use of the words of institution in consecrating the visible elements is an ancient custom (cf 1 Cor 10:16), but the words are not to be considered a magic formula that affects a change in the elements. The presence of the body and blood does not depend on the simple repeating of the words but comes about through the gracious working of the Lord, whose promise is connected with the words. The real presence is therefore also not dependent on the faith of the man who speaks the words.\u201d\nIf you would like to pursue the topic further, I would recommend reading The History and Use of the Eucharistic Prayer. It is available free from the Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary Essay File. One of the points of the paper is the following: \u201cLuther\u2019s liturgical reform of the Canon of the Mass was radical. Because the Canon strongly inculcates the view of the Mass as sacrifice, Luther in both his Formula Missae of 1523 and his Deutsche Messe of 1526 eliminated the entire Canon (Anaphora, Eucharistic Prayer) from the service with the exception of the bare Words of Institution which he retained. This practice has generally prevailed in Lutheranism to this present day.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Stepmother and church", "completion": "What should I do if I was confirmed in a WELS church and my stepmom won't let me go? She insists on taking me to another church that is nothing like I learned. I have tried talking to her but I am now to afraid to say what I believe.\n\n\nThere is information I am lacking as I try to respond to your question. If you were confirmed in one of our congregations, that means you established communicant membership there. Are you still a member of that congregation? If so, you will want to speak to your pastor about your situation. He would also want to speak to your stepmother.\nYour age is another piece of information I do not have. I do not know if you are dependent on your stepmother for a ride to church or if you have other ways of getting to church (while speaking to your stepmother about this of course).\nI also do not know if your father is in the picture and if he belongs to one of our congregations. Input from him would be valuable.\nWith the limited information I do have, all I can suggest is that you overcome your fear of speaking to your stepmother and have another conversation with her about this subject. Perhaps you could list the teachings of her church that go against what you learned and confessed to be true at your confirmation. Use a Bible in your conversation, asking your stepmother to explain her church\u2019s teachings while you explain your faith. God bless such a conversation."}
{"prompt": "Emergency calls", "completion": "Hello! I had a question about laymen ordaining pastors in an emergency. For example, in the Soviet Union, many Lutheran pastors were killed, and laymen were left with no pastor. So, because they did not have access to one, and since the need for one was huge, they ordained their own leaders. Was this a valid ordination? If so, why? Are there verses from Scripture (or Early Church writings) that show this to be valid (either by example or by implication)? Thank you for your time.\n\n\nWith your question on ordination, we need to back up one step. It is a divine call that enables a person to serve in the public ministry, to serve on behalf of others (1 Corinthians 9:14; Ephesians 4:11; 1 Timothy 3:1-10). Ordination is \u201cpublic recognition or confirmation of the validity and legitimacy of the call that was sent and accepted.\u201d (The Shepherd Under Christ, page 49). Ordination and installation are matters of adiaphora in that Scripture does not expressly command them nor forbid them. They are certainly meaningful, significant and historic customs that include the laying on of hands (Acts 6:6; 13:3; 1 Timothy 4:4; 5:22; 2 Timothy 1:6).\nIf Christians, in times of emergency as your question illustrated, call a non-theologically trained man to serve as their pastor temporarily, that is a valid call. Any ordination that followed would validate the issuance and acceptance of the call."}
{"prompt": "Satan and God's control", "completion": "Does Satan have to abide by any rules, here on earth, and what, if any, are there?\r\n\n\n\nSatan has to abide by God\u2019s rules in that he is under God\u2019s control. Satan\u2019s interactions with God, described in Job 1 and 2, demonstrate that he cannot do whatever he wants to do. Satan can do only what God, in his wisdom, allows.\nRevelation 20:3 provides more detail on God\u2019s control of Satan in the \u201cshort time\u201d before the Last Day. Revelation 20:10 previews what finally awaits Satan."}
{"prompt": "Pastor joining WELS", "completion": "How would a pastor from another Synod go about coming to the WELS?\n\n\nThe Bylaws of WELS address your question.\n\u201cSection 4.60 Colloquium Committee (a) Pastors and male teachers from church bodies not in fellowship with the synod shall apply for membership by written application to the president of the district within which the applicant resides. Notice of such application shall be published by the district president at least twice in Forward in Christ and/or on the WELS website and/or by other electronic means. (b) A Colloquium Committee shall be appointed by the president. The committee shall be composed of the district president of the district in which the applicant resides, a professor from Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary for the colloquy of a pastor, or a professor from Martin Luther College educational track for the colloquy of a teacher, and a vice president of the synod. The vice-president shall be chairman of the committee. (c) If the applicant is approved by the Colloquium Committee, he shall be eligible for a call, and notice of such approval shall be published by the chairman of the Colloquium Committee in Forward in Christ and/or on the WELS website and/or by other electronic means.\u201d\nA portion of a Together newsletter described one pastor\u2019s colloquy experience.\nThe pastor who is interested in joining WELS would first determine in which district of WELS he resides and then contact the appropriate district president.

{"prompt": "Adultery", "completion": "What is the Bible's position on adultery?  Is it against one of the commandments?   Where are the commandments in our NIV Bibles?  \n\n\nGod forbids adultery. That subject matter is one of the commandments listed in Exodus 20:1-17 and Deuteronomy 5:5-21. Exodus 20:14 and Deuteronomy 5:18 specifically prohibit adultery."}
{"prompt": "Baptism and the Holy Spirit", "completion": "Hi, \r\n\r\nMy wife and I were discussing infant Baptism, more specifically infant and unborn babies being able to believe and be saved who have not been baptized and come from parents who do not believe.\r\n\r\nMy feeling was that a baby has to be able to hear the Gospel in order to be saved. In more detail, the Holy Spirit works through that message, and that babies that do not hear the Gospel cannot be saved.  \r\n\r\nMy wife's thought is that the Holy Spirit cannot be limited by people, and we do not know how he can work and what his power is. \r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts? Thanks!\n\n\nThe Bible teaches that all people are sinners from conception and in need of God\u2019s forgiveness (Psalm 51:5). The Bible also teaches that the Holy Spirit works saving faith in people\u2019s hearts through the gospel (Romans 10:17).\nCan God bring people to saving faith apart from the means of grace, the gospel in word and sacraments? Certainly. God can do anything. When we limit ourselves to what the Bible teaches, then we acknowledge that Scripture does not inform us of any other way of God working saving faith in people than through the gospel in word and sacraments.\nPossessing that information, the Christian Church seeks to reach all nations with Baptism and the word of God (Matthew 28:19-20), recognizing that faith in Jesus saves, while unbelief condemns (Mark 16:16)."}
{"prompt": "Firstborn sons", "completion": "In Exodus 13:11-15 the Bible speaks of the firstborn of every womb and to redeem the firstborn among your sons.   Did this mean they sacrificed firstborn sons or that they dedicated their firstborn to serve the Lord?  What does it mean to redeem each firstborn son?\n\n\nDuring the tenth plague, the Lord killed all the firstborn males and the firstborn animals of the Egyptians (Exodus 12:29). In the first Passover, the Lord spared the Israelites; that included the firstborn males and the firstborn animals.\nAfter the first Passover, the Lord instructed Moses to tell the people of Israel that, because he had spared the firstborn of men and animals, they belonged to him. Firstborn animals were to be sacrificed to the Lord. That was not the case with firstborn sons; God never commanded or desired human sacrifices (Deuteronomy 12: 31; 18:10). What God did command was the consecrating of firstborn males to him.\nWhen God established the priesthood with the tribe of Levi, he also made it possible for Israelites from other tribes to redeem their firstborn males from special service to him (Numbers 3:39-51; 18:15-16). That redemption was an ongoing reminder of God\u2019s grace in sparing the people of Israel from the destruction of the tenth plague."}
{"prompt": "Marriage and lust", "completion": "Matthew 5:28 says that if you look at a woman lustfully, you commit adultery with her in your heart. But what about when it comes to your spouse? Can you look at or think about your spouse lustfully without sinning? Would it not be considered adultery because you are married to that person? Is it somehow apart the unity of marriage (two becoming one flesh)?\n\n\nGod designed sexual relations for the marriage bond (Hebrews 13:4). The verse that you cited from Jesus\u2019 Sermon on the Mount speaks of sinful thoughts toward a person who is not part of the marriage bond.\nWith your questions in mind, it could happen that a person\u2019s thoughts of his or her spouse could distort God\u2019s design for marriage, in that the person views his or her spouse simply as a sex object. 1 Corinthians 7 teaches how husbands and wives are to view each other and themselves when it comes to their sexual lives. As in other areas of married life, selflessness is the key: we put others first in life."}
{"prompt": "Leader's guide", "completion": "Do you offer a People's Bible commentary leader's guide?\n\n\nI am not aware of a resource like that. Individual pastors may have created such a guide for their congregational Bible studies, but I do not see anything like that on the website of Northwestern Publishing House."}
{"prompt": "Adam and heaven", "completion": "Did Adam go to heaven?\n\n\nThe Bible does not state specifically that Adam and Eve went to heaven. Still, there is good reason to believe that.\nAdam and Eve were the first recipients of the gospel message (Genesis 3:15). At the births of Cain (Genesis 4:1) and Seth (Genesis 4:25), Eve expressed faith in the God who promised a Savior to crush Satan. The fact that Adam and Eve\u2019s descendants\u2014early on\u2014began to \u201ccall on the name of the Lord\u201d (Genesis 4:26) points to their own lives of faith and their faithfulness in teaching the faith to their family members."}
{"prompt": "Sola Scriptura in context", "completion": "Recently I've been struggling with sola Scriptura (Scripture alone). I've read the verses pointed to as evidence, but I'm having a hard time connecting them as evidence for sola Scriptura. In their context, they don't seem like proof. How should the dots be connected between these verses?\n\n\nGod makes it very clear that people are not to add to or subtract from his word (Deuteronomy 4:2; Revelation 22:18-19). The context shows that God is responsible for the content of his word and he considers any tampering of it to be a serious offense.\nEphesians 2:20 teaches that God\u2019s word, written through the prophets and apostles, is the foundation of the Christian Church, and Jesus Christ is the chief cornerstone. The context illustrates that there is a single foundation to the \u201cbuilding\u201d (Ephesians 2:21), and the Church rests on the foundation of God\u2019s word.\nLuke 16:29 teaches that people are not to look anywhere else for saving truth. The context concerns the rich fool in hell who wanted his brothers on earth to avoid hell and enjoy salvation by means of a special revelation instead of the clear words of Scripture.\nMatthew 15:7-9 is the record of Jesus\u2019 words of condemnation of those who tried to supplement the word of God. The context addresses the practice of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law in adding to what Scripture says.\nHebrews 1:1-2 teaches that God spoke through his inspired writers and provided the \u201clast word\u201d through his Son, Jesus Christ. The context shows that we are not to look to any other supposed revelations about God.\nKey Bible passages, understood in their context, clearly teach sola Scriptura (Scripture alone). I hope this is helpful for you."}
{"prompt": "Endorsing candidates", "completion": "Regarding a question about who you would endorse for U.S. president, you gave the following response:\r\n\r\n\"WELS does not endorse any candidate for political office. Doing so would be a violation of the Internal Revenue Code and jeopardize the synod\u2019s tax-exempt status.\"\r\n\r\nWould it not be highly improper to let government benefits affect what the synod or its congregations would endorse or not endorse? I feel like the only thing guiding the preaching and official statements of a church body should be the Word of God. If the church, as a consequence of that, would lose various economic benefits, that's a price we as Christians should be ready to pay (Rev. 13:17).\n\n\nIn This We Believe, we make this profession: \u201c2. We believe that God has given the church and the state their own distinct responsibilities. To the church the Lord has assigned the responsibility of calling sinners to repentance, of proclaiming forgiveness through the cross of Christ, and of encouraging believers in their Christian living. The purpose is to lead the elect of God to eternal salvation through faith in Christ. To the state the Lord has assigned the duty of keeping good order and peace, of punishing the wrongdoer, and of arranging all civil matters in society (Romans 13:3,4). The purpose is \u2018that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness\u2019 (1 Timothy 2:2).\n\u201c3. We believe that the only means God has given to the church to carry out its assigned purpose are the Word and sacraments (Matthew 28:19,20). People are converted by the Holy Spirit only through the message of law and gospel, sin and grace, the wrath of God against sin and the mercy of God in Christ. We believe that the means given to the state to fulfill its assignment is civil law with its punishments and rewards, set up and used according to the light of reason (Romans 13:4). The light of reason includes the natural knowledge of God, the natural knowledge of the law, and conscience.\n\u201c4. We believe the proper relation is preserved between the church and the state only when each remains within its divinely assigned sphere and uses its divinely entrusted means. The church should not exercise civil authority nor interfere with the state as the state carries out its responsibilities. The state should not become a messenger of the gospel nor interfere with the church in its preaching mission. The church should not attempt to use the civil law and force to lead people to Christ. The state should not seek to govern by means of the gospel. On the other hand, the church and the state may cooperate in an endeavor as long as each remains within its assigned place and uses its entrusted means.\u201d\nEndorsing political candidates is not a function of the church. Jeopardizing tax-exempt status by doing so would be irresponsible and a mismanagement of God\u2019s gifts. What the church does is teach and encourage responsible citizenship.\u00a0 That includes exercising the right to vote.\nThe \u201cmark\u201d or seal in Revelation 13:16-17 is a symbolic way of denoting ownership: those people belong to the beast. Just as God\u2019s people are symbolically marked or sealed (Revelation 7:4), so those who belong to Satan are also symbolically marked or sealed."}
{"prompt": "Wedding music", "completion": "I am getting married soon and, as a member of a WELS church, I would like to have it in my home church. However, my mother has brought to my attention that some of the music I want played at my wedding is not allowed in a church setting or service, such as \u201cAll of Me\u201d by John Legend. Could you direct me to where in the Bible it specifies which kind of music is allowed in a church? I don\u2019t want to be disrespectful, but my fianc\u00e9 and I value music highly and would really like to include instrumental versions of other songs, along with the worship songs we choose. If you could provide some clarity, I would greatly appreciate it. God bless. \n\n\nCongratulations on your upcoming marriage. It is wonderful to hear of your desire to have your wedding in your home church.\nThere are of course no Bible passages that specifically state \u201cwhich kind of music is allowed in a church.\u201d What we want to do is understand what the Bible says about worshiping the Lord with fellow believers and then make appropriate applications to our lives.\nTo begin with, it goes without saying that God is the focus of our worship services (Psalm 115:1). That is true whether we are thinking of a regular worship service or a special worship service such as a funeral or a wedding. If God is not the focus of those special worship services, then a funeral is filled with eulogies and a wedding is all about the bride and groom, and the music can very well reflect that. On the other hand, when God is the focus of all our worship services, then the music involved will give evidence of that truth.\nEphesians 5:19-20 states: \u201cSing and make music from your heart to the Lord, always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d The music that fills our worship services is directed to God. It is thankfulness to God, especially for the gift of his Son, that forms the main content of our worship and music (Psalm 95:2). Music in a wedding worship service that focuses exclusively on human relationships can easily distract from worship\u2019s main purpose of glorifying God.\n1 Corinthians 14:40 adds the thought that all things in a worship service are to be done \u201cin a fitting and orderly way.\u201d We can arrive at appropriate musical selections for a wedding worship service by asking and answering the question: \u201cWhat is fitting?\u201d\nYour question is an important one. I am glad you asked it. Your question is one that your pastor will address in pre-marital counseling with you and your fianc\u00e9. He will be glad to explain what music is appropriate for the worship service that will be your wedding. God\u2019s blessings to you and your fianc\u00e9."}
{"prompt": "Christmas Day and trees", "completion": "Why do we celebrate Yeshua's birthday on Christmas? He was not born on December 25th. It seems like the \"church\" put it on that day which shares pagan worship of false gods. I don't believe in this. Has the \"church\" changed who the real Jesus was and is? Yeshua did not come to start His own religion but to teach and follow God's word. Sometimes I think we go against what He actually was and is. Seems like false teaching and adding to the Bible has been done by these so-called leaders. Jeremiah 10:2 \"Thus saith the Lord, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them. 3 For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe. 4 They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not. Sounds like a Christmas tree?\r\nI want to follow the real God. The real Yeshua. I'm confused and scared I'm believing in the wrong way.\n\n\nWe do not know the date of Jesus\u2019 birth in Bethlehem. The Bible does not list that date. There are no historical records for that momentous event. Numerous ideas have been proposed for the origin of December 25 as the date of Jesus\u2019 birth. Those ideas range from early Christians\u2019 belief that Jesus was born on that day to the establishment of a Christian holiday that would counter a heathen festival. The date of Jesus\u2019 birth is not known.\nWhat we do know is the reason Jesus became man. Standing before Pontius Pilate, Jesus said, \u201cThe reason I was born and came into the world is to testify to the truth.\u201d The truth of the Bible is that all people are sinners in need of a Savior, and Jesus is that Savior. Galatians 4:4-5 states: \u201cBut when the set time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those under the law, that we might receive adoption to sonship.\u201d We can praise God on December 25 and every day of the year for sending a Savior, his Son.\nThe verses from Jeremiah 10 that you cited are not descriptions of Christmas trees. In the verse immediately following the verses you listed, Jeremiah explains what that tree was all about: \u201cLike a scarecrow in a cucumber field, their idols cannot speak\u201d (Jeremiah 10:5). Jeremiah was describing the manufacturing of an idol, not a Christmas tree. People were making those idols in Jeremiah\u2019s day\u2014600 years before Jesus\u2019 birth in Bethlehem. Christians today who use Christmas trees in their celebration of Christmas are worshiping Jesus not a tree.\nBy believing in the Triune God and Jesus Christ as your Savior, you are following the real God (John 5:24). You can rest assured that your faith is not misplaced (1 Peter 2:6). God\u2019s blessings to you."}
{"prompt": "Masks in church", "completion": "Many Christians believe that Christians should be appalled that they are asked to wear a mask in Jesus' house, church.  \"Out of all the places you should feel safe and respectful, it is church,\" is what I hear.

Thanks for your response!\n\n\nA Together newsletter from March 2020 addressed your question.\n\u201cThe Fourth Commandment and other words of Scripture remind us not only to show respect and obedience to governmental authorities, but also to remember them in our prayers as they make decisions to safeguard our nation.\n\u201cAccording to the Fifth Commandment, we have the responsibility not to do anything to hurt or harm our neighbor (or ourselves, for that matter), but to help our neighbor in times of need.\u201d\nIn addition to information like this in the Together newsletters, WELS Congregational Services offers resources for congregations to carry out their ministries in these challenging times.\nGod speed the day when we can return to the corporate worship life we enjoyed a year ago."}
{"prompt": "Revelation 13", "completion": "Hi!\r\n\r\nWhat is the mark of the beast?\r\n\r\nIs the mark of the beast a chip?\r\n\r\nIf not, is the mark of the beast an electronic tattoo?\r\n\r\nWhat is the beast?\r\n\r\nWho is the beast?\n\n\nThe mark of the beast is not a chip or an electronic tattoo. The marking is a symbolic indicator of those people who have aligned themselves with ungodly powers. That is in contrast to an earlier (Revelation 7:3) marking or sealing of people who belong to the Lord.\nThe symbolic markings illustrate Jesus\u2019 words: \u201cWhoever is not with me is against me\u201d (Matthew 12:30). There is no middle ground when it comes to Jesus.\nThere are two beasts in Revelation 13. The first beast is often understood as anti-Christian governmental authorities. The second beast is often understood as the great Antichrist or any authorities in churches who oppose the gospel of Jesus Christ."}
{"prompt": "Miraculous meals", "completion": "Are there two accounts of Jesus feeding the crowd? One for 5,000 and one for 4,000?\n\n\nThere are two accounts. That becomes very clear when we consider the conversation that took place between Jesus and his disciples in Mark 8:18-20: \u201cAnd don\u2019t you remember? When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?\u201d \u201cTwelve,\u201d they replied. \u201cAnd when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?\u201d They answered, \u201cSeven.\u201d\nIt is a generous God who gives us our daily bread through supernatural or ordinary means.

{"prompt": "Dealing with death", "completion": "When referring to myself, a believer, can I choose happiness? \r\nSpecifically, can a believer chose to be happy when dealing with multiple grief or tragic events in a very short period of time? I'm not asking about sadness from despair or guilt of sins, but multiple deaths of loved ones. Or does happiness come through the works of God? Thank you.\n\n\nAs a Christian, the new self in you can certainly choose to be happy and rejoice in the midst of difficulties. As you noted, such happiness is possible only because of God\u2019s deeds and promises.\nAt the end of a terrifically disastrous day, one in which he lost his possessions and his children, Job in the Old Testament said, \u201cThe LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised\u201d (Job 1:20). Job\u2019s response was not typical of human nature. His response of praise came from without\u2014from God.\nWhen it comes to the death of fellow Christians, Job\u2019s response can be ours through the power of God (Philippians 2:13). While the death of fellow Christians can sadden our lives because of our temporary separation from them, there is reason for joy and praise when we think of their new lives in the presence of God in heaven. This is the reason why the Christian\u2019s grief is different from the unbeliever\u2019s grief (1 Thessalonians 4:13-18).\nThe reasons why Christians can have the attitudes of joy and praise at the death of fellow Christians are God\u2019s deeds and promises. One of our hymns reminds us: \u201cIn the midst of earthly life Snares of death surround us. Who shall help us in the strife Lest the foe confound us? You only, Lord, you only!\u2026\u201d \u201cIn the midst of death\u2019s dark vale Pow\u2019rs of hell o\u2019ertake us, Who will help when they assail, Who secure will make us? You only, Lord, you only!\u2026\u201d (Christian Worship 534:1-2)\nBy his own death and resurrection, Jesus Christ \u201chas destroyed death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel\u201d (2 Timothy 1:10). Jesus, the risen Savior, promises: \u201cI am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die\u201d (John 11:25-26).\nLiving in a world so thoroughly affected by sin negatively impacts our joy and happiness as children of God. That is why we look forward to the complete removal of sin and its effects in our lives; we look forward to the time when we will experience perfect joy and peace forever (Revelation 21:4). God\u2019s blessings to you."}
{"prompt": "Social phobia", "completion": "Is social phobia a sin?\n\n\nOne definition of phobia is \u201can exaggerated usually inexplicable and illogical fear of a particular object, class of objects, or situation.\u201d\nWhen God created Adam and Eve, they were perfect in every way. Initially, the only fear they had was reverence and awe for God. Once they gave in to Satan\u2019s temptations, however, other fears became part of their lives\u2014including being afraid of God (Genesis 3:8-10).\nInheriting a sinful nature from them (Genesis 5:1-3; Psalm 51:6; John 3:6: Romans 5:12, 19), fear\u2014real and exaggerated\u2014can often surface in our lives. Phobias illustrate our natural sinful condition and demonstrate how far we have fallen from the condition of Adam and Eve at the very beginning of their lives.\nThankfully, there is help for phobias: spiritual, mental and emotional help. While receiving such help, Christians look forward to the time (Revelation 21:4) when the only fear in their lives will be reverence and awe for God."}
{"prompt": "Sinful words", "completion": "Is it a sin to say something created personally looks stupid to you?\n\n\nThe Fifth Commandment forbids hurting people with our words (Matthew 5:21-22). As \u201cstupid\u201d is a pejorative word, telling someone that what he or she made looks stupid has great potential in hurting that person.\nThe Bible does instruct us to speak the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15). At the same time, the Bible directs us: \u201cTherefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing\u201d (1 Thessalonians 5:11). That means we will speak the truth in love tactfully.\nJesus teaches us that the words we speak are important (Matthew 12:36-37). With that in mind, King David\u2019s words form a good prayer for us: \u201cSet a guard over my mouth, LORD; keep watch over the door of my lips\u201d (Psalm 141:3)."}
{"prompt": "Prayer with others", "completion": "Hello. I am in my 50's. I was raised Catholic, 'officially' left the church at age 18, belonged to no church or nondenominational churches, then went back to the Catholic church a few years ago.  I stopped attending after feeling a failure at doing all that was required to be a Catholic, emphasis on 'doing.'  I have recently been wanting to attend a church again but, after the recently revealed comments about homosexuality and the acceptance of that lifestyle by Pope Francis, I have rid myself of any lingering doubts that the Catholic church expresses God's will for our salvation most accurately.  My question is this: where does WELS draw the line when praying with Christians of other denominations? For example, when Christians in a city hold a vigil against abortion, or peace throughout the world? When my family (parents, siblings, etc.) are together for a meal, we pray out loud, \"Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, through thy bounty, through Christ our Lord. Amen.\"  Is it really wrong to join in universal pray with other Christians with prayers that we all agree on? I ask because I have been looking at both the LCMS & WELS churches to become my lasting earthly, spiritual, home. Thank you for your time.\n\n\n\u201cWhether we worship together, commune together, pray together or do church work together, a unity on the basis of God\u2019s word is necessary.\u201d\nThat quotation is from a brief paper that would be valuable for you to read, as it provides a more in-depth response to your questions than can be done through this question and answer service. The paper is from the Essay File of Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary and is available here.\nWhen it comes to common prayers, you will want to keep in mind that it is not the content of a prayer or the form of a prayer that determines whether or not we pray with others. The usage of a common prayer does not suspend scriptural fellowship principles (Romans 16:17-18; Ephesians 4:3-6; 2 John 10-11).\nBeyond reading the paper mentioned above, the best way to receive answers to your questions is by speaking to one of our pastors. I encourage you to do that. He could also explain the route to church membership. God\u2019s blessings to you."}
{"prompt": "Adoptive parents and church membership", "completion": "First, thank you for your time. I have recently been struggling with a decision of faith. I was born by a \u201cmother\u201d who was a drug addict, and a \u201cfather\u201d who is a registered sex offender. Since they could not take care of me, they gave me (and my two brothers) to my grandmother. My grandmother\u2019s health was always bad so she put us up for adoption. We now have loving parents who have adopted eleven children total and fostered many more. Our family are all ELCA members. In the past year, I have found a girlfriend, who is a WELS member.  I have been attending church with her and her family for the past 6-8 months because I love the church, the pastors, the sermons, and overall how the church operates. My girlfriend and I have been taking the Bible Information Class and are about to do the last lesson this week, and I am thinking about/wanting to becoming a WELS member. But my adopted parents are homosexuals. I have two mothers whom I love so very much and never want to hurt them. They gave me and all of my siblings so much love and gave us a new life. They are two of the best people I know.  But I do want to become a WELS member after finishing the Bible Information Class. How can I do this? I know it could hurt my parents because of the WELS\u2019 views on homosexuality. I have talked to the WELS pastor a little bit and plan to set up a private meeting to talk about it soon. But I need more. I am stuck. I never want to hurt my parents, but I know I want to become a WELS member. Please help me.  Thank you.\n\n\nI understand your situation and your predicament. What I would encourage you to do is try to differentiate more between the loving care you received from your adoptive parents and their relationship with God.\nFrom what you wrote, your adoptive parents provided an environment that was free from the problems associated with your birth parents. For that, you are thankful. At the same time, your adoptive parents\u2014by their violation of the sixth commandment\u2014are living contrary to God\u2019s will. For that, you are concerned.\nIf we love people, we will want to share the truth with them. It really is unloving not to share vitally important information with anyone. If we love God, we will want to do what he says.\nHere are some Bible passages I would encourage you to consider. Galatians 6:1 \u2013 \u201cBrothers and sisters, if someone is caught in a sin, you who live by the Spirit should restore that person gently.\u201d Christian love compels us to speak to people who are \u201ccaught in a sin.\u201d Ephesians 4:15 \u2013 \u201cInstead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ.\u201d When we speak to others about sin in their lives, we do so lovingly\u2014seeking their spiritual good. James 5:20 \u2013 \u201cRemember this: Whoever turns a sinner from the error of their way will save them from death and cover over a multitude of sins.\u201d Rebuke can lead to repentance, and repentant sinners enjoy the forgiveness of sins through faith in Jesus Christ. Matthew 10:37 \u2013 \u201cAnyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.\u201d While we love family members, we are to love God more than them. That is the heart of the first commandment. As our Catechism explains, we keep the first commandment when we \u201cFear, love, and trust in God above all things.\u201d The last Bible passage illustrates that \u201call things\u201d includes \u201call people.\u201d\nThe conversation you will have with your adoptive parents will not be an easy one. The WELS pastor with whom you will be meeting can prepare you for that conversation better than I can in this question and answer service. God grant you strength as you testify to the truths of Scripture to your adoptive parents. God\u2019s blessings to you as you consider joining our church family. Church membership is a tangible way of doing what Jesus said: \u201cacknowledging him before others\u201d (Matthew 10:32)."}
{"prompt": "Jews and salvation", "completion": "What would have happened if the Jews had accepted Jesus? Would the rest of us been unaccepted by God? The Bible seems to teach that the non-Jewish people were God's second choice. Would God even have wanted us if the Jews accepted Jesus? This is hard to understand.\n\n\nPerhaps you are thinking of John 1:11 \u2013 \u201cHe came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him.\u201d There was certainly widespread rejection of Jesus by the Jews. It was not complete rejection, however. Consider this reaction to the miracle of Jesus raising Lazarus from the dead: \u201cTherefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, believed in him.\u201d\nWhat we will want to do is keep in mind what it meant for Old Testament Israel to be \u201chis [God\u2019s] people, his treasured possession\u201d (Deuteronomy 7:6). It did not mean that God\u2019s love was limited to the people of Israel. No, the Lord promised Abraham, \u201cThrough your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed\u201d (Genesis 22:18). When Jesus was born, the angel announced to the shepherds, \u201cDo not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people\u201d (Luke 2:10).\nJohn 3:16 describes God\u2019s attitude for all people of all time: \u201cFor God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\u201d In Old Testament times, God\u2019s love was not limited to the people of Israel. God chose Israel to be the people through whom he would fulfill his promises of a Savior\u2014a Savior for all people (1 Timothy 4:10).\nGod made it clear to the people of Israel that they were not the sole objects of his forgiving love. The psalms contain directives for the people to share their faith. \u201cSing to the LORD, praise his name; proclaim his salvation day after day. Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous deeds among all peoples\u201d (Psalm 96:2, 3). Through the prophet Isaiah, God repeatedly instructed his chosen people to let their light shine. \u201c\u2018You are my witnesses,\u2019 declares the LORD, \u2018. . . the people I formed for myself that they may proclaim my praise\u2019\u201d (Isaiah 43:10, 21).\nThank God that John 3:16 contains timeless truth. God sent a Savior, Jesus Christ, into the world for you and me. God sent a Savior into the world for every person in the human race, and he desires their salvation (1 Timothy 2:4; 2 Peter 3:9)."}
{"prompt": "Follow-up question", "completion": "If I may ask a follow-up question please in regard to my previous \u201cvows and cards\u201d question. I thank you for the response. One doubt remains in my heart. What about verses like Psalm 15:4? Even though my understanding has changed about the permissibility of card games, should I not still keep a promise made to the Lord? Thank you for your wise counsel.\n\n\nThe immediate context of the verse you cited is the child of God\u2019s interactions with other people: not speaking evil of them (verse three) and using money for their good (verse five). It would be wrong to make a promise to another person and then break it (verse four).\nYour promise to God was a matter of misinterpreting his will for your life. Recognizing your Christian freedom (Galatians 5:1), you are free to participate in the activity you mentioned."}
{"prompt": "1 Timothy 2:12", "completion": "I Timothy 2:12. What does this mean when it says women are not to teach? Explain, please! \n\n\nThe verse does not prohibit women from all teaching. The directive \u201cnot to teach\u201d is in the context of the relationship between men and women. In keeping with biblical principles, women are able to teach other women and youth.\nYou may be interested in reading Male and Female in God\u2019s World, a restatement of Scriptural Principles of Man and Woman Roles.\nBelow are some excerpts from that document.\n\u201cIn the original language, Paul uses the term for learning as a disciple (in verse 11), and (in verse 12) he uses the term for the kind of formal teaching that Jesus often did with his disciples gathered around his feet. It helps us picture the kind of setting that Paul clearly has in mind with his application. He is picturing for us someone clearly functioning as Jesus did as an authoritative teacher with others clearly in the position of the learning disciples at his feet.\n\u201cWhen we understand the kind of formal teaching with authority that Paul\u2019s words clearly have in mind in the context of 1 Timothy 2, that helps us understand that Christian women are not violating the principle when they take part in discussions in Bible class and also confess their faith whenever God gives the opportunity with both fellow believers and unbelievers. Those are royal priestly privileges that God has given to every Christian male and female, young and old, as Peter so eloquently testifies in 1 Peter 2:9 and Paul also testifies in Colossians 3:15,16.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Moses and Jesus' transfiguration", "completion": "Was Moses resurrected bodily?  If Moses died and his soul went to heaven, how did he appear with a body on the mount of transfiguration with Elijah, whom we know didn't experience death?  Is Moses in heaven soul and body?  Help me understand this.\n\n\nMoses died. That means his body and soul separated. The Bible tells us that God buried Moses\u2019 body (Deuteronomy 34:6).\nThe Bible does not explain the way in which Moses appeared with Jesus at his transfiguration. What can be said is that the God who made it possible for angels, spirit beings, to appear in bodily form (Hebrews 13:2) enabled Moses to appear with Elijah and Jesus on the mount of transfiguration."}
{"prompt": "Thanking pastor", "completion": "I am a shut in. When my pastor comes to my home and gives me Communion, should I be giving him a monetary gift?\n\n\nAn important word in your question is \u201cshould.\u201d You are under no obligation to give your pastor a monetary gift when he visits you and communes you. Your congregation has called your pastor to provide exactly that service to you. If you are not able to receive the Lord\u2019s Supper in church, your pastor is happy to offer you the Lord\u2019s Supper in your home.\nThis does not mean that you cannot express your thanks\u2014in a tangible way\u2014to your pastor for communing you. When I served as a parish pastor and homebound members wanted to give me a monetary gift for communing them, I offered to put their gift in next Sunday\u2019s offering plate in church. Almost without exception, those homebound members did not want me to do that. Instead, they wanted me to receive their expression of gratitude for my service to them. So, I did.\nIf you want to thank your pastor with a monetary gift for communing you, go right ahead. You might very well receive a little resistance from him, but persist as you will!\nYour question calls to mind the attitude that Scripture directs us to have toward our pastors and others who serve in the public ministry: \u201cNow we ask you, brothers and sisters, to acknowledge those who work hard among you, who care for you in the Lord and who admonish you. Hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work\u201d (1 Thessalonians 5:12-13).\nGod\u2019s blessings to you. In these challenging days, you can take heart in God\u2019s promise to you that you are never alone: \u201cNever will I leave you; never will I forsake you\u201d (Hebrews 13:5)."}
{"prompt": "Mandated vaccination", "completion": "What would be the WELS view on a government mandated Covid vaccination?  Some people are saying that by accepting a government mandated Covid vaccine you are receiving the mark of the beast. Could this be true?\n\n\nI cannot point you to any directive that would address your first question. We trust that people will make responsible decisions when it comes to health care.\nThere have been several recent questions and answers regarding your second question. Using the \u201cSearch Q&A\u201d feature will show you those questions and answers. Here is one."}
{"prompt": "Law and gospel", "completion": "Hello, I know this is one of those difficult questions and I\u2019m not the first to ask, but it burdens my heart and my faith more than anything does.  \r\nSo I know the Bible says these things: that anyone who knows love knows God because love only comes from him, he loves every person on this earth, and anyone who lives a godless life is solely to blame; that he doesn\u2019t predestine anyone to hell, but all things are possible and within his power. So when I think of a love stronger than even the deepest love we experience on earth, I can\u2019t imagine that possibility including sending an ignorant human being who was loved eventually to suffer for the rest of time.  \r\nSome say \u201cjust be grateful that he\u2019s chosen you,\u201d but I care about everyone and not just myself. And I\u2019m sure we all know someone who isn\u2019t in our faith who still has an honest, behind closed doors, good heart. My therapist is the most self-sacrificial person I have ever met. His biggest reason for never wanting to, say, be in a car accident, is because he doesn\u2019t want his patients to lose him. He stays hours late in the office if anyone needs him. He loves them all so much.\r\nSo when I see the parts of the Bible where God destroy cities, including children, and shows wrath and hatred, when I later read a verse about his love, I feel that perception there.\r\nI don\u2019t mean to sound offensive in any way. I believe my faith is still a genuine one. I was raised in a WELS school and church, baptized, and I believe the consistent voice across all books and chapters of the Bible is consistently that of God.  I\u2019ve been subject to anger-filled, hatred-filled people and seeing any true hatred in God contradicts the love I need to be able to run to.  I\u2019ve asked pastors in person and haven\u2019t received much help so that\u2019s why I wanted to ask here. Thanks so much for taking the time to read.\r\n\n\n\nI do not see a question in what you submitted, but I sense an uncomfortableness in what the Bible teaches about God\u2019s justice, his anger, and hell.\nAs you pointed out, the Bible teaches that God loves sinners (John 3:16). The Christmas season shows the love of God in sending his Son to rescue sinners (Galatians 4:4-5). God desires the salvation of all people (1 Timothy 2:4; 2 Peter 3:9). This is the heart of the gospel message in the Bible.\nAt the same time, the Bible teaches that God hates sin and sinners (Psalm 5:5). This is what the Bible\u2019s message of the law is all about.\nThe messages of the law and the gospel are not contradictory ones; they are different messages.\nIn addition to the preceding information, the Bible teaches that faith in Jesus saves, while unbelief condemns (Mark 16:16). The nice things that unbelievers might do in life do not lead to their salvation (Romans 3:27-28; Galatians 2:15-16; Titus 3:5). Salvation comes through Spirit-worked faith in Jesus Christ alone (Ephesians 2:8-9). Saving faith, in turn, comes through the gospel (Romans 10:17).\nConversations with pastors about these teachings of the Bible are definitely helpful. In addition to them, I would suggest that you read Law and Gospel: Bad News\u2014Good News. The book explains very thoroughly the different messages of the law and gospel, and addresses your concerns. It is available from Northwestern Publishing House. Your church library may also have a copy. God\u2019s blessings to you!"}
{"prompt": "Praying to the devil", "completion": "My friend wants me to pray to the devil with him.  In doing so, would I be going to hell for speaking with the devil?\n\n\nPraying to the devil is playing with fire (no pun intended). Satan is a formidable enemy, far surpassing our own natural strength (Ephesians 6:12). For that reason, the Bible instructs us to \u201cResist the devil\u201d (James 4:7). Praying to Satan is not resisting him. Praying to Satan could certainly lead to a falling away from Jesus and an eternal association with Satan in hell.\nI would strongly encourage you to reject your friend\u2019s invitation to pray to Satan. Do also warn your friend about this dangerous activity. If you want to say anything to the devil, I would encourage you to say what Jesus said to him, \u201cAway from me, Satan!\u201d (Matthew 4:10)"}
{"prompt": "Spouse in heaven", "completion": "If I die after my husband and when we are reunited in heaven, will we know each other as not only God's children, but as husband and wife? I have been a WELS member all my life and have received conflicting answers. As we mourn the loss of a loved one, we find comfort in being reunited with them in heaven. For some, part of the comfort here on earth is knowing I will see my \"husband\" again. Would appreciate guidance on this issue. Thank you.\n\n\nThe Bible clearly teaches that marriage is an earthly institution only (Matthew 22:23-33). There is no Bible passage that states specifically that a Christian in heaven will recognize another person as having been his or her spouse on earth.\nWhat is clear is that on the Last Day Jesus will gather together his followers, and they will be together forever (1 Thessalonians 4:13-18). This means that we will be together with Christians who were our earthly relatives, including our spouses. What specific knowledge we might have about them awaits us."}
{"prompt": "Roman Catholic Church practices", "completion": "I was born and raised as a WELS Lutheran. I am now a teacher, teaching in a Catholic school. At first, not really a big deal to me.  I attend Mass with my students throughout the week, but I anxiously awaited Sunday to attend church at my church that I knew.  But after listening to Father's homily at Mass, it has made me second guess my feelings on where I belong.  Am I going to church for the right reason or not? Lately, I have been feeling drawn more toward Catholicism than Lutheranism. Why don't we as Lutherans have a time for Adoration like Catholics do? Why don't we make the sign of the cross when saying \"In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit\"? Why don't Lutherans kneel during any times of the service? Why don't we pray to the Saints? Why is Mary seen as important of a figure to us as to Catholics?\n\n\nI will address your questions in the order in which you asked them.\nJesus gave the Lord\u2019s Supper to his church so that they could receive it (\u201cTake and eat\u2026Drink from it, all of you\u2026\u201d \u2013 Matthew 26:26-27) and not adore it. There was no adoration connected with the institution of the Lord\u2019s Supper, and there was no practice of adoration in the early church.\nLutheran worshipers are free to make the sign of the cross at the Trinitarian Invocation (\u201cIn the name of the Father\u2026\u201d). You might be interested to know that one of the general rubrics for The Lutheran Hymnal, the hymnal that most WELS congregations used for decades, stated: \u201cThe sign of the cross may be made at the Trinitarian Invocation and at the words of the Nicene Creed \u2018and the life of the world to come.\u2019\u201d\nIn his Small Catechism (in the Concordia Triglotta), Martin Luther included this preface to the Morning Prayer: \u201cIn the morning, when you rise, you shall bless yourself with the holy cross and say: In the name of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen. Then, kneeling or standing, repeat the Creed and the Lord\u2019s Prayer. If you choose, you may, in addition, say this little prayer\u201d [which we know as Luther\u2019s Morning Prayer].\nSimilar wording precedes his Evening Prayer: \u201cIn the evening, when you go to bed, you shall bless yourself with the holy cross and say: In the name of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen. Then, kneeling or standing, repeat the Creed and the Lord\u2019s Prayer. If you choose, you may, in addition, say this little prayer\u201d [which we know as Luther\u2019s Evening Prayer].\nMaking the sign of the cross is something that God has neither commanded nor forbidden. The same is true regarding kneeling. Again, you might be interested to know that The Lutheran Hymnal indicated that \u201cAll may kneel\u201d for the confession of sins. I am aware of WELS congregations where some worshipers still kneel for the reception of the Lord\u2019s Supper and for personal, post-Communion prayers. At the congregation where I belong, there are individuals who make the sign of the cross when they receive the Lord\u2019s Supper while kneeling. I can see this when I help with the distribution of the Lord\u2019s Supper.\nWe do not pray to the saints because the First Commandment forbids us to worship and pray to anyone except God. To pray to any person as we pray to God is idolatry.\nLutherans view Mary as the woman God graciously chose to give birth to Jesus Christ. Mary received that honor and privilege only because of God\u2019s grace to her (Luke 1:26-38). Mary recognized her sinfulness and her need for a Savior (Luke 1:47). Lutherans recognize that there is only one Savior and mediator between God and people: Jesus Christ (1 Timothy 2:5-6).\nBeyond providing answers to your questions, I trust that you recognize that the biggest difference between the official teachings of the Lutheran Church and the Roman Catholic Church concerns salvation. The Roman Catholic Church\u2019s Council of Trent still condemns anyone who teaches the biblical truth that faith in Jesus alone saves. Lutherans confess and teach what the Bible teaches\u2014that faith in Jesus Christ alone, apart from works, saves (Romans 3:20, 28; Galatians 2:15-26; Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:4-7). I pray that is your faith as well."}
{"prompt": "Pornography addiction", "completion": "Hello.  My question might be confusing but please bear with me. I have been a believer in Christ for some time now. I\u2019m also a fan and avid watcher of Japanese anime. Yet I struggle with addiction to pornography, including lusting after the girls in anime, or I should say the sexually explicit form of the medium known as hentai.  I strive to break free from the addiction and treat the girls in anime with love as I would girls in the real world. Further complicating matters, I suffer from OCD, which is a mental disorder that causes doubt and unwanted thoughts. The OCD has caused me bad ideas that anime girls will be cursed by God due to all of the time I lusted after them.  So my question is: would God curse anime girls by changing them in any negative way for me as punishment for my sin?  Thank you for taking the time to read and respond to this question.  \n\n\nYou do not need to be concerned about God cursing animated characters because of your actions. The characters are not real.

{"prompt": "Bible and family members", "completion": "Hello. I am wanting to know about the Ray Comfort Bible. My family member calls himself a prophet. He says WELS does not practice evangelism. He changes the stories in the Bible to suppose this happened such as the birth of Christ.  \r\nUpon looking into Ray Comfort he was described as not believing in God's Communion. \r\nI often feel trapped and talked down to as if he thinks he is a better Christian. I am concerned for him and another family member who shares similar views.\r\nCan you tell me how to handle this uncomfortable situation? What can I say and what should I not say? I know God sees all. But it bothers me he is leading people astray and actually thinks he's saving them. Ray Comfort's new Bible was recently given to a new family member, knowing I wouldn't like it. \r\nCan you help me in handling this in the proper manner?\n\n\nAs I am not familiar with that particular book, I am not able to pass along a reaction to it.\nYou can assure your family member that WELS is very much concerned about evangelism. While it is finally up to each Christian and each congregation to engage in evangelism, WELS as a church body certainly encourages it and provides resources. You can find some of those resources here. WELS Commission on Evangelism also operates a stand-alone website \u2013 What About Jesus?\nWhen it comes to interacting with your family members, all I can suggest is that you listen to them to see how you can best point them to what Scripture teaches. Perhaps you could ask your new family member what he or she thinks of the Bible that was given. That person\u2019s response could help guide what you say. You might even pass along the resources mentioned above.\nFinally, if it is clear that your family member is leading other people astray, you will want to speak to that person: both for his or her good and the spiritual welfare of others (1 Timothy 5:20; 1 John 4:1-2). God\u2019s blessings on your conversations."}
{"prompt": "Role of women in church", "completion": "What is the role of women in the Lutheran church? I belong to a small congregation and 15 and 16-year-old boys are given the right to vote and hold offices but women aren't. I can't justify the fact that God would bless some women with very high intellects and organizational skills if he did not want them to use them to his glory. \n\n\nYour question requires a much longer response than can be provided here. I would encourage you to read a doctrinal statement you can find on this website: Man and Woman Roles. You would also benefit from reading Male and Female He Created Them: A Bible study on God\u2019s loving gift of the interdependent and complementary partnership of male and female. The documents explain how men and women can use their God-given gifts in ways that are in keeping with God\u2019s design for them. Your pastor would be a good resource for any follow-up questions."}
{"prompt": "Meaning of Epiphany", "completion": "Define Epiphany.\n\n\n\u201cEpiphany\u201d comes from a Greek word that means \u201crevelation,\u201d \u201cmanifestation,\u201d or \u201cappearance.\u201d It is the season of the church year that clearly reveals Jesus Christ as the Son of God and the only Savior of the world.\nHere is a brief article that provides a little more information."}
{"prompt": "Jesus and the Old Testament", "completion": "If God wants us to believe in Jesus, why did he not tell us in the Old Testament that Jesus was the Savior? Why did he not give us a name? Everything seems to be coded or of someone's interpretation. I have been told that Jesus is all over the Old Testament.  Where? Why did the early Catholic church change and add verses? The Old Testament seems to have truly been preserved by God. Why don't we see this in the New Testament? I want to believe, but why does it seem Jesus is man's invention?\n\n\nJesus is the personal name for the Son of God. God did not reveal that name until he dispatched the angel Gabriel to Mary (Luke 1:31) and Joseph (Matthew 1:21).\nWhile God did not reveal the personal name of the Savior until shortly before his birth, the Savior went by many different names and titles in the Old Testament. Here is a sampling: \u201cAngel of the LORD\u201d (Exodus 3:2), \u201cThe Holy One of Israel\u201d (Isaiah 41:14), \u201cImmanuel\u201d (Isaiah 7:14), \u201cKing\u201d (Zechariah 9:9), \u201cThe LORD Our Righteous Savior\u201d (Jeremiah 23:6), \u201cOffspring\u201d (Genesis 3:15), \u201cPrince of Peace\u201d (Isaiah 9:6), \u201cProphet\u201d (Deuteronomy 18:15), \u201cRedeemer\u201d (Job 19:25), \u201cRighteous Branch\u201d (Jeremiah 23:5) and \u201cShepherd\u201d (Psalm 23:1). Those names and titles\u2014and many others\u2014spoke volumes about the person and work of the promised Messiah. When people were led to put their trust in God\u2019s promised Savior, they enjoyed salvation (Genesis 15:6).\nGod certainly preserved the books of the Old Testament. He did the same with the books of the New Testament. To learn more about this, you may be interested in this book from Northwestern Publishing House. Your church library may also have a copy.\nBy no means is Jesus man\u2019s invention. He is the eternal Son of God (John 1:1-3) and the promised Messiah (John 4:25-26). May God convince you all the more of these truths as you read and study the Bible."}
{"prompt": "Fighting temptation", "completion": "Pastor, I have a question that has made me very confused and unworthy of being loved by God.  I have long tried to get rid of the feelings towards the same gender, but they do not go away. I have prayed to God, but the feelings remain. I have not acted on these feelings and will never do so, but they never go away. They are a part of me, but that doesn\u2019t mean I am not a follower of God. What should I do? I feel alone. I\u2019m scared that I am not enough and will be left when he comes.\n\n\nFacing temptation has been the human experience since the Garden of Eden. Jesus himself \u201chas been tempted in every way, just as we are\u2014yet he did not sin\u201d (Hebrews 4:15). The sources of Jesus\u2019 temptations were Satan and the world. In addition to those sources, there is a third source of temptation for every person but Jesus; people possess a sinful nature, an ally of Satan. Being exposed to temptation does not make a person guilty of sin; giving in to temptation is sinful (James 1:14-15). By not acting on the feelings you have, I understand that you recognize these truths.\nThe sad reality is that these sources of temptation are lifelong; they do not go away. That means the person who struggles with the temptation to abuse alcohol or the person who fights against the temptation to use pornography or the person who combats the temptation to lust after another person of the opposite sex or the same sex may have to do so for a lifetime.\nThis is not a hopeless reality by any means. After the apostle Paul described his struggles in fighting temptation (Romans 7:15-24), he exclaimed, \u201cThanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord! (Romans 7:25) There is forgiveness of sins through Jesus Christ. There is power through the gospel of Jesus Christ to live godly lives.\nWhat I can suggest is that you speak with your pastor or other trusted Christian counselor to develop strategies in combating the temptations you face. If you are not able to speak with your pastor about this, you might consider the resources of Christian Family Solutions, a WELS-affiliated ministry. The organization offers in-person and video counseling.\nConquerors through Christ website serves those affected by porn use. You may subscribe to the CtC e-Newsletter and visit\u00a0 CtC on Facebook.\nYou understand your situation correctly: facing the temptations you do does not mean that you are not a follower of God. Christians enjoy the forgiveness of sins, yet they struggle against temptation. Thanks be to God that Jesus Christ lived perfectly in our place and that he took on himself the punishment our sins deserved. Thanks be to God for a Savior who \u201cempathizes with our weaknesses\u201d (Hebrews 4:15) and \u201cgives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak\u201d (Isaiah 40:29). God\u2019s blessings to you."}
{"prompt": "Freedom in fasting", "completion": "Do I need to fast? I have been a Christian my whole life and my stepmother just got into it. She is going to a non-WELS church and they teach it very differently. They are making everybody in that church fast for a whole month. I have never done it and the only thing my kids and myself can't eat are treats, and adults can only have one meal when it is 5:00 in the afternoon. I just need an opinion on what do and think about this. Thank you!\n\n\nI hope the following information from a column I wrote for Forward in Christ will be helpful for you.\nIn Old Testament times mandatory fasting was uncommon. The Mosaic Law called for Israelites to fast on only one day of the year\u2014on the great Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16:29; 23:27).\nOf course, people were free to go beyond that requirement, and some did just that. Without being compelled by any divine directive, individuals like Hannah, David, Ezra, and Nehemiah\u2014just to list a few\u2014fasted. People often fasted in times of sorrow, repentance, and intense prayer. After Jonah\u2019s reluctant missionary work in Nineveh, the Bible tells us that the king of Nineveh decreed a fast for all inhabitants\u2014 including animals (Jonah chapter 3). Eventually, Jews like the Pharisees fasted twice a week to make plain their claims of spiritual superiority (Luke 18:9-12).\nIn the New Testament, Paul wrote, \u201cDo not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink. . . .\u201d (Colossians 2:16). When Jesus completed his redeeming work and abolished the ceremonial laws, the number of required fasting days for God\u2019s people decreased from one to zero. As was the case in Old Testament times though, Christians today are free to fast if they like.\nSo, is fasting something for you to consider? It is entirely your call. That is the freedom of adiaphora\u2014those activities that God has neither commanded nor forbidden. Of course, you will want to understand what is involved in fasting. Do the fasts deprive you of food and/or water for extended periods of time? Are there health risks associated with them? Are there spiritual concerns of any kind? A physician can help you with the first two questions; I can help you with the last.\nAs is the case with any adiaphoron, motives for fasting can be important. Some of the literature I have seen speaks of fasting serving the purpose of \u201cassisting and enhancing\u201d our prayers. In view of that, you may want to ask yourself: \u201cAm I thinking in any way that God is going to hear and answer my prayers because of something I am doing? Am I fasting like the Pharisees\u2014thinking that fasting will put me in a better standing with God and make me superior to non-fasting Christians?\u201d Any thoughts like these would rule out fasting.\nOn the other hand, are there thoughts of controlling the body and its desires\u2014not being mastered by anything, even food (1 Corinthians 6:12)? Are there thoughts of taking good care of your body in which God lives (1 Corinthians 6:19)? Are there thoughts of eating to the glory of God (1 Corinthians 10:31)? Thoughts like these can exemplify good motives for fasting.\nMartin Luther wrote in his Small Catechism that \u201cfasting and other outward preparations may serve a good purpose\u201d in preparing ourselves to receive the Lord\u2019s Supper. But the best preparation, he said, is believing Jesus\u2019 words. Fasting\u2014prior to the Lord\u2019s Supper or any time\u2014can be a beneficial practice, but there is no substitute for faith."}
{"prompt": "Using the cross", "completion": "I got into an argument with someone about the second commandment.  I\u2019m not sure if WELS has the commandments in a different arrangement as other denominations, but the commandment was \u201cYou shall not make any graven image.\u201d  He was using his interpretation of this commandment to showcase that he doesn\u2019t believe in wearing crucifixes because people are trying to formulate an image of God above, and that\u2019s wrong (as he claims the commandment says).  There\u2019s a lot to contest what he\u2019s saying such as, the context in which the commandment is given, the translation, etc., but in the KJV and NIV translations there\u2019s enough slack for him to continue to believe what he believes and have a decent argument. I don\u2019t have enough concrete support to back up the idea that the verse is only in the context of idol worshiping, and it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t make an image of God, religious art, or wear a crucifix as an indication of your belief. Can you please help? As much support as possible would help affirm me in this idea.\n\n\nThe \u201cTen Commandments\u201d of Exodus 34:28 are literally \u201cTen Words.\u201d God spoke ten \u201cwords\u201d that constituted his commandments, but he did not indicate which was the \u201cfirst word\u201d or the \u201ctenth word.\u201d As a result, there have been three different numbering systems of the commandments throughout the years (the Jewish system, the Roman Catholic and Lutheran system, and the Reformed and Greek Orthodox system).\nSince God did not specifically state which is the \u201csecond commandment\u201d or which is the \u201cninth commandment,\u201d it makes little difference if people attach a different number to a commandment or \u201cword.\u201d The content is not changed.\nYour question addresses content that is associated with either the first commandment or the second commandment, depending on how people divide the \u201cTen Words.\u201d Your question addresses Exodus 20:4-6: \u201cYou shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.\u201d God emphasized that command later in the chapter: \u201cThen the LORD said to Moses, \u2018Tell the Israelites this: \u2018You have seen for yourselves that I have spoken to you from heaven: Do not make any gods to be alongside me; do not make for yourselves gods of silver or gods of gold\u2019\u201d (Exodus 20:22-23).\nWith those words, God is forbidding the making of an image for the purpose of worshiping it. What God forbids is exactly what the people of Israel did when they built a golden calf and worshiped it (Exodus 32).\nWhen Christians beautify their worship spaces with crosses or wear them as jewelry, they are not worshiping those objects. The cross is a symbol of God\u2019s justice and love. On the cross of Calvary, God spared sinners and punished his own Son in their place. The cross is a reminder of the depth of God\u2019s love.\nThe Bible itself points to the significance of the cross: \u201cFor the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God\u201d (1 Corinthians 1:18). \u201cMay I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world\u201d (Galatians 6:14). Colossians 1:20; 2:14-15 and 1 Peter 2:24 also underscore the importance of the cross.\nChristians use more than the cross as a reminder of God\u2019s love and mercy. Think of some other items of Christian art you can find in churches: a scallop shell to call to mind the blessings of Baptism, a chalice and wafer to underscore the blessings of the Lord\u2019s Supper, a dove to recall the work of the Holy Spirit, a manger to remember the lowly manner of Jesus\u2019 birth, and an empty tomb to reinforce the truth of Jesus\u2019 resurrection from the dead. Christians are not worshiping these images. These images keep the truths of God\u2019s word before our eyes; they are visual reminders of God\u2019s love and mercy.\nAs God has neither commanded nor forbidden the use of Christian art, using a cross lies in the area of Christian freedom. I hope this information will be helpful for you."}
{"prompt": "Women in the working world", "completion": "You often refer readers to a WELS statement on the roles of men and women when asked questions about the role of women in the church.  If I interpret that statement correctly, women in the working world should also not have men report to them. I was in a very responsible position during my working life and had numerous men report directly to me. I had direct authority over them. Is this statement suggesting that was wrong?\n\n\nYou will often find references to a WELS statement on the roles of men and women when questioners ask about \u201cthe WELS position\u201d on men and women living in God\u2019s world.\nThe statement is not suggesting that your actions were wrong. The statement addresses the challenges Christians face as they live in God\u2019s kingdom of power and God\u2019s kingdom of grace.\nA valuable read for you would be a Bible study on \u201cMale and Female He Created Them.\u201d The section \u201cLiving as citizens of two kingdoms\u201d beginning on page 28 would be especially helpful. It begins with these words: \u201cPart of what may help us walk through many challenging situations in life is to grasp the biblical doctrine of the two kingdoms, or two realms, both of which are under the rule of our triune God. Sadly, this doctrine is rarely taught clearly (or at all) outside of Lutheran circles, and all too frequently it is not even taught or understood well by Lutherans. Failing to grasp what is meant by these two kingdoms can cause us confusion as we live our callings out in the world and can, in fact, unintentionally do harm to the cause of the gospel we long to further.\u201d God\u2019s blessings on your reading."}
{"prompt": "\"In Christ\"", "completion": "Sometimes when I hear people describing objective justification, they will say that \"in Christ\" the whole world is forgiven/justified. What does it mean to be 'in Christ' and how is the whole world \"in Christ\"?\n\n\nThe phrase \u201cin Christ\u201d explains the means by which God reconciled sinners to himself. He did that by means of his Son\u2019s saving work in life and in death.\n2 Corinthians 5:18-19 provides context for that phrase: \u201cAll this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting people\u2019s sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Global warming", "completion": "I've asked this question twice in the past with disappointing responses. Why doesn't WELS have an official statement regarding \"Global Warming\"?  The same scientists who tells us that global warming is destroying the earth also tell us that the world is billions of years old, the universe was created by the \"big bang,\u201d and that all life on earth evolved from a single celled organism from a puddle of mud.  That's not what we as WELS Christians believe or confess in the Apostles' or Nicene Creed.  So why are you so afraid to take a stance regarding \"global warming\"?  I was taught and believe that God controls everything, including all of the weather...good, bad and otherwise.  Didn't God question Job and ask him if he knew where the storehouses were for the thunder and lightning, rain and snow?  I don't think God said that he reserves the hail for times of trouble, unless \"global warming\" interrupts his plans.  Does the WELS support the doctrine of man-made global warming?\n\n\nI am sorry, but you may be disappointed with this response as well. A \u201cdoctrine of man-made global warming\u201d is not a biblical doctrine. The subject matter is not one that Scripture addresses.\nThe Bible does speak of disasters (for example, Matthew 24:7), and there are passages that speak in a general way about our stewardship of God\u2019s creation (Genesis 1 and 2). Since the Bible does not address the subject matter of your question, you will not find a statement from WELS regarding it.\nWhen there are biblical doctrines involved, you will find official statements of our church body in the \u201cDoctrinal Statements\u201d section of this website."}
{"prompt": "Last rites", "completion": "Why the term last rites, last prayers?\n\n\n\u201cLast rites\u201d is a term associated with the Roman Catholic Church. When a member of that church is seriously ill, a priest might minister to the individual with penance, the Lord\u2019s Supper and the anointing of the sick.

{"prompt": "Jesus and Israel", "completion": "You recently had a family devotion about God's plan under daily devotions on Isaiah 49:5-6.  It said this was a conversation between God the Father and Jesus the Son. How do we come to this conclusion when verse 3 says the servant is Israel?\n\n\nAs the promised Messiah, Jesus went by many different names and titles in the Old Testament. \u201cIsrael\u201d in Isaiah 49:3 is one of those names. Calling the Messiah by that name underscores the means by which God sent the promised Savior into the world: Jesus, the eternal Son of God, came into the world and took on human flesh as a descendant of Jacob (Matthew 1:1-2; Luke 3:34)."}
{"prompt": "Prayer for deliverance", "completion": "Having been chosen by God, we of course are given the peace of knowing eventually we\u2019ll be in heaven, regardless of what happens on earth. But while we are on earth, especially those of us who are young and have quite a while, do those people less fortunate in terms of physical and mental well-being have any teachings to rest their hope on?  I do understand that good things come out of bad situations.  We can learn and use them to help others and learn to rest on God instead of earthly things. But I\u2019m wondering, when we pray persistently and faithfully that, if it is his will, he delivers us from whatever kind of suffering or poverty we may be facing, is that something we have any scriptural grounds to be hopeful for when we pray for that? Or is it something we shouldn\u2019t focus on? A lot of devotions I see focus on having hope for after we die as an answer to our earthly suffering. While I plan to continuously stay reminded of that, at the same time, I want to know how I should approach and view the here and now too. I\u2019ve been trying to understand verses such as Jeremiah 29:11, Romans 12:12, 1 Peter\u202c \u202d5:10. Thank you.\n\n\nPrayer is a great privilege Christians have. Through prayer, we can communicate with God. That communication can include petitions, requests, that we present to God. \u201cCan we pray for deliverance from temporal suffering or poverty?\u201d you ask. We certainly can.\nThink of the last petition in the Lord\u2019s Prayer: \u201cDeliver us from evil.\u201d Luther explained the petition this way in his Catechism: \u201cIn conclusion, we pray in this petition that our Father in heaven would deliver us from every evil that threatens body and soul, property and reputation, and finally when our last hour comes, grant us a blessed end and graciously take us from this world of sorrow to himself in heaven.\u201d In that petition of the Lord\u2019s Prayer, we ask for final deliverance from this world of sin, but we also pray for deliverance from earthly troubles before death takes place. Since we do not know what God might have in mind for us, we pray with the attitude and words of \u201cyour will be done.\u201d\n2 Thessalonians 3:2 gives us an example of someone praying for deliverance from earthly troubles. In fact, the apostle Paul was requesting the prayers of fellow believers for that purpose. We find a similar request in Romans 15:31. Matthew 26:39 informs us that Jesus prayed to his heavenly Father for the \u201ccup of suffering\u201d to be removed from his life. But he prayed, \u201cYet not as I will, but as you will.\u201d\nJeremiah 29:11 is often taken out of context. The verse contains a specific promise made to the exiles who were in Babylon. Romans 12:12 encourages us to be \u201cpatient in affliction and faithful in prayer.\u201d Such prayer can also include requests for God to alleviate or remove our affliction, if that is his will. 1 Peter 5:10 reminds us that our earthly troubles are temporary; a glorious future awaits.\nSo, keep offering \u201cpetitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving\u201d to God (1 Timothy 2:1). Be assured that God hears and answers all the prayers of his children."}
{"prompt": "Anxiety and depression", "completion": "Are anxiety and depression considered sins for Christians? What is the WELS biblical position about anxiety and depression for people coping with chronic physical and emotional pain and who may suffer from mental illness?  While we never would excuse sin, how are we to view it if we or another we know of struggles with anxiety (to the point of involuntary anxiety disorders such as panic attacks) and/or difficult emotion regulation with depression, etc.? \n\n\nThe meaning of the First Commandment is that we \u201cfear, love, and trust in God above all things.\u201d As human beings, we fall short of doing what God commands. Our violations of all the other commandments illustrate that.\nWorry is a lack of trust in God. Jesus instructed his followers not to worry (Matthew 6:25-34). Through the apostle Paul, God instructed the Christians in Philippi not to be anxious (Philippians 4:6). While worry is a sin, worry can also be a symptom of mental illness. When that is the case, people are not freed from accountability; the presence of a mental illness can provide explanation for the worrying that takes place. Certainly, counseling with one\u2019s pastor and receiving help from medical and mental health professionals is in order.\nDepression is a mood disorder. \u201cThe cause of depression can be physiological, psychological, or spiritual, or any combination of these. Poor eating and sleeping habits or a lack of exercise can also cause depression, or they might be the result of depression. A serious loss, anger turned inward, or guilt that remains unresolved can all cause depression.\u201d That quote is from page nine of a book titled Pressed Down But Not Forgotten. It is a good resource on the subject of depression. Your pastor or church library may have a copy.\nYour questions draw attention to some of the problems people have been experiencing since sin\u2019s entrance into the world in the Garden of Eden. Thanks be to God that through his gospel he provides forgiveness for all our sins and strength for Christian living.\nYour questions also deserve a more thorough response than can be provided here.

{"prompt": "Faith, Baptism and salvation", "completion": "I'm not baptized yet. I seek Baptism. I want to be baptized and receive Communion, but due to Covid and other circumstances, I can't just jump up and get baptized. So here's my conundrum: I believe in the One whom the Father sent into the world. I believe that Jesus is Lord, that He died for my sin, and that God raised him up from the dead\u2013 the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. I again say that I have faith in God's Son, his grace, his mercy, and I try to keep his commandments because of my faith.\r\nDespite my faith, I am unbaptized. Am I in error to say to others or myself, \u201cI am saved\u201d? I'm not asking if I will be saved if I die before Baptism. I'm asking if right now, at this very moment, am I saved?\r\nForgive my repetition. I believe the Gospel and want to be baptized. Jesus is Lord, the eternal Son of God. I confess my sins in prayer and try to proclaim Christ crucified when able. Am I saved or unsaved?\r\n\n\n\nThe Bible teaches that faith in Jesus Christ saves and unbelief condemns (Mark 16:16). Baptism is necessary in the sense that Jesus instructs us to administer it. Baptism is not absolutely necessary in that the Holy Spirit can create saving faith through the word of God alone. Your words tell me that is your situation.\nWhen I read your words, I think of Romans 10:9-10 \u2013 \u201cIf you declare with your mouth, \u2018Jesus is Lord,\u2019 and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.\u201d Your words describe a person who confesses saving faith in Jesus Christ.\nI do not know what other circumstances besides Covid concerns might be delaying your Baptism, but I would encourage you to contact one of our pastors. He will be able to minister to you in a safe manner. Baptism will give you a second guarantee\u2014in addition to the Word of God alone\u2014of God\u2019s forgiveness of all your sins.

{"prompt": "Free will and God", "completion": "I have been struggling recently with free will vs. God being in control of all things and nothing happens that he does not already know. How can I have free will if God already knows what I am going to do and how my life is going to turn out? Any additional resources, books, or sermons on this topic would be appreciated as well. Thanks!\n\n\nEver since the fall into sin in Eden, the free will that people have is limited to making decisions about their earthly lives. So, people choose to marry or remain single, enter into this or that vocation, live in a certain area, etc. Of course, when it comes to making decisions like those, people may not always get what they want.\nAfter the fall into sin, people by nature can choose only evil in the spiritual realm. \u201cThe mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God\u2019s law, nor can it do so\u201d (Romans 8:7). \u201cEvery inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time\u201d (Genesis 6:5). \u201cEvery inclination of the human heart is evil from childhood\u201d (Genesis 8:21). Because of natural sin and unbelief, people are God\u2019s enemies; they want to do only that which displeases God.\nAs a child of God, my free will is much different than before my conversion. Now my new self wants to use the means of grace to strengthen my faith; now I want to follow God\u2019s law as a tangible way of showing my thankfulness to him for my salvation in Jesus his Son. However, even when I, as a child of God, want to do those things in life that are good and godly, I recognize that it is God working in me: \u201cIt is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose\u201d (Philippians 2:13).\nAs Christians, you and I have much freedom when it comes to making everyday decisions in our lives. We can choose this, we can reject that. Does God know what we are going to do? Certainly. God knows all things, but \u201cGod\u2019s foreknowledge is not causative,\u201d Lutheran theologians say. The fact that God knows in advance what will happen does not mean that God forces people into that action.\nThere are a few pages in the following two books from the People\u2019s Bible Teaching series that address your question: Man and God\u2019s Providence. Chapter five of The Narrow Lutheran Middle provides more detail. Finally, the \u201cWill of Man\u201d section in Volume III of What Luther Says contains information on \u201cfree will\u201d (Luther calls it \u201cself-will\u201d). Your pastor or church library may have that last book."}
{"prompt": "God's elect", "completion": "Who are God's elect?\n\n\nThe elect are those whom God graciously chose before the creation of the world to be his children forever (Ephesians 1:4-6; Romans 8:29-30). Through the gospel, God brings those whom he has elected to saving faith in Jesus Christ and preserves them in the faith. Election demonstrates that people are not in any way responsible for their salvation; God\u2019s grace is the reason for their salvation (Romans 11:5-6).\nOne of our hymns addresses the subject this way: \u201cFrom eternity, O God, In Your Son you did elect me. Therefore, Father, on life\u2019s road Graciously to heav\u2019n direct me; Send to me your Holy Spirit That his gifts I may inherit.\u201d (Christian Worship 461:1) What blessings from our Triune God!"}

{"prompt": "Death and messages", "completion": "The mother-in-law of a young man, who died tragically in a farm accident and left a wife and three young children behind, said that she talked to a friend of hers who has received a message from the young man who died. She wants to give the message to his parents.  The father called me  and wanted to know if he should listen to the message.  I told him to hear the message with a great deal of skepticism because the devil can use many different ways to deceive us and give us a false hope. Are there other parts of Scripture, other than Isaiah 8:19, I could direct him to?    \n\n\nAnother part of Scripture to which I could direct your attention is the account of the rich man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31). The rich man who died and went to hell wanted to get a message to his brothers on earth to warn them about the place of suffering he was experiencing. His request was denied. His brothers did not need any special messages or messengers because Scripture was available to them (Luke 16:29-31). The Bible explains how to avoid hell and, instead, experience eternal joys in heaven (Mark 16:16).\nWhen death takes place, judgment also takes place (Ecclesiastes 12:7; Hebrews 9:27). The souls of Christians go to heaven, while the souls of unbelievers go to hell (Luke 16:22-23). On the Last Day, Jesus will make public the judgments that took place when people died; he will also render judgment on those who are alive on the earth when he returns (Matthew 25:31-46; 2 Timothy 4:1)."}

{"prompt": "Living in the end times", "completion": "What does God want Christians to do during end times? Please list all biblical references. \n\n\nChristians have been living in the end times or \u201clast days\u201d (Hebrews 1:2) since Jesus\u2019 earthly ministry concluded. Since God\u2019s will does not change, that means that God wants us to use life as he instructed his followers in the past.\nHere are some specifics. God wants us to love him first and foremost, and to love our neighbor as ourselves (Matthew 22:27-28). God wants us to pray to him (1 Thessalonians 5:17) and faithfully use his Word (Joshua 1:8; Psalm 122:1). God\u2019s will is that we honor his representatives in the home (Ephesians 6:2-3), the church (Hebrews 13:7, 17) and the government (Romans 13:1, 3, 6). God wants us to protect his gracious gift of life, our only time to come to repentance and saving faith in Jesus (Isaiah 55:6). God\u2019s will is that we avoid sexual immorality (1 Thessalonians 4:3-5). God wants us to recognize that he is the owner of all things (Psalm 24:1). God\u2019s will is that we be truthful in our conversations with others (Colossians 3:9) and content with how he is blessing our lives (1 Timothy 6:6-7).\nThis is the content of the Ten Commandments, isn\u2019t it? This is how God wants Christians to live during the end times. This is how God has always wanted people to live.\nMost importantly, God wants us to \u201cRepent and believe the good news!\u201d (Mark 1:15) He wants us to cling to Jesus in faith until the end of life (Revelation 2:10). He wants us to proclaim his name and share his Word with all people (Matthew 28:19-20). The Lord tells us to be watchful for his visible return on the last day (Matthew 24:42).\nThis was not intended to be an exhaustive list. The intent was really to illustrate what the first paragraph stated\u2014that God\u2019s will for Christians now is the same as his will for people in years past. This is no surprise. After God, God says, \u201cI the LORD do not change\u201d (Malachi 3:6)."}
{"prompt": "Jesus and temptation", "completion": "If Jesus was truly man and truly God, was he born with original sin, and if not, could he have sinned?  I note that Adam was created without sin, yet he chose to sin.  Jesus was born of God and Man, yet he was tempted by Satan in the wilderness.  Could he have sinned at that time, or was it not possible for him to sin since he was also true God?\n\n\nJesus was not born with original sin. He had no sinful nature. \u201cFlesh gives birth to flesh,\u201d Jesus said (John 3:6). Sinful parents have sinful children. Jesus was \u201cconceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary,\u201d as we confess in the Apostles\u2019 Creed. That miraculous conception enabled Jesus to become man without having a sinful nature (Luke 1:35).\nWhen it comes to Jesus and temptation, I can point you to an article that appeared in the Wisconsin Lutheran Quarterly. The article is worth your time. Below are some thoughts from the conclusion of the article:\n\u201cOn the basis of a well-meant desire to affirm the authenticity of Christ\u2019s temptations some Christians have asserted that it was theoretically possible for Christ to have sinned. When the question is raised how it would have been possible for Christ to have sinned if he was truly God, the answer is usually that Jesus could have sinned only in his human nature, not in his divine nature. To claim that Jesus or his human nature could have sinned without God sinning requires that Jesus\u2019 humanity had an existence separate from God. Jesus, then, is not truly God. He is just a man inhabited or possessed by God in a special way, much like a person possessed by the devil. When we limit Christ\u2019s actions to one of his natures rather than his person, we destroy the unity of his person and end up with a Nestorian Christ, one whose two natures are just glued together like boards and which can be pulled apart. If we accept this principle, then it follows that his death was simply the death of his human nature, not the death of God\u2019s Son, that is, the death of God. Jesus certainly could not have been tempted if he had no human nature, just as he could not die without a human nature. But both of these were acts of the person, just as all his acts for our salvation were.\n\u201cFor Jesus to sin would have meant either that God sinned or that the personal union was broken. Biblical Christology allows neither of these possibilities.\u201d\nJesus was \u201ctempted in every way, just as we are\u2014yet was without sin\u201d (Hebrews 4:15). Jesus was perfect in our place. He did what we cannot do: he rejected temptation. Because we fail to reject temptation and avoid sin, Jesus suffered the punishment we deserved.\nJesus lived up to his name, which means \u201cSavior,\u201d by living a holy life in our place and suffering the punishment our sins deserved. Jesus\u2019 active obedience (his holy life) and passive obedience (his sacrificial death) were both necessary for our salvation.\nYou can find the article I cited here."}

{"prompt": "Son and Judaism", "completion": "My son was raised in a Christian home, went to Lutheran grade school, high school and college. He has now rejected Jesus and is practicing Judaism. He says there is no hell, no salvation. Life is about making the world a better place. I know praying is the most powerful thing I can do, but I don't even know what to say to him or how to approach him about this.\n\n\nYes, continue to pray for your son; I will do the same. Also, continue to be a Christian influence in his life. Godly examples reinforce Christian witnessing, and your son needs both. See what you and others in your family and circle of friends might do to keep the gospel of Christ in your son\u2019s life. It could be simple things like emails or text messages that contain Bible passages. We never know what God might do with those things.\nAs far as approaching your son about this change in his life, you can determine what to say to him by asking him questions. You might think of pursuing questions like these: When did he start having second thoughts about Jesus and the Christian faith? Were there any circumstances or events in his life that led to questioning his faith? Were there influential people in his life who played a role in his embracing Judaism? What finally led him to reject Jesus and the Christian faith?\nI wonder also if one of our pastors is in a position to speak to your son. If that is an option, please consider that route.\nWe know that God changes hearts through his powerful gospel (Romans 1:16). At some point, it would be good for your son to read through the book of Hebrews. That book clearly and repeatedly shows how Jesus Christ is far superior to anything associated with Judaism. You and I won\u2019t be able to convince your son of that truth, but the Holy Spirit can.\nFinally, use your pastor as a resource person. Explain to him what you learn about your son\u2019s change of heart and see how he might be able to assist you in future conversations with your son.\nIt certainly sounds like you did what you could as a Christian parent: raising your son in a Christian environment and enabling him to receive a Christian education for many years. Your son is responsible for the life he is now leading. Like the father in the parable of the lost son (Luke 15:11-32), you stand ready and willing to receive your son back into the fold of God\u2019s family. God shares that same attitude. God bless all that you and others do for your son, that he may again confess Jesus as Savior and enjoy every blessing won by his holy life and sacrificial death."}
{"prompt": "Heaven and relationships", "completion": "I know that when you go to heaven you are no longer married. However, once you are in heaven, does that mean that you will no longer have the desire for a relationship with someone that you might have had feelings for while on earth?\n\n\n1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 describes Jesus returning visibly to this world with those who died in the faith and then gathering them together with his followers who are alive on the earth. From that moment on, Christians \u201cwill be with the Lord forever\u201d (verse 17). Other parts of Scripture provide general information about the unending life we will share with God and other Christians, but specifics are lacking.\nWhat can be said with certainty is that in eternity our love for others will be perfect and God will be the object of our greatest love (as is to be the case now, according to the First Commandment). We will enjoy perfect relationships with one another. We will not fully comprehend what this amounts to until the Lord gathers the Church to himself.\nAnticipating these relationships is another reason why the Church responds to Jesus\u2019 declaration that he is \u201ccoming soon\u201d with \u201cAmen. Come, Lord Jesus.\u201d (Revelation 22:20)"}
{"prompt": "Women in church", "completion": "What is the role of women in church, and why can't women be pastors?\r\n\r\n\n\n\nYour questions require more extensive responses than can be provided through this question and answer service.

{"prompt": "Speaking to pastor", "completion": "If I see that my pastor is negligent in his duties every day of the week besides Sunday (always letting phone calls go to his voicemail, not calling/visiting shut-ins monthly, not having hymns and texts chosen well in advance of the service, not reviewing forms given to him to complete, not showing up for church cleaning or decorating days), do I have the right to tell him he ought to do more for our congregation? I am a single woman, and our elders and congregation president are hesitant to discuss this problem with him. I\u2019ve prayed for him to change, but nothing has changed.\n\n\nCertainly, if you have concerns about your pastor\u2019s ministry, do speak to him. Such a conversation will enable you to pass along your observations and receive your pastor\u2019s explanations. If conversations like this with your pastor do not bring about resolution, then there is opportunity to speak to church leaders such as the ones you mentioned. They would then need to speak to your pastor.\nBecause your concerns appear to be about faithfulness, let me pass along these thoughts. While God has high standards and requirements for those who would serve him in the public ministry (1 Timothy 3:1-7; Titus 1:6-9), faithfulness is all-important (1 Corinthians 4:2). Pastors are to be faithful in their ministries and faithful in all areas of life\u2014including their personal and family life. Congregations help their pastors when they encourage their pastors to be faithful and assist them in growing in their faithfulness.\nOne way of providing encouragement and assistance is through a \u201ccare committee for called workers.\u201d I do not know if your congregation has such a committee. If you want more information, you and your congregation\u2019s leaders can find resources here. A care committee for called workers provides a forum for regular communication between called workers and congregational representatives so that concerns such as the ones you listed can be addressed and resolved.\nContinue praying for your pastor. One of our hymns contains a nice prayer for pastors and congregations. \u201cKeep pastors faithful, strong, and true, Not working for themselves but you. Endow them with the grace they need, The lambs to serve, the sheep to feed, The precious flock to lead and guide\u2014The Shepherd thus is glorified. May all your people faithful be And treat your pastors rev\u2019rently And with them work and for them pray, Rememb\u2019ring what the Scriptures say: Receive the prophet of the Lord and gain the prophet\u2019s own reward.\u201d (Christian Worship 548:2-3) God\u2019s blessings to you and your congregation."}
{"prompt": "Sober-minded", "completion": "Thank you for the great answer given earlier on this site to a person wondering about whether or not they could use marijuana in a God-pleasing way. However, in addition to the encouragement of being sober-minded, couldn\u2019t we also speak strongly against getting high as being a sin also?  By getting high I mean purposely taking marijuana with high doses of THC with the intent of getting high, in the same way a person drinks to excess to get drunk?  Let\u2019s face it, many take the drug for that reason.  Thank you for considering this added element of the question for me.\n\n\nThere are two questions on the website that address the use of marijuana, so I am not sure which question and answer you are specifically addressing with your comments and question. Both responses warn against actions that dull a person\u2019s senses and lead to loss of self-control. As we can see sin in those actions, your \u201cadded element\u201d is certainly an appropriate emphasis to the previously-posted questions and answers. Thank you for passing that along."}
{"prompt": "Reading Leviticus", "completion": "As we are reading through Leviticus, why do you think God wanted us to learn about all of their laws at that time?  I always have a hard time going through that part of the Bible.\n\n\nI can imagine that you speak for many Christians, so thank you for your question.\nMy sainted uncle wrote a Bible study book on Leviticus titled Shadows of Christ. He wrote this in the Preface: \u201cWhy should we study the Book of Leviticus? To many, a study of this book will appear but remotely profitable. On the surface it may appear as valuable as walking through a veil into a room of archaic objects\u2014just vestiges of a former age and a form of worship that has completed its usefulness. Leviticus, as properly and commonly understood, is the Law of ceremonies and rites for the Church in the Old Testament. Yet, if we examine the book carefully, we can see that Leviticus has the story of man\u2019s salvation to tell in its own way.\n\u201cIf we can appreciate that the ancient Egyptians expressed themselves admirably through hieroglyphics, then we will also appreciate the fact that the Lord in His own way can communicate and foretell the world\u2019s redemption in picture form, or through Old Testament ceremonies. St. Paul, it is true, calls the ceremonies and the calendar of ancient Israel \u2018shadows,\u2019 but he never said: \u2018Don\u2019t investigate them.\u2019 We are going to visit the old rooms of the Tabernacle (Temple) and brush away the dust. When we study these vestiges of a former age, we discover that the shadows lead to Christ. They present an amazingly precise account of salvation through faith in Christ the Crucified.\u201d\nThe Foreword to Connecting Sinai to Calvary highlights the importance of Leviticus with these words: \u201cIn years past, Leviticus was the first Bible book read by children in a Jewish family. Unfortunately, Leviticus is the last book most Christians read. At what cost? They won\u2019t be able to understand as well as they ought the comparisons between the Old Testament priest and Christ, our great High Priest\u2026They are likely to miss all the New Testament connections to the ceremony the people of Israel witnessed each year on the great Day of Atonement. That day\u2019s high point occurred when the high priest stepped out of the sanctuary, hands red from having been dipped into a container of animal blood\u2014at least 28 times. In plain view of all the worshipers, he wiped those bloody hands on the head of a goat, which was then led out into the desert to die. Leviticus chapter 16 gives us this graphic portrayal of Christ as the sin bearer. To overlook such details surely detracts from one\u2019s understanding of how God forgives sin.\u201d\nYou and other Bible readers would also benefit by supplementing your reading of Leviticus with The People\u2019s Bible commentary for Leviticus.\nI hope these thoughts provide encouragement for reading Leviticus."}
{"prompt": "Attitude toward evildoers", "completion": "Is it wrong to want evil people to suffer in hell? After reading about some extremely horrific sexual atrocities committed against children by Nazis during the Holocaust, I feel so much disgust that I can\u2019t imagine justice for the victims if the souls of the perpetrators are not in hell. I thought I read somewhere in the Bible a passage regarding angels and others rejoicing while seeing sinners in hell, but I\u2019m not sure where it is. Does the feeling of wanting the most evil among us who hurt, abuse, and murder children to suffer in hell make me a bad person and not a Christian?\n\n\nGod\u2019s will is that people enjoy forgiveness of sins and eternal life through repentance and faith in his Son, Jesus Christ (1 Timothy 2:4; 2 Peter 3:9). God\u2019s will is also that those who reject him receive the punishment they deserve (Mark 16:16).\nChildren of God understand that difference between the law and the gospel when they seek to spread the message of God\u2019s love (John 3:16) to all people (Matthew 28:19-20) and when they ask that God punish evildoers (Psalm 35; Revelation 6:10). Martin Luther made this observation: \u201cTherefore no one can pray the Lord\u2019s Prayer correctly without cursing. For when he prays: \u2018Hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,\u2019 he must put all the opposition to this on one pile and say: \u2018Curses, maledictions, and disgrace upon every other name and every other kingdom! May they be ruined and torn apart, and may all their schemes and wisdom and plans run aground.\u2019\u201d (Luther\u2019s Works, Volume 21, Page 101)\nWhen Christians align their will with God\u2019s in asking that evildoers be punished, they want to avoid any personal animosity on their part that might jeopardize their own forgiveness from God (Matthew 6:15; Ephesians 4:31). Christians want to let God be the Judge of people\u2019s hearts.\nAs Christians, we recognize that this earthly life is a person\u2019s only time to be brought to repentance and saving faith in Jesus Christ (2 Corinthians 6:2). That is why we do what we can to spread the gospel and support the spread of the gospel. Finally, it is God\u2019s will and ours that those who ultimately reject God receive justice from God and not love.\nI am wondering if the Bible passage you have in mind is this: \u201cIn the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents\u201d (Luke 15:10). Imagine the angels\u2019 ongoing joy!"}
{"prompt": "Attitude toward father", "completion": "My father was verbally, emotionally, and physically abusive to me.  I was the scapegoat and my brother the golden child.  Yet, my father faithfully attended Lutheran church, tithed, and volunteered at church to assist the sick/elderly etc.  I finally cut off contact 25 years ago to stop the abuse.  I basically had no feelings one way or the other toward him, mainly just disappointment.  If something had happened to my brother, I would have always done right by my father and helped him with medical care, etc. if necessary because that is the type of person I am.  Now he has died and I found out that, in a trust and will he made years before my cutting off contact, he has left everything to my brother, even any and all personal household items.  It seems as if his lifetime of abuse and rejection of me is complete.  Given this, I wonder if such a person is now in heaven?  I know no one is perfect and that one can repent at the last minute etc., but I am truly tormented by this situation.\n\n\nThere is no question your experiences have been very challenging. It was saddening to read about them. Thanks be to God that he remains your refuge and strength (Psalm 46:1) even in the most difficult situations in life.\nGod alone, of course, knows the answer to your question. You understand correctly that God, through his word, can change hearts\u2014even as this life is coming to a close. When there is saving faith, even the weakest of faith, in the heart at death, there is the enjoyment of the forgiveness of sins and eternal life. If unbelief fills the heart at death, there is an eternity of separation from God in hell.\nYour self-acknowledged attitudes toward your father have gone from disappointment to being tormented. Anger would not be an unusual attitude for a person in your situation; appealing to God\u2019s justice would not be a rare request. In responding to your question (\u201cI wonder if such a person is now in heaven?\u201d), I also have to bring in the subjects of God\u2019s love and repentant sinners. Again, only God knows what judgment your father faced at his death. While I do not in any way want to be insensitive to the pain you have endured, I do have to ask this: Wouldn\u2019t it be a reason to praise God if your father died in repentance and saving faith rather than dying in impenitence and unbelief, and spending eternity in hell? Because of his sins, your father certainly deserved punishment from a holy God, but it is a gracious God who \u201cdoes not treat us as our sins deserve\u201d (Psalm 103:10). And it is a gracious God who works repentance and saving faith in the heart to enjoy the forgiveness of sins Jesus won by his holy life and sacrificial death. I write this in response to your question about the possibility of your father being in heaven.\nWhat I cannot do in a few paragraphs is help you resolve these matters. You would really benefit by speaking with your pastor or another trusted Christian counselor. A face-to-face setting like that would enable you to pour out your heart, ask more questions and then receive more complete guidance from God\u2019s word. I encourage you to initiate that conversation. God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Free will and faith", "completion": "Can you define \u201cfree will\u201d from a Lutheran standpoint and everything that it entails? Do we have free will truly? And could you give some back up to the idea that it\u2019s the Holy Spirit\u2019s work in us and not our choice to follow God?\n\n\nEver since the fall into sin in the Garden of Eden, people\u2019s free will is limited to making decisions about their earthly lives. So, people decide what vocation they might undertake in life, where they will live\u2014things like that.\nAfter the fall into sin, people by nature can choose only evil in the spiritual realm; they cannot choose to establish a relationship with God. The Bible explains: \u201cThe mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God\u2019s law, nor can it do so\u201d (Romans 8:7). \u201cEvery inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time\u201d (Genesis 6:5). \u201cEvery inclination of the human heart is evil from childhood\u201d (Genesis 8:21). Because of natural sin and unbelief, people are God\u2019s enemies; they want to do only that which displeases God.\nNow as a child of God, my free will is much different than before my conversion. Now my new self wants to use the means of grace to strengthen my faith; now I want to follow God\u2019s law as a tangible way of showing my thankfulness to him for my salvation in Jesus his Son. However, even when I, as a child of God, want to do those things in life that are good and godly, I recognize that it is God working in me: \u201cIt is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose\u201d (Philippians 2:13).\nThe Bible makes it very clear that faith is the Holy Spirit\u2019s work and not ours. What Jesus first said to his disciples applies to all Christians: \u201cYou did not choose me, but I chose you\u2026\u201d (John 15:16) 1 Corinthians 12:3 states that it is only because of the Holy Spirit\u2019s work that people are able to confess Jesus Christ as their Savior. Ephesians 2:8 speaks of faith as \u201cthe gift of God.\u201d Philippians 1:29 describes how people are on the receiving end of God\u2019s gift of faith: \u201cFor it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him\u2026\u201d Colossians 2:12 describes faith as \u201cthe working of God.\u201d\nHow thankful we are that the Holy Spirit did what we cannot do. Through the gospel (Romans 10:17), the Holy Spirit connects us to Jesus Christ in saving faith so that we enjoy all the blessings he won by his holy life and sacrificial death."}

Of Good Works (Page 801 in the Concordia Triglotta) and the Formula of Concord. Thorough Declaration. IV. Of Good Works (Page 947 in the Concordia Triglotta).\nMartin Luther taught from Scripture that salvation can be lost. Here is a sampling of his words: \u201cWhen the Gospel begins to assert its influence, everybody wants to become a Christian. All seems well, and everybody is pleased. But when a wind or rainstorm of temptation comes on, people fall away in droves.\u201d \u201cThe Evangelist John has put this down [the account in John 6:59-60 of many followers of the Lord stumbling over his teachings] for our comfort that it may serve us as an illustration and we may know that if the Gospel runs its true course in the world, even those fall away from it of whom one had not expected it and who ought to do their best for it. The fact that Christ acts so weakly in His ministry towards His own that one falls away here and another there has dealt me many a blow, as, on the other hand, has the fact that the devil develops such great strength and opposes the Gospel with all his might so that the best people in the world persecute it and among us also the best fall away from it completely.\u201d [What Luther Says, Volume I, pages 37-38]\nBecause Christian faith is under attack, Luther offered this prayer in a hymn: \u201cDefend your truth, O God, and stay This evil generation, And from the error of its way Keep your own congregation. The wicked ev\u2019rywhere abound And would your little flock confound, But you are our salvation!\u201d (Christian Worship 205:4)"}
{"prompt": "Degrees of glory", "completion": "Are there levels of heaven?\n\n\nAllow me to pass along excerpts of an article I worked up a few years ago for Forward in Christ. The article addressed your question.\n\u201cYour question provides the opportunity to marvel at the gracious love of God Christians enjoy in equal measure and in unique ways.\n\u201c\u2026Our works do not contribute in any way to our salvation (Titus 3:5,6). The salvation we enjoy is God\u2019s doing.\n\u201cMore than that, the salvation you and I enjoy is what all Christians possess. The book of Revelation illustrates that well. In one vision, the apostle John describes Christians who had been killed for their faith being given \u2018a white robe\u2019 (6:11). The garment represents the robe of righteousness Jesus won and which people \u201cwear\u201d through faith in him. Each of those martyrs received a white robe. Some did not receive half a robe; others, two robes. All enjoyed salvation equally. Jesus\u2019 parable of the workers in the vineyard (Matthew 20:1-16) also teaches that God\u2019s children equally enjoy his salvation.\n\u201cWhile all Christians enjoy the same gift of salvation, Scripture speaks of God customizing his gracious blessings.\n\u201cRather than speaking of levels of heaven (as the Mormons do), we understand Bible passages like Daniel 12:3; Matthew 25:23,28,29; Luke 19:17,19; 1 Corinthians 3:12-15; 2 Corinthians 9:6; and Revelation 14:13 to address the subject of \u2018degrees of glory.\u2019 That expression describes the individual blessings God will graciously bestow on his followers in connection with their faithful earthly lives. We will have to wait to see what that specifically means.\n\u201cWhat it means now is that we do not serve the Lord with the idea of getting something from him in the future\u2026Such an attitude can easily plague Christians.\n\u201cI once had a number of conversations with a person who was interested in joining the church I served. The person\u2019s profession of faith and our church\u2019s statement of belief matched until she brought up \u2018once saved, always saved.\u2019 In spite of citing Bible passages that speak of people falling from faith (for example, Matthew 13:20,21; 1 Timothy 1:19), she regarded apostasy as an impossibility. Hypothetically conceding to her position, I asked what reason she had to attend worship services in church. Her answer made everything clear: \u2018To get more jewels in my crown.\u2019\n\u201cNow I got it. Her stated motive for doing God\u2019s will was to get something in return. That is an attitude we need to reject. Any way that God chooses to bless our Spirit-driven lives of love (Philippians 2:13) is grace. Pure grace.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Paycheck Protection Program and giving", "completion": "I am aware of WELS congregations applying for and accepting government PPP payments.  How can this be viewed as Gospel motivated giving?\n\n\nOne of the programs of the CARES (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security) Act was the Paycheck Protection Program. It was \u201cdesigned to keep small businesses, including qualifying non-profit organizations, afloat during mandated Coronavirus Disease 2019 (\u2018COVID-19\u2019) related closures.\u201d The program provided potentially forgivable loans for small businesses, which included nonprofit organizations like churches. Each WELS congregation had the responsibility of determining whether or not to participate in that program. Below is information that WELS shared with called workers in April 2020:\n\u201cOne program under the CARES Act receiving quite a bit of attention is the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Under the PPP, certain businesses, including nonprofit organizations (which would include WELS congregations and WELS affiliated ministries) may be eligible to receive a potentially forgivable loan through the Small Business Administration (SBA). Generally, the loans are for the lessor of $10,000,000 or 2.5 times the 2019 average monthly payroll cost. PPP loans may be helpful to nonprofit organizations by providing money to those organizations to pay for certain qualifying expenses, such as payroll costs for called and hired workers who are still employed, mortgage and rent payments, and utility costs.\n\u201cWe do not view this as a dependence on the government for carrying out ministry; rather it should be viewed as a type of restitution to compensate for financial hardships resulting from government actions to mitigate the spread of the infection.\n\u201cWe also encourage all of our members to realize that financial assistance from the government is not a substitute for faithful Christian stewardship. Please remember to support your congregation\u2019s ministry and called workers with your faithful offerings, even if you are not able to gather for worship.\u201d\nAnother provision of the CARES Act provides charitable contribution incentives. That provision created a new \u201cabove the line\u201d deduction (i.e. for taxpayers who take the standard deduction).

{"prompt": "Lord's Supper practices", "completion": "I am interested in the history of the practice of Holy Communion in the WELS I experienced as a child, versus today.  When I was young, members who chose not to take Holy Communion would be ushered out, then the service of Holy Communion would begin.  When/why did that practice change, to now including it as part of the entire worship service?\n\n\nWhat you experienced was not a synod-wide practice. Then, as now, local congregations made revisions to long-standing worship practices. Some congregations acquiesced to worshipers who left before the celebration of the Lord\u2019s Supper by providing an early Benediction for them. Other congregations intentionally brought the Holy Communion service to an end before the consecration and distribution of the elements, and ushered out those worshipers who were not communing. The worshipers who remained often participated in an \u201cOrder of the Confessional Service\u201d and then the reception of the Lord\u2019s Supper.\nRecognizing the use of opening and closing hymns, liturgical worship services\u2014with or without the Lord\u2019s Supper\u2014begin with the Invocation and end with the Benediction. Hymnals, then and now, reflected that structure of the worship service. Your question tells me you are seeing more consistent implementation of that structure today."}

{"prompt": "Luther translation", "completion": "In a recent answer, you quote Martin Luther lamenting \"the fact that Christ acts so weakly in His ministry towards His own...\".  Did Luther actually write this, or is it perhaps a bad translation?  It doesn't sound like the author of \"A Mighty Fortress Is Our God.\"  Thank you for your response.\n\n\nIt is an accurate translation. Perhaps the words that follow the previous quotation can provide greater meaning. In commenting on the fact that people can fall away from the faith, Luther continued: \u201cAt times thoughts such as these are bound to occur to a person: If you please, is this teaching really right? In view of this strange showing, is God doing well?\n\u201cThis causes great offense. But we must absolutely close our eyes and say: Let fall who will not stand and stand who stands; let him who will persecute the Gospel persecute it, it is nonetheless the truth. This is not a surprise, for Christ Himself had the same experience. What can I do if the pope and the enthusiasts fall away from the Gospel and inflict great pain on us? My lot will be no better than that of my Lord. Since they fell away from Him, why should they stand by us?\u201d (What Luther Says, Volume I, 38)\nIt is in the context of Jesus experiencing a falling away of his followers that Luther wrote of the Lord acting \u201cweakly.\u201d Luther\u2019s point was that people have the ability to fall away from the Christian faith, and even the all-powerful Lord experienced that firsthand in his ministry.\nThank you for your careful reading of the question and answer."}
{"prompt": "Communion veil", "completion": "This question actually came from a little girl in my congregation, but I would love to be able to tell her the \u201ccorrect\u201d answer. She asked why we put a cloth over the bread and wine after the Lord\u2019s Supper. The pastor admitted he didn\u2019t have a certain answer. My thoughts are that it is tradition born of necessity. By that I mean that in the first century, when the Lord\u2019s Supper was instituted, there was not central heating and cooling. Covering the elements kept the flies off, and thereby showed respect for the Lord\u2019s Supper and His body and blood.  I think of how the bread in the tabernacle was covered when the Israelites went on the move, too. Is there are more to it than that?\r\nThis is a sharp, observant little lady, maybe about 10 years old, so not yet confirmed. She said after worship she\u2019s been wanting to ask the question for a long time. I\u2019d love to email her parents a link to an answer from an expert!\n\n\nThere are some items in our worship spaces that intentionally convey symbolic meaning. For example, the altar communicates the message of sacrifice to worshipers. It also symbolizes God\u2019s presence among his people. Then, there are other items in our worship spaces into which people have injected symbolic meaning. The veil that covers the Communion vessels is an example of that.\nAs you pointed out, the veil serves the purpose of protecting the vessels and elements from airborne particles. What has happened throughout the years is that people have added symbolic meanings to the practical purpose of the veil. As long as the added meanings are in keeping with biblical truths and do not distract from the meaning of the Lord\u2019s Supper, the symbolism is fine.\nBefore the consecration of the elements can take place, the pastor needs to remove the veil that covers the elements and the vessels. After the distribution of the Lord\u2019s Supper has taken place, the pastor returns the remaining elements and vessels to where they were at the beginning of the service and covers them with the veil.\nThese are the actions that your young friend observed. The actions of the pastor serve practical purposes.\nHow wonderful it will be when your friend can participate in the Lord\u2019s Supper and not merely observe its celebration! Be sure to thank your friend for her question. God\u2019s blessings to you and her."}

Thank you.\n\n\nBecause of the nature of the questions, it is not possible to provide a simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer. The scriptural principle to be applied is that a woman is not to have authority over a man (1 Timothy 2:12). Common application of that principle means that individuals filling the positions you mentioned have governing authority in the church and therefore are men. If a congregation were to remove governing authority from the positions of treasurer or secretary and make those positions service oriented only, it could be possible to go beyond only men filling those positions. Patient instruction would be necessary to avoid confusion and offense.\nWhile not all voting is authoritative, establishing authoritative policies and choosing officers to exercise authority on behalf of the congregation is a responsibility of a congregation\u2019s voting assembly.\nBecause I could not give a simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer to your questions, I would encourage you to read Male and Female in God\u2019s World.

{"prompt": "Reasons for thanksgiving", "completion": "Why can we be thankful?\n\n\nThe Apostles\u2019 Creed, along with Martin Luther\u2019s explanations of the Articles, can go a long way in outlining our reasons for daily thanksgiving to God. The wording of the Creed and the explanations describe the only true God and his workings in our lives.\nMartin Luther\u2019s explanation of the First Article provides reason number one for thanksgiving to God: \u201cI believe that God created me and all that exists, and that he gave me my body and soul, eyes, ears and all my members, my mind and all my abilities.\n\u201cAnd I believe that God still preserves me by richly and daily providing clothing and shoes, food and drink, house and home, spouse and children, land, cattle, and all I own, and all I need to keep my body and life. God also preserves me by defending me against all danger, guarding and protecting me from all evil. All this God does only because he is my good and merciful Father in heaven, and not because I have earned or deserved it. For all this I ought to thank and praise, to serve and obey him.\n\u201cThis is most certainly true.\u201d\nLuther\u2019s explanation of the Second Article provides a second reason for giving thanks to God: \u201cI believe that Jesus Christ, true God, begotten of the Father from eternity, and also true man, born of the virgin Mary, is my Lord.\n\u201cHe has redeemed me, a lost and condemned creature, purchased and won me from all sins, from death and from the power of the devil, not with gold or silver, but with his holy, precious blood and with his innocent suffering and death.\n\u201cAll this he did that I should be his own, and live under him in his kingdom, and serve him in everlasting righteousness, innocence and blessedness, just as he has risen from death and lives and rules eternally.\n\u201cThis is most certainly true.\u201d\nLuther\u2019s explanation of the Third Article gives us a third reason to thank God: \u201cI believe that I cannot by my own thinking or choosing believe in Jesus Christ, my Lord, or come to him.\n\u201cBut the Holy Spirit has called me by the gospel, enlightened me with his gifts, sanctified and kept me in the true faith. In the same way he calls, gathers, enlightens, and sanctifies the whole Christian Church on earth, and keeps it with Jesus Christ in the one true faith.\n\u201cIn this Christian Church he daily and fully forgives all sins to me and all believers.\n\u201cOn the Last Day he will raise me and all the dead, and give eternal life to me and all believers in Christ.\n\u201cThis is most certainly true.\u201d\nWhen we think of who God is and how his love affects our very being and life, we will have reason to do what the psalm writer instructed: \u201cGive thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his love endures forever\u201d (Psalm 106:1)."}
{"prompt": "Jesus and Satan", "completion": "Why do some people say Jesus is Satan? Could this be a form of Satan leading people away from God? \n\n\nNot knowing the context of your questions, I am wondering if the account from Luke 11:14-28 may have shaped them. Historically, that section of the Bible has served as the gospel lesson for the third Sunday in Lent.\nProceeding with that assumption, Luke 11:14-28 describes how the Lord healed a man who was demon possessed and did not have the ability to speak. Reactions from the people who witnessed the miracle varied. Some Pharisees present (Matthew 12:24) said about Jesus, \u201cBy Beelzebul, the prince of demons, he is driving out demons\u201d (Luke 11:15).\nHow could those people utter such an outrageous statement? Keep in mind that people are naturally blind to the truths of Scripture (1 Corinthians 2:14; Ephesians 2:1; Colossians 2:13). In addition, Satan blinds people to the truth about Jesus Christ. Calling him \u201cthe god of this age,\u201d the ruler of this age, the apostle Paul explained that \u201cThe god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel that displays the glory of Christ, who is the image of God\u201d (2 Corinthians 4:4).\nIf people like you and I can confess Jesus Christ as our Savior, it is only because of the work of the Holy Spirit in our hearts (1 Corinthians 12:3). The Holy Spirit opens eyes (Acts 26:18) to see that Jesus Christ is the eternal Son of God, the promised Savior.\nI hope this response addresses the intent of your questions."}

This practice is somewhat troubling to me because I don't know if it is proper.\n\n\nAlmost a year ago, when in-person worship services were not possible, the following information appeared in a WELS Together newsletter: \u201cWe encourage our congregations at this time to reserve the distribution of the Lord\u2019s Supper for its regular and normal use within the gathering of the body of believers (realizing that some changes in procedure may be made) or distributed privately by the pastor to individuals in need, as is the customary practice. We urge congregations to refrain from initiating novel approaches for celebration of the sacrament.\u201d\nA year later, as restrictions are being lifted, in-person reception of the Lord\u2019s Supper in church is available. In addition, as they have in the past, our pastors are happy to offer the Lord\u2019s Supper to individuals privately\u2014in church or in their homes."}
{"prompt": "Third Commandment today", "completion": "What is the New Testament reference to the commandment related to \u201ckeeping holy the Sabbath\u201d (Sunday)?  \n\n\nFor God\u2019s Old Testament people of Israel, the Third Commandment involved a day of the week: Saturday. It was a day that emphasized physical and spiritual rest.\nThe Sabbath day pointed ahead to the perfect rest that the Messiah, Jesus Christ, would provide through the forgiveness of sins (Matthew 11:28-29). Like other parts of the ceremonial law, instructions regarding the Sabbath day are no longer in effect for God\u2019s followers in New Testament times (Colossians 2:16-17). In Christian freedom, followers of the Lord chose Sunday as their primary day for corporate worship; they did so with Jesus\u2019 resurrection in mind. Sunday is not the New Testament Sabbath. Christians are free to worship on any day of the week.\nFor New Testament followers of the Lord, then, the meaning of the Third Commandment is more about the Word of God than a day of the week. The explanation of the commandment in Luther\u2019s Catechism reflects that: \u201cWe should fear and love God that we do not despise preaching and his Word, but regard it as holy and gladly hear and learn it.\u201d\nGathering with fellow Christians for worship services is still important. \u201cAnd let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another\u2014and all the more as you see the Day approaching\u201d (Hebrews 10:24-25). \u201cLet the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts\u201d (Colossians 3:16). Rather than mandating Saturday (or Sunday) as a day of corporate worship, God lets us decide which day of the week to come together for worship. And when there are opportunities for worship, the new self in us responds: \u201cI rejoiced with those who said to me, \u2018Let us go to the house of the Lord\u2019\u201d (Psalm 122:1)."}
{"prompt": "Satan and conversations", "completion": "Can the enemy hear our conversation ?\n\n\nIn addressing Satan\u2019s abilities, let\u2019s start with his inabilities. As an angel, the devil is not omnipresent. Only God the Creator is (Psalm 139:7-10). Much as the human soul, housed in a body, can occupy only one space at one time, so the devil, a spirit being, can occupy only one space at one time.\nYet, as a spirit being without a body, the devil is able to move from one space to another faster than human beings can. And move he does. Job 1:7 and Job 2:2 describe the devil \u201croaming throughout the earth.\u201d 1 Peter 5:8 states that the devil \u201cprowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.\u201d Roaming and prowling describe the devil\u2019s non-stop activity as he moves from person to person, seeking to destroy them.\nWith this kind of activity, Satan and his helpers could hear our conversations. Then, again, keep in mind that Satan is not all-knowing as God is. Satan cannot read hearts and minds. Only God can do that (1 Kings 8:39). Satan operates by what he observes and hears.\nIt is good to be aware of Satan\u2019s power and limitations. Here is something else to keep in mind: we want to recognize that the devil has an accomplice inside each person. The sinful nature, passed on from generation to generation, is hostile toward God (Romans 8:7). The sinful nature hates anything good and godly and desires to do the devil\u2019s bidding (Galatians 5:19-21). So while the devil is not personally present in the life of a Christian 24/7, his ally, the sinful nature, is.\nWith spiritual enemies like these, what is a Christian to do? \u201cPut on the full armor of God\u201d (Ephesians 6:13) and launch a counter-offensive. That is not a foolhardy course of action. \u201cResist the devil, and he will flee from you\u201d (James 4:7) is God\u2019s instruction and promise. More than that, we combat our sinful nature through daily contrition and repentance, and we build up the new self through God\u2019s gospel in Word and sacrament (Ephesians 4:22-24)."}

{"prompt": "God's actions and presence", "completion": "Given that the Word and sacraments are the means of grace in the New Testament period, was there an equivalent for the Old Testament period? How do circumcision and the Passover relate to this?\r\n\r\nAlso, if Paul in Galatians describes circumcision as a work of the law, and condemns adding it to faith, how does he also directly tie circumcision to baptism in Romans? If Paul consistently presents baptism as gospel, why does he tie it to the Old Testament work of circumcision? Or was circumcision a work at all, or was that the view the Jews had taken on at the time?\r\n\r\nAnd I've recently found the idea of God's presence confusing. In the Old Testament, God's presence could be found in the Most Holy Place, which was accessed once per year by the High Priest. Does this mean God wasn't present in His Word throughout the Old Testament, at least when it had been recorded and written for the people? And no doubt Old Testament believers are saved the same as we are, through faith alone. All their sins were pardoned by Christ. If this is true, how does the idea of God's presence shift from the Old Testament to the New Testament?\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, from my understanding, there's seems to be a distinction between God's more general presence (omnipresence) and His special presence in the means of grace. Is this a correct way of thinking about His presence?\r\n\r\nThank you for all the help!\n\n\nGod the Holy Spirit has always used the Word of God to bring people to saving faith in Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah (Romans 10:17). For the male population of God\u2019s Old Testament people of Israel, circumcision was a seal of the righteousness that was theirs by God-given faith in the promised Messiah (Romans 4:11).\nAs the rite of circumcision no longer applies to followers of God in New Testament times, the apostle Paul rightly condemned the requirement to be circumcised, along with believing in Jesus Christ as Savior, to enjoy salvation. The book of Galatians addresses this.\nWhat that same apostle did in another inspired letter was to speak of a parallel between circumcision and Baptism: \u201c In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not performed by human hands. Your whole self ruled by the flesh was put off when you were circumcised by Christ, having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through your faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead\u201d (Colossians 2:11-12).\nThe original Passover gave the Israelites deliverance from their enemies. The ongoing Passover observance pointed ahead to the perfect Lamb of God, Jesus, who would take away the sins of the world (John 1:29).\nWhen it comes to the presence of God, the Bible teaches that God has many different modes of presence. He is omnipresent (Jeremiah 23:24; Psalm 139:7-10). He is present in the Lord\u2019s Supper, as we receive the Lord\u2019s body and blood, together with the bread and wine (1 Corinthians 10:16; 1 Corinthians 11:27). He is present with his church\u2014when two or three come together in his name, as you referenced. He is present with each believer, as our body is a temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19). He is present with each believer because he lives in them (John 17:20-23). Jesus was visibly present among people when he came to this world as true man (1 John 1:1-2).\nYour numerous questions could certainly receive fuller treatment, but this is about the best I could do with limited response space."}

Scripture directs us to act in faith not doubt (Romans 14:23).\nTo have a fuller conversation on this, consider speaking to your pastor. God\u2019s blessings to you."}
{"prompt": "Hymns and fellowship", "completion": "The WELS has a practice that a non-WELS member cannot sing or accompany during a service.  Why do you then allow non-WELS members who write hymns for the WELS hymnal?  In my eyes there is not much difference between the words of a hymn on the page or from the mouths and fingers of a musician.  Thank you for this ability to ask this question.\n\n\nI am understanding your first sentence to intend to say that a non-WELS member cannot sing \u201cin a way in which the person would be leading worship\u201d \u2013 for example, as a soloist. With that understanding in mind, allow me to pass along the following thoughts that addressed previous questions like yours.\n\u201cOur hymnody would be very limited if we sang hymns composed only by Lutherans. For instance, we would be without \u2018Silent Night\u2019 and \u2018Holy God, We Praise Your Name,\u2019 both written by Roman Catholics. We would be without \u2018Glory Be to God the Father\u2019and \u2018Your Works, Not Mine, O Christ,\u2019 both written by a Presbyterian. We would lose \u2018In the Cross of Christ I Glory,\u2019 written by a man most people think was an agnostic. The test of a good hymn is not the denominational background of its author, but the confessional character of its text.\n\u201cThe stanzas from \u2018Amazing Grace\u2019 that are included in Christian Worship speak correctly about the grace of God. If the text of any hymn (even one written by a Lutheran!) would contain doctrines that disagreed with the doctrines of the Bible, that hymn would not have been included in our book.\n\u201cWe are not in fellowship with the Baptist Church because it teaches many things that disagree with the teachings of the Bible. But we do not consider the Baptist Church to be a non-Christian denomination. It should not surprise us, therefore, that a Baptist is able to write a hymn text that speaks correctly about grace, even though he may not be able to write a hymn text that speaks correctly about original sin, infant Baptism, or Holy Communion.\n\u201cThe Lutheran Church has tended to consider or judge forms used for worship on the basis of their content rather than their source.\u201d\nA way of understanding this is that authors and composers present their works for use by Christians around the world. It is not as though the people who then use those hymns are stepping into the churches of the authors and composers and worshiping along with them. The same can be said about many of the musical pieces that our choirs use in our worship services."}

{"prompt": "Sin and sacrifice", "completion": "I'm having a hard time with this. I see so many verses in the Old Testament where God says not to practice human sacrifice of sons and daughters to other nations' gods. Why would God sacrifice His son? Thanks.\n\n\nGod\u2019s Fifth Commandment forbids murder (Exodus 20:13; Deuteronomy 32:39; Psalm 31:15). God wants to protect human life because it is a time of grace; it is the only time people have to be brought to a confession of their sins and a confession of faith in Jesus Christ as their Savior (2 Corinthians 6:1-2; Hebrews 9:27).\nBecause of the importance of human life, the sacrificial system for God\u2019s Old Testament people of Israel involved food or animals. You are correct in noting that God forbad human sacrifices. Scripture explains that people cannot save themselves or others. \u201cNo one can redeem the life of another or give to God a ransom for them\u2014the ransom for a life is costly, no payment is ever enough\u2014so that they should live on forever and not see decay\u201d (Psalm 49:7-9). Human sacrifices are sinful and accomplish nothing when it comes to the forgiveness of sins.\nBecause forgiveness of sins is God\u2019s work, he determined how he would display justice by punishing sin and also display love by forgiving sinners. The giving of his Son in life and in death is at the heart and center of God\u2019s plan of salvation. God gave of himself to save people who could not save themselves, no matter what they did (1 John 4:9-10). That is love\u2014amazing love."}
{"prompt": "Church/school raffle", "completion": "Is it ok to have a raffle promoted by a WELS church/school as a fund raiser for a youth field trip?\n\n\nThis is a decision the church/school will need to make after they study the matter. I can pass along the following information from answers to similar questions that contained some concern and caution.\nCongregational fundraising in the community can reinforce what many wrongly think in the first place\u2014that \u201call the church is concerned about is money.\u201d Congregational fundraising in the community can reinforce work-righteous thinking in some of the unchurched, leading them to think that \u201cI\u2019ve given to God, so I\u2019ve done my duty.\u201d Congregational fundraising in the community can undermine a church\u2019s efforts to encourage its members to grow in their management of God\u2019s blessings if they grow instead in their reliance on community revenue.\nThere certainly is a danger that fundraisers can fuel the idea that giving involves the possibility of getting or receiving something in return. It is important to keep in mind the motive for giving. It is love for God and gratitude for his love that provides the motivation for giving back to God what is his in the first place (2 Corinthians 5:15; 1 John 4:19).\nIf the church/school is looking for financial support from its own constituency and not the community in any way, free will offerings can go a long way in funding a youth field trip. Congregational members can be presented with the special opportunity to give towards this cause, and God\u2019s people will respond as they are moved. An approach like this eliminates difficulties associated with raffles and fundraising in general."}
{"prompt": "Sabbath Day laws", "completion": "I've been disturbed about one of the 10 Commandments, \"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.\" Luther's Small Catechism, #45, explains God does not require us to observe the Sabbath and other holy days of the OT.  I thought it peculiar that this commandment would be the only one omitted.  Matt.12:8 and Col. 2:16,17 are the stated supporting Scripture.  Reading the complete context of these verses, I understand it to be in reference to the Pharisees' (man's) laws added on to God's commandments in both Matthew and Colossians. Weren't Jesus, the Son, and the Holy Spirit present with the Father when Moses received the 10 Commandments?  Furthermore, the construction of the days of the week were named by the Romans after their pagan gods and there isn't clarity as to which day/days God designates as the 6 days of work and which is the 7th day of rest (which is first, and which is last).  Different people have different work days.  Since it isn't stated which days, wouldn't it mean after one works 6 days (whichever days one labors), labor ceases and rest in body and mind is to solely focus on God?  \r\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20; Deuteronomy 5) are part of the Mosaic Law that God gave to his Old Testament people of Israel. The Mosaic Law had limited purpose and duration. Its obligations ended when Jesus Christ came into our world as the fulfilment of all the prophecies of the Messiah.\nWe can see from the Mosaic Law wording of the third commandment (\u201cSabbath day\u201d) and the fourth commandment (reference to the Promised Land) that not all the content of the Ten Commandments applies to New Testament followers of the Lord.\nSo, how do Christians view the Ten Commandments? We rightly regard them as a summary of God\u2019s moral law: his will for all people of all time. We do see Jesus (Luke 18:20) and the apostle Paul (Romans 13:9) restating some of the commandments in a different order from the Old Testament listing. Presenting the commandments in that way illustrates how we, as New Testament Christians, are free from the Mosaic Law wording of the Ten Commandments and yet look to the Ten Commandments as a summary of God\u2019s will for our lives.\nThe language of Scripture is clear in pointing to the seventh day of the week (no matter what name we give it) as the Old Testament Sabbath Day. God set the pattern by working on the first six days and then resting on the seventh (Exodus 20:11).\nThere is something else to keep in mind as time went on: if God\u2019s people were going to find spiritual rest through their corporate worship of the one true God, they would need a common \u201cseventh day\u201d for their assembly. Saturday, the seventh day, was that day.\nThe Sabbath Day pointed ahead to Jesus. He has \u201crest\u201d for our souls through the forgiveness of sins (Matthew 11:28)."}
{"prompt": "Election and salvation", "completion": "Is it God\u2019s will for some people to go to hell? If I cannot by my own thinking or choosing believe in God, and the only reason I have faith is because the Holy Spirit gave it to me, did God choose me over other sinners? God loves all people, and Jesus died for all sinners, so why do some go to hell? I know that sometimes God makes bad things happen for good reasons, but how do I know that it\u2019s not his will for me (or anyone else) to go to hell? How does free will fit into all of this?\r\n\r\nThank you.\n\n\nThe Bible teaches that the antecedent will of God is that he wants all people to be saved (Ezekiel 33:11; 1 Timothy 2:4). The Bible teaches that the consequent will of God is that he will condemn those who reject him (Mark 16:16).\nWhile God desires the salvation of all people (2 Peter 3:9) and has provided a Savior for all people (John 3:16), the Bible also teaches that God has elected some to salvation (Ephesians 1:11-14). Those are teachings of the Bible that we human beings cannot harmonize. We entrust them to the counsel of God (Romans 11:33).\nWhen it comes to free will, our free will by nature is limited to making decisions about our earthly lives. Regarding spiritual matters, our free will by nature consists only of sinning and rejecting God. That natural condition underscores the truth of what you wrote: \u201cI cannot by my own thinking or choosing believe in God.\u201d Saving faith is God\u2019s gift (Ephesians 2:8). Saving faith is the result of God\u2019s election to grace (Acts 13:48).\nThe doctrine of election can create questions in our minds. That is understandable. God\u2019s ways are not our ways (Isaiah 55:8). What we want to keep in mind is that the doctrine of election was intended for our comfort. The comfort is that our salvation is in God\u2019s hand\u2014from beginning to end. He chose us in eternity. He sent a Savior. He gives us saving faith and he preserves us in that faith to the end of life. If salvation were up to us in any way, there would be reason for doubt and uncertainty. Because salvation is entirely God\u2019s work, it is a sure thing."}
{"prompt": "Reigning with Christ", "completion": "I'm currently learning more about the WELS. And I like everything they believe and teach so far.  My everyday question is this: what's the purpose of 1000 year reign of Christ?\n\n\nIt is good to read about your study of God\u2019s word.\nYour question addresses content from Revelation 20. We will want to keep in mind that Revelation 20 does not speak of a one-thousand-year reign of Christ. The chapter speaks of Christians reigning with Christ for a thousand years (Revelation 20:4, 6).\nIn the book of Revelation, numbers have symbolic meaning. That means that \u201ca thousand years\u201d in Revelation 20 means anything but one thousand years. The number ten and its multiples (for example, 100 and 1,000) represent \u201ccompleteness.\u201d Many biblical scholars understand the one-thousand-year period in Revelation 20 as representing the New Testament age.\nThis means that Revelation 20 speaks of Christians reigning with Christ during the New Testament age.\nConsider what meaning this had for the first recipients of the book of Revelation (the Christians who belonged to the seven churches in Asia Minor listed in Revelation 2 and 3). Christians in the late first century A.D. were facing extreme persecution. Christians were being killed for their faith. Did that mean that those people had lost everything? Were they to be pitied? Not at all. Their deaths meant that their souls were in the presence of God in heaven. Their deaths seated them on symbolic thrones and they reigned during the New Testament age with Christ\u2014the King whose reign is eternal (Psalm 146:10).\nThere are individuals and churches that teach Jesus will set up an earthly kingdom and reign over it for a period of 1,000 years. They seek to find support for this idea in Revelation 20. That chapter of the Bible does not teach that. No chapter of the Bible does. Revelation 20 describes martyred Christians reigning with the King of kings, Jesus Christ.\nGod bless your continued study of God\u2019s word!"}
{"prompt": "Smoking", "completion": "How do I explain the dangers of smoking and God\u2019s plan for us to a friend in a godly way? I\u2019m a WELS Lutheran, and have a Christian (Methodist) friend who smokes. After seeing what a relative of mine who smoked went through (gangrene, multiple amputations, necrotizing fasciitis, and eventually death), I\u2019ve tried to explain to her the dangers of smoking. She tried cutting back, and for a while was doing well, but eventually fell back into the habit. A year after my relative passed away, we got talking about the issue once, and by then, I could tell that she couldn\u2019t help but give up on quitting, as she asked me something to the tune of, \u201cIf God knows when we\u2019re all going to die, anyway, what\u2019s the point in quitting?\u201d I couldn\u2019t even answer that, as inside, my heart broke for her. I saw someone who would rather just give in and suffer any possible effects, than tough it out. I\u2019ll always be a friend to her, even if she\u2019s a smoker until her dying day, but I\u2019d just hate to see her possibly suffer the same horrible effects that my relative and millions of others have gone through. \n\n\nI commend you for your loving care and concern for your friend. You want what is best your friend and that includes her physical well-being.\nYou could point your friend to the Fifth Commandment. That commandment has the purpose of protecting life. The application of that commandment to our lives means that we take care of our bodies as best we can. This care addresses subjects such as diet, exercise and anything that can be harmful to our bodies.\nThere is more than God\u2019s law that addresses the care we give our bodies. The Bible\u2019s teaching of stewardship covers every area of our lives. Everything that we have and are belongs to God (Psalm 24:1). Faithful stewardship, management, of God\u2019s blessings includes our very bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19). This means that we will not want to do anything that could shorten our lives. We live with that mindset because we entrust ourselves to the loving care of God (Psalm 31:15).\nGod\u2019s blessings to you\u2014and your friend\u2014as you seek to work for the good of her body and soul."}
{"prompt": "Decision theology", "completion": "What is the WELS position on decision theology?\n\n\nIn This We Believe, a statement of belief of our church body, you will find this confession: \u201cWe believe that people cannot produce this justifying faith, or trust, in their own hearts, because \u2018the man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him\u2019 (1 Corinthians 2:14). In fact, \u2018the sinful mind is hostile to God\u2019 (Romans 8:7). It is the Holy Spirit who gives people faith to recognize that \u2018Jesus is Lord\u2019 (1 Corinthians 12:3). The Holy Spirit works this faith by means of the gospel (Romans 10:17). We believe, therefore, that a person\u2019s conversion is entirely the work of God\u2019s grace. Rejection of the gospel is, however, entirely the unbeliever\u2019s own fault (Matthew 23:37).\u201d\nDecision theology is not a teaching of the Bible."}
{"prompt": "Reaction to death", "completion": "When a father dies suddenly, leaving behind a wife and three daughters, all with college education and a long history of participation within the church and being confirmed in the church, is it common for the pastor and then the rest of the church to completely abandon them? Is it because as women they don't have any power/vote in the church that they are basically useless?\n\n\nOne can see pain and hurt in your words. I extend my sympathy to you in your loss. More than that, I want to remind you of the daily meaning Easter has for Christians like you. Because Jesus lives, those who believe in him have life eternal, even though they experience physical death (John 11:25-26; 14:19). May God always be a refuge and strength for you and your family.\nI, of course, do not have any information that might explain the reaction of others to your loss. Unfortunately, when death takes place, sometimes people\u2014even Christians\u2014do not know what to say. And so, rather than risk saying something wrong, they say nothing. That is not helpful, as your words indicate. Sometimes the best and the most Christians can do initially for a fellow Christian who has experienced the death of a loved one is simply to listen. In addition, they can point grieving Christians to the comfort of God\u2019s word.\nThe reaction of others to your loss certainly does not change your status with God. As a child of God, God\u2019s love for you began in eternity (Ephesians 1:4). His love brought you into his family (1 John 3:1). His love means you will enjoy a perfect and glorious eternity (Psalm 23:6). God bless you and your family."}
{"prompt": "Adam and Eve", "completion": "God didn't think too much of man to make him out of a pile of dirt.  Eve must not have had much of a brain; she didn't know snakes cannot talk. \r\n\n\n\nThere is no question here for me to answer, but your statements need a response.\nThe creation of Adam shows God\u2019s special care for human beings. Rather than focusing on the material God used to create Adam, keep in mind how unique Adam\u2019s creation was compared to everything else. Rather than speaking a word to bring about Adam\u2019s existence (as God did in creating everything else), God \u201cformed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being\u201d (Genesis 2:7). That special action speaks volumes about what God thought of man.\nGod made Adam and Eve to manage his creation (Genesis 1:28). God made Adam and Eve in his image (Genesis 1:27). That meant they were holy, they had perfect knowledge of God\u2019s will, and their wills were entirely in line with God\u2019s will. God\u2019s desire was that Adam and Eve enjoy his love forever. When sin threatened to separate them from his love forever, God promised a Savior (Genesis 3:15). In time, he sent his Son to be their Savior. All this says that God cared deeply for the people he made\u2014the crown of his creation.\nCreated in the image of God, Eve, like Adam, was highly intelligent. When it comes to Eve listening to a serpent (Satan), the Bible simply says that Eve was \u201cdeceived\u201d (1 Timothy 2:13).\nThe Bible is God\u2019s message to people. It is inspired and inerrant. God\u2019s desire is that we regard his word as \u201choly and gladly hear and learn it\u201d (Martin Luther\u2019s Explanation to the Third Commandment). I encourage you to read Psalm 119 to be reminded about that attitude toward God\u2019s word."}
{"prompt": "Events of Good Friday and Easter", "completion": "I\u2019m a little confused as to where Jesus went when he died. In the Apostles' Creed it says he \u201cdescended into hell. The third day he rose again....\u201d Where in the Bible do I find that Jesus descended into hell? \r\nOn the cross Jesus said to the thief that day he would be with him in paradise, which seems like Jesus would be in heaven right away. \r\nThanks so much for helping clear this up for me. \n\n\nWhen death takes place, a person\u2019s body and soul separate (Ecclesiastes 12:7). When Jesus died on Good Friday, his body remained on earth, while his soul went to heaven (Luke 23:46). The same was true for the repentant thief on the cross (Luke 23:43).\nResurrection is the reuniting of body and soul. Early on Easter Sunday morning, Jesus\u2019 body and soul were reunited in the tomb. Jesus descended into hell to proclaim victory over sin, Satan and death. Then, he appeared to his followers on earth as their risen Savior.\n1 Peter 3:18-20 teaches Jesus\u2019 descent into hell. Many see Colossians 2:15 as describing the triumphant nature of Jesus\u2019 descent into hell."}
{"prompt": "Prayer fellowship", "completion": "I was a WELS Lutheran.  (Now, I attend a Missouri Synod church.) One thing that I still feel I need a better understanding, and was part of the reason I felt called to leave the synod, is praying with family.  Why does WELS feel it is incorrect for me to say a table prayer or the Lord's prayer with my Christian brothers and sisters?  Thanks in advance for helping me understand your perspective.\n\n\nIt would be beneficial for you to read a thorough explanation of what the Bible teaches regarding fellowship, including prayer fellowship.\nChurch Fellowship, available from Northwestern Publishing House, provides such an explanation. Here is an excerpt: \u201cThe New Testament does not treat prayer fellowship separately from other forms of fellowship. Prayer as an act of fellowship is simply treated as one element among many others. The early Christians \u2018devoted themselves to the apostle\u2019s teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer\u2019 (Acts 2:42). There is, therefore, nothing in Scripture to suggest that prayer should be treated any differently from any other expression of fellowship. Since God-pleasing prayer always flows from faith, every prayer is an expression of faith and therefore an act of worship\u201d (pages 48 and 49)."}
{"prompt": "Sin of Adam and Eve", "completion": "I have always had this question and have grown up WELS and taught in the educational system. Why did the first man and woman God make sin?\r\n\r\n\n\n\nGod made Adam and Eve with the ability and freedom not to sin or to sin. Being all-knowing, God certainly knew that Satan and other angels would rebel against him, and that Adam and Eve would disobey his command. Being all-powerful, God certainly could have prevented both those falls into sin. The Bible does not provide an answer as to why God allowed sin to enter the world.\nWhat we do know from the Bible is this: not only did God know that sin was going to enter his creation, but he formulated a plan to rescue sinners. That plan involved the sacrifice of his Son (1 Peter 1:20; Revelation 13:8). In eternity, God also graciously chose people to be members of his family (Ephesians 1:11-14).\nThe Bible makes it clear that people are responsible for sin (James 1:13-15). God is not guilty of any wrongdoing (Deuteronomy 32:4; Isaiah 6:3).\nThe Bible teaches that Eve was \u201cdeceived\u201d by Satan (1 Timothy 2:14). Adam followed the actions of Eve (Genesis 3:6).\nWhen it comes to the \u201cwhy\u201d questions of life and the Bible, I turn to Romans 11:33-36: \u201cOh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out! \u2018Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?\u2019 \u2018Who has ever given to God, that God should repay them?\u2019 For from him and through him and for him are all things. To him be the glory forever! Amen.\u201d Those words tell me that while I live on this earth, I cannot expect to understand God\u2019s ways and thoughts fully. Like you, I look forward to the time when my knowledge of God and his ways and thoughts is much different than it is now (1 Corinthians 13:12)."}

I understand that hypnosis is not something that a person should do but I'm also wondering about acupuncture.  I can't find it in the question section.  Thank you.\n\n\nYou are correct. There have been no previous questions on the subject of acupuncture. But thank you for checking first.\nIt looks like little has been written on the subject in our circles. That literature contains cautions about New Age thinking that the practitioner could try to share with the person receiving treatment.\nWhile I am not in a position to endorse fully this assessment of acupuncture, the information illustrates how a confessional Lutheran church body views the practice."}
{"prompt": "The devil's abilities", "completion": "Can the devil still use somebody who has already proclaimed Christ?\n\n\nCan the devil tempt a Christian? Certainly (1 Peter 5:8). Can the devil use a Christian to tempt someone else? Certainly. There is an ally of Satan inside each Christian; it is the sinful nature (Romans 7:15-25).\nThese are reasons why the Bible instructs us to \u201cresist the devil\u201d (James 4:7). Thanks be to God that Jesus Christ successfully completed his mission of conquering the devil (1 John 3:8) and that he equips us to be successful in our daily skirmishes with the devil (Ephesians 6:10-17)."}
{"prompt": "Scapegoat", "completion": "Can a person be saved if they believe Satan is their scapegoat? Seventh Day Adventists teach this. They are careful to say that Satan is in no way a sin-bearer, but their prophet Ellen White wrote about this in The Great Controversy (Chapter 18, The Sanctuary).\r\n\r\nIf a person reads Ellen White and believes Satan bears the final penalty for their sin, are they believing in a false Jesus who didn't complete their atonement?\n\n\nThat is a conclusion one might make, but that is a conclusion Seventh-day Adventists reject. They state: \u201cSatan makes no atonement for our sins. But Satan will ultimately have to bear the retributive punishment for his responsibility in the sins of all men, both righteous and wicked. Seventh-day Adventists, therefore, repudiate in toto [their emphasis] any idea, suggestion, or implication that Satan is in any sense or degree our sin bearer. That thought is abhorrent to us, and appallingly sacrilegious. Such a concept is a dreadful disparagement of the efficacy of Christ and His salvation, and vitiates the whole glorious provision of salvation solely through our Savior.\u201d (Questions on Doctrine, page 400).\nWithout question, Seventh-day Adventist teaching fails to see the scapegoat on the great Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16) typifying the substitutionary work of Jesus Christ.\nThe larger problem is that Seventh-day Adventism fails to distinguish clearly between law and gospel. Ellen White, one of that church\u2019s early leaders that you cited, wrote: \u201cIn the Law is embodied the same principle as in the Gospel.\u201d The message of the law and the message of the gospel are in fact opposites. The law reveals our sin and our need for a Savior; the gospel shows us our Savior, Jesus. Jesus\u2019 loud cry on the cross, \u201cIt is finished\u201d (John 19:30), reveals that the Lord successfully completed his soul-saving mission. His triumphant resurrection from the dead guarantees it (Romans 4:25)."}
{"prompt": "Forbidden fruit", "completion": "Are we to literally take the account of Eve eating a piece of fruit as the reason mankind deserves to die and suffer in hell? Thanks.\n\n\nThe genre of Genesis 3 is narrative. The content of the chapter records historical events. There is nothing in the chapter that suggests any content is to be understood symbolically or figuratively.\nWhen it comes to Adam and Eve\u2019s sin, what is more important than the content of God\u2019s command is the command itself.\u00a0 What I mean is this:\u00a0 God could have commanded Adam and Eve not to do something else, and their violation of that other command would have amounted to sin. \u201cEveryone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness\u201d (1 John 3:4). Transgression, another word for sin, means to step across a forbidden line.\nMartin Luther addressed your question with these words: \u201cTo reason it seems very ridiculous that any one fruit should be so deadly as to destroy the whole human race in infinite succession, and destroy it, moreover, with eternal death. But this power of destruction did not lie in the fruit. To be sure, Adam sank his teeth into the fruit; but in reality he sank them into a thorn, which was the prohibition of God and disobedience to God. This is the real cause of the evil, to wit, that Adam sins against God, whose command he ignores. He follows Satan. The tree of knowledge of good and evil was a good tree, bearing the choicest fruits, but because the prohibition of God is joined to it and man does not heed the prohibition, it turns into the deadliest of all poisons.\u201d (What Luther Says, Volume III, Page 1290)"}
{"prompt": "The life to come", "completion": "My husband died about 16 months ago at the age of 82.  He had a twin sister who only lived two days.   She was baptized.  When his soul got to heaven, could he meet the soul of his twin sister?  Would she still be a baby?  At the time of the resurrection, will she be resurrected as a two-day-old baby? In answer to a similar question a number of years ago in a Bible class, the WELS pastor indicated the possibility of a baby who dies being in heaven as a healthy young adult and a person who dies at an advanced age being in heaven as in their prime of life years.  Thank you.\n\n\nSuch a reunion that you asked about will certainly take place. 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 describes the Lord gathering together those Christians who died and those Christians who are alive on the earth at the time of his visible return on the Last Day. When the Lord gathers together his Church, this truth remains: \u201cAnd so we will be with the Lord forever\u201d (1 Thessalonians 4:17).\nThe Bible does not address the subject of resurrected bodies of Christians as to their appearance in earthly age. The Bible does teach this: \u201cThe body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable; it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body\u201d (1 Corinthians 15:42-44). What was said in that Bible class is certainly possible with a God who can do all things.\nWhile we may presently lack answers to some of our specific questions about heaven, the Bible gives us enough information that we can \u201cencourage one another\u201d (1 Thessalonians 4:18). And so, receive my encouragement to continue looking forward to the time when God\u2019s people will enjoy a perfect and glorious life with God\u2014forever."}
{"prompt": "Translation help", "completion": "Someone told me that in the original Greek, the Bible didn\u2019t say to a man: do not lie with another man but that it says don\u2019t lie with a boy (to prevent abuse).  Please help. \n\n\nIt looks like your request is addressing Leviticus 20:13. The 1984 NIV rendered that verse this way: \u201cIf a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable.\u201d The 2011 NIV puts that verse this way: \u201cIf a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable.\u201d\nThe Hebrew language, the primary language of the Old Testament, has several words that can be translated \u201cman.\u201d The Hebrew word that is translated \u201cwith a man\u201d in the verse above refers to a \u201cman\u201d or a \u201cmale.\u201d\nContext will determine the particular shading of words. So, for example, the Hebrew word referenced can mean \u201cboy\u201d in some contexts. That is what we find in Jeremiah 20:15: \u201cCursed be the man who brought my father the news, who made him very glad, saying, \u2018A child is born to you\u2014a son!\u2019\u201d The context of that verse makes it clear that the Hebrew word is not speaking of a man but a male child.\nThe context of Leviticus 20 makes it clear that there is a contrast with \u201cwoman.\u201d \u201cIf a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable.\u201d God designed sexual relations to take place between a man and a woman in marriage. Leviticus 20:13 condemns the practice of a man having sexual relations with another man as he would with a woman (in marriage).\nPeople who support same-sex activity and same-sex marriage look for the Bible to differentiate between abusive same-sex relationships and consenting same-sex relationships: condemning the former but approving the latter. The Bible makes no distinction like that; it forbids and condemns all sexual relations that take place between men only and between women only.\nWhile Leviticus 20:13 (and Leviticus 18:22) were part of the Mosaic code that governed Old Testament Israel, we find the same condemnation of same-sex activity in Romans 1:24-32 and 1 Corinthians 6:9-10.\nWith that last passage in mind, it is important to note that it is not particular sins that keep people out of the kingdom of God; it is impenitence and unbelief. God wants all to come to repentance and believe in him to enjoy salvation (1 Timothy 2:4; 2 Peter 3:9)."}
{"prompt": "Defending self and family", "completion": "With the gaining popularity of people obtaining concealed carry permits, I would like to ask WELS' stance on potential lethal use of a weapon.\r\nMy thoughts are that in Exodus 22:1-3 lethal force can be used if yours or your family's lives are in danger, but not if it is clear the threat is non-life-threatening. In either case, it should only be used as a last resort.\r\n   \n\n\nThe Hebrew word in the Fifth Commandment (Exodus 20:13 and Deuteronomy 5:17) prohibits murder\u2014the illegal and inappropriate ending of human life\u2014and does not forbid all taking of life. So, for example, governments can rightly implement capital punishment (Romans 13:4) if they so choose.\nWhat about individuals who want to protect themselves and their families, you wonder? Some Christians look to Matthew 5:39 and Romans 12:17 as absolute directives not to resist physical threats. In their context though the verses advocate love toward others instead of seeking revenge.\nOthers look to sections of Scripture like Proverbs 24:11-12 and Luke 22:35-38 as the basis for defending oneself and one\u2019s family from physical threats.\nProtecting our own life (self-defense) could result in the death of another person. That is not murder. Exodus 22:2-3 illustrates the law God gave his people of Israel regarding defending oneself from a thief."}
{"prompt": "Necessity of Baptism", "completion": "Does a person have to be baptized to go to heaven?\n\n\nNo. Think of all the Old Testament believers who were not baptized\u2014as Baptism had not yet been instituted. Jesus stated that it is the lack of faith, not Baptism, that condemns (Mark 16:16).\nWe speak of Baptism being necessary in the sense that the Lord commands us to administer it. However, Baptism not absolutely necessary for salvation because the Holy Spirit can bring people to saving faith in Jesus through the gospel in Word alone. In situations like that, people will still want to be baptized\u2014to do what Jesus says and to receive, in addition to the message of the Bible, another guarantee of God\u2019s love and forgiveness in Christ."}
{"prompt": "Melchizedek", "completion": "What does WELS teach about Melchizedek's birth, death and his priesthood?\n\n\nHebrews 7:3 explains that we do not know anything about the beginning or end of Melchizedek\u2019s life. He appears and disappears on the pages of Scripture.\nMelchizedek served as \u201cpriest of God Most High\u201d (Genesis 14:18). As priest, he served the only true God, the God of the Bible.\nMore than that, Melchizedek served as king (Genesis 14:18). That was unusual because a person served as a priest or a king but not both. By serving in those offices, Melchizedek pointed ahead to Jesus, who is Prophet, Priest and King."}
{"prompt": "Cremation and Judgment Day", "completion": "If I get cremated, will my soul go to heaven and on Judgment Day my ashes be made back into my body even though I have no skeleton? If I choose cremation, is that OK with God?\n\n\nWhen a Christian dies, the soul immediately goes to heaven (Ecclesiastes 12:7; Luke 23:43; Hebrews 9:27). Burial or cremation take place after that. Choosing cremation over traditional burial will not affect your eternal relationship with God.\nAfter sin entered the world, God announced to Adam, \u201cBy the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you will return\u201d (Genesis 3:19). As the wages of sin (Romans 6:23), death would be the common experience for people, and the body would begin the process of decomposition at death. In the end, cremation essentially speeds up the process that occurs with burial.\nRegardless of cremation or burial, \u201c\u2026a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his [Jesus\u2019] voice and come out\u201d (John 5:28-29).\nSince the Bible is silent on the subject of cremation, Christians are free to choose burial or cremation."}
{"prompt": "Satan's power", "completion": "Why did God make the world belong to the devil when He was able to defeat the devil?\n\n\nBecause God is all-powerful, he certainly could have prevented the fall of the angels and the subsequent fall of Adam and Eve. God does not explain why he did not prevent those falls\u2014nor is he obligated to do so (Romans 11:33-36).\nAfter the devil led Adam and Eve into sin, God promised a Savior (Genesis 3:15). That Savior would crush Satan one day. By his holy life, sacrificial death and glorious resurrection, Jesus did crush Satan. The devil\u2019s final defeat will take place on the Last Day, when he will be confined to hell forever (Revelation 20:10).\nUntil the Last Day, Satan retains power and influence as allowed by God (Job 1:12; 2:6). Because of his power and influence, the devil has the title \u201cthe prince of this world.\u201d (John 12:31). As mentioned previously, the day will come when that \u201cprince\u201d will be crushed completely and be unable to bother God\u2019s people anymore.\nUntil that time, God\u2019s people recognize the power and evil intent of Satan (1 Peter 5:8), and they use the spiritual weapons God has given them to be successful in warding off the old evil foe (Ephesians 6:10-18; James 4:7)."}
{"prompt": "Gay wedding invite", "completion": "How do I respond to a family member\u2019s gay wedding invite?\n\n\nRomans 14:14, 23 teaches us not to act contrary to our conscience. If you are convinced that it would be wrong for you even to attend the ceremony, then it would be wrong for you. On the other hand, you might be convinced that you can, in good conscience, attend the ceremony.\nYour attendance or absence from the ceremony is not the most important matter here. More important is what you communicate to your family member about your presence or absence.\nIf you choose to attend, you can explain that you came because you love your family member, not because you agree with same-sex marriages.\nOn the other hand, if you choose not to attend, you can explain to your family member that you thought through how best to show love to him or her and also stand up for the truths of Scripture, and you settled on not attending.\nThe decision on what to do with the wedding invitation is entirely yours. Most important is what you communicate to your family member regarding your decision. Speak the truth in love to your family member (Ephesians 4:15), provide Christian witness and example, and keep your relative in your prayers. God bless you."}
{"prompt": "Promoting a series", "completion": "Why doesn\u2019t WELS promote The Chosen series on the life and ministry of Jesus?\n\n\nNot promoting that series is consistent with our church body\u2019s policy of not taking an official position on books, movies or television shows. Occasionally, Forward in Christ offers reviews of books published by Northwestern Publishing House."}
{"prompt": "Other ministries", "completion": "What can you tell me about Todd Friel [Wretched Radio], John MacArthur, or Colin A. Miller?\r\nI have watch several of their YouTube videos and they seem sound, but I would like a WELS opinion.\r\nThank you.\n\n\nLike the apostle Paul (Philippians 1:18), we can rejoice whenever\u2014and by whomever\u2014the gospel of Jesus Christ is proclaimed. At the same time, Scripture instructs us to \u201cwatch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Keep away from them.\u201d (Romans 16:17)\nA brief look at the websites of the ministries of the first two individuals reveals errors regarding the Bible\u2019s teaching of the End Times. There is also the denial of the sacraments as means of grace. I was not able to find doctrinal statements for the third individual you mentioned."}
{"prompt": "Cremation and resurrection", "completion": "If a Christian is cremated and their ashes are, say, sprinkled all over the place (e.g. little in WI, MI, SD, MN) etc...where will our body come out when we hear Jesus? Should a Christian's ashes not be sprinkled around, but rather kept together in one burial place?\n\n\nThe Bible describes the resurrection\u2014and transformation of the bodies of all Christians\u2014as being instantaneous (1 Corinthians 15:51-52). The God who made all things from nothing (Genesis 1) will raise the bodies of all who have died and reunite bodies and souls (John 5:28-29). Nothing is impossible for our all-powerful God (Jeremiah 32:27).\nFollowers of the Lord enjoy Christian freedom to choose between cremation or traditional burial. The Bible does not address the subject of dividing the cremains."}
{"prompt": "Satan and redemption", "completion": "One of my closest friends told me that Satan can be redeemed and still have some good inside him even though he's pure evil.  I had some conflicts because of her explanation and I wanted to be sure:  is this true?\n\n\nThere is no possibility of redemption for Satan and all the evil angels. Jude 6 explains: \u201cAnd the angels who did not keep their positions of authority but abandoned their proper dwelling\u2014these he has kept in darkness, bound with everlasting chains for judgment on the great Day.\u201d\nRevelation 20:10 describes that judgment: \u201cAnd the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented day and night for ever and ever.\u201d Jesus also spoke of that judgment in Matthew 25:41."}
{"prompt": "Necromancy", "completion": "What does the Bible say about necromancy?\n\n\nThe Bible clearly condemns the practice of trying to communicate with those who have died. Consider the following sections of Scripture.\n\u201cLet no one be found among you who sacrifices their son or daughter in the fire, who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, or casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead. Anyone who does these things is detestable to the LORD; because of these same detestable practices the LORD your God will drive out those nations before you. You must be blameless before the LORD your God. The nations you will dispossess listen to those who practice sorcery or divination. But as for you, the LORD your God has not permitted you to do so\u201d (Deuteronomy 18:10-14).\n\u201cWhen someone tells you to consult mediums and spiritists, who whisper and mutter, should not a people inquire of their God? Why consult the dead on behalf of the living? Consult God\u2019s instruction and the testimony of warning. If anyone does not speak according to this word, they have no light of dawn\u201d (Isaiah 8:19-20)."}
{"prompt": "Critical race theory", "completion": "What is our (WELS) official position on Critical Race Theory?  \n\n\nYou will find \u201cofficial position\u201d statements of our church body here. Those statements do not address the subject of your inquiry."}
{"prompt": "Gratitude for devotion", "completion": "This is a comment, don't know where else to put it. Whoever wrote today's Daily Devotion (5/6/21), I want to express my gratitude to that person.  It was one of the best I have seen posted! Thank you and may God bless you all richly. Google News has posted several of your articles! Accidentally saw them as I don't go there often. \n\n\nThank you for your kind words. I will pass along your words of appreciation to the author of the devotion."}
{"prompt": "Use of enneagram", "completion": "I am curious about the WELS stance on use of the enneagram, which has become popularized in many churches. Thanks.\n\n\nThere is no official position or stance of our church body regarding the use of the enneagram. While I am not in a position to endorse fully this assessment of that practice, the information illustrates how a confessional Lutheran church body approaches the subject."}
{"prompt": "Satan on earth", "completion": "After Satan's fall from heaven, why did God put Satan on earth in Paradise with Adam and Eve instead of another part of the universe without life?\n\n\nGod banished Satan and all the evil angels to hell after they rebelled against him (2 Peter 2:4; Jude 6). In his wisdom, God allows the fallen angels and their leader to roam the earth (Job 1:7; 2:2; 1 Peter 5:8). In his wisdom, God allowed Satan to tempt Eve in the Garden of Eden\u2014as you noted.\nIn the Bible, God does not explain his actions, nor does he need to (Romans 11:33-36). What the Bible does teach is that God controls Satan\u2019s activities (Revelation 20:3), and the day is coming when Satan and all the evil angels will be confined to hell forever (Revelation 20:10). That ultimate confinement will take place because Jesus successfully carried out his mission of destroying the devil\u2019s work (1 John 3:8)."}
{"prompt": "God and good", "completion": "I recently heard of something called the Euthyphro Dilemma in Plato's Dialogue, which paraphrased, asks the question, \"Are morally good acts good because God commands them or does God command them because they are good?\" The dilemma is designed to somehow separate God and \"religion\" from morality, and basically suggests that morality is independent of religion. I know this is wrong, as I understand that everything God commands is perfect and holy. I am just wondering what a good counter argument to this dilemma is. \n\n\nAny discussion of \u201cgood\u201d starts and ends with God. Jesus explained, \u201cThere is only One who is good\u201d (Matthew 19:17). \u201cGood\u201d does not exist because God says so. There is good in the world because God is good. The \u201ccounter argument\u201d would focus not on the words of God but the essence of God.\nOur Great Heritage addresses your question this way: \u201cThe question has been asked: Does God decree the good because it is good? Or is the good good because God decreed it? The answer must be: Neither. God is not subject to any standard or idea of good over and above himself; nor does he arbitrarily decree that anything should be good, while he might perhaps just as well declare the very opposite to be good. Rather, God, who is, is perfection in every respect.\u201d (Volume 1, page 498)"}
{"prompt": "Cursing", "completion": "I was talking to someone who told me that the Bible says that people can put a curse on me. He also said that in the Bible there is a prayer that will remove a curse. How do I answer that? I have read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation a number of times but never read this about curses. Can you give me some information about curses in the Bible? \n\n\nAccording to the Bible, cursing is using God\u2019s name to wish evil on someone or something. God\u2019s Second Commandment forbids such speech and actions (Romans 12:14; James 3:10).\nA curse spoken against you, a child of God, amounts to idle words. God is not bound to carry out the whims and wishes of people who act contrary to his will (Psalm 109:28). Romans 8:31-39 describes God\u2019s strong, enduring love for his children.\nI am not aware of the prayer that was mentioned to you."}
{"prompt": "Baptism for granddaughter", "completion": "My granddaughter is 11 years old and is just going to be baptized. How do I explain to her what she all needs to know? She has had no religious teaching. Her parents are separated and so far has had a hard life. The only reason she is getting baptized now is because I said I would like to see her baptized before I pass away. Help.\r\n\n\n\nYou can count on your pastor to explain to your granddaughter what Baptism is all about. You can tell her that God works through Baptism to guarantee the forgiveness of sins and eternal life. You can share Bible passages like the following with her: Mark 16:16; Acts 2:38; Galatians 3:26-27; Titus 3:5-7; and, 1 Peter 3:21. God\u2019s blessings to you both!"}
{"prompt": "Adult confirmation and Baptism", "completion": "Does an adult have to be confirmed before they can be baptized?\n\n\nRecognizing that the Bible does not command Confirmation, the answer is \u201cno.\u201d Because there is Christian freedom in this area, practices will vary. Some adults might want to wait until their course of Bible instruction is completed before they are baptized. Others might desire to be baptized as they learn about God\u2019s love for them and the blessings of Baptism. Our pastors will work with adults and treat each situation individually."}
{"prompt": "Athanasian Creed and Trinity", "completion": "If I'm reading the Athanasian Creed correctly, it says a belief in the Trinity is necessary for salvation. Could you please elaborate on this a little bit? How could a person be lost if they don't believe in the Trinity, which is a difficult concept for people to comprehend. I believe in the Trinity, but I've always found the Athanasian Creed a bit troubling because I do not fully understand how a belief in the Trinity relates to the Gospel. Maybe it is simply because the Athanasian Creed was written to combat heresies that said Jesus was only a man?\n\n\nYou are reading and understanding the Athanasian Creed correctly. The Bible teaches that there is salvation only through faith in Jesus Christ, the Son of God (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).\nAs you suggested, the Athanasian Creed was written to combat heresies that Jesus is inferior to God the Father. If Jesus is not God, then God is not triune; a denial of Jesus is a denial of the Father (John 5:22-23).\nThe doctrine of the Trinity certainly \u201cis a difficult concept for people to comprehend.\u201d Thankfully, saving faith does not mean that people need to understand all the complexities of biblical doctrines. Saving faith is trust, acceptance and reliance on what God declares about himself and his works (Hebrews 11:1). Saving faith is trust in the God the Bible, who reveals himself in Scripture as a triune God.\nThe Athanasian Creed does not condemn Christians who struggle to understand a God who is far superior to them in every way. The Athanasian Creed does condemn those who deny the deity of Christ and the doctrine of the Trinity."}
